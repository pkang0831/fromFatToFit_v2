Don't rely too much on InBody for dieting - Body Visual Part 2

I am working hard on my diet.

If the weight measured on the scale is not decreasing well or

There are people whose body fat measured by InBody does not decrease easily.

I noticed that there are people struggling with this issue in the comments, so I would like to talk about eye body measurements.

In the last video, I mentioned that I am doing well with my diet, but...

We talked about the reasons why weight may not decrease.

The video link is displayed in the upper right corner.

If you are curious about the content of the previous video, you can click to watch it.

In this video, I will talk about InBody.

In the past, when there was no InBody, weight was mainly used as an indicator of diet success.

Due to the reasons mentioned in Part 1 of the video, there is an increasing opinion that it is difficult to trust weight.

As the awareness that body fat and muscle mass are more important than weight has strengthened,

There has been an increased interest in InBody, which can measure body fat and muscle mass.

Due to the increased interest, home body composition devices have been released.

Since I have a home body composition device, I measure my body composition every day.

Depending on the results, I sometimes adjust the direction of my diet.

This home body composition device is not very accurate.

If a home device that costs around 50,000 won can accurately measure body composition from the start,

You won't need to use much more expensive equipment at a professional fitness center or hospital.

As it is an inexpensive device, it was not designed to measure accurately from the beginning.

Because it cannot be measured accurately and there is an error present.

The program is designed to reduce this error.

This can lead to situations where one cannot laugh.

This is a story from my acquaintance's experience.

After waking up in the morning, I measured my body composition with the InBody.

I haven't eaten or drunk anything.

I had an enormous bowel movement in the bathroom.

I thought I must have lost at least a few hundred grams, so I measured my body composition again.

They said they were disappointed because their weight and body composition did not change at all.

It’s not that your weight or body composition hasn’t changed at all.

The program is designed not to reflect short-term changes in weight or body composition.

The program designed to reduce errors is actually causing more errors.

There are many other errors with InBody as well.

For example, if you measure your body composition right after waking up in the morning, your body fat percentage may be measured as high.

If you measure your body composition after exercising, your body fat percentage will be measured as high.

Even with a low-sodium diet, body fat percentage is measured to be high.

On the contrary, if you consume a lot of salt or do not exercise, your body fat percentage is measured to be low.

Isn't it bad for dieting to not exercise and eat a lot of salt?

Why is it that bad behavior is associated with a lower body fat percentage?

It's due to body water.

The method used by InBody to measure body composition involves passing a weak electrical current.

In the case of muscles, because they contain water, a high body water content is measured as having a lot of muscle.

If a person is measured to have more muscle at the same weight, their body fat percentage will relatively decrease.

We can't drink water while we sleep at night.

However, since moisture is continuously evaporating from our bodies,

When you wake up in the morning, your body is in a state of significant dehydration.

So that's why I'm thirsty in the morning.

However, if you measure your body composition in a state where body water has decreased like this,

Because body water has decreased, muscle mass is measured as low, and relatively, body fat percentage appears high.

When exercising, having a high body fat percentage can also occur.

Similarly, it is a phenomenon that occurs due to a decrease in body water.

When you exercise, you deplete the glycogen stored in your muscles.

Glycogen is stored along with water when it is stored.

When glycogen is depleted, the water stored with it is released, leading to a reduction in body water.

When body water decreases, muscle mass decreases, and body fat percentage is measured higher.

In the case of salt, consuming a lot can increase body water.

If you consume a lot of salt, your body water increases, which can lead to a measurement of higher muscle mass.

When muscle mass is measured to be high, the body fat percentage tends to decrease.

So if I check my body composition every day and try to adjust my diet plan accordingly,

To get good InBody results, you should eat salty food and not exercise.

In fact, in the case of an acquaintance I know, they measured their body composition every single day.

Since I started exercising, my muscle mass has actually decreased.

Are you saying that muscles are decreasing in order to secure the energy needed for exercise?

I also stopped exercising.

As I adjusted my diet according to the InBody results,

It ended up going in a rather unfavorable direction.

In summary, the InBody itself has a considerable amount of error.

Behaviors that are not good for dieting can actually show positive results in body composition measurements.

Measuring your body composition every day and being overly concerned with those numbers is not very beneficial.

Measure it once every two weeks or once a month.

Even taking the margin of error into account, is there a difference compared to before in terms of dieting?

It is advisable to check only this much.

I'm just checking if the direction of my diet is correct.

Don't trust the scale, don't trust the body composition analysis. So what should I trust then?

You can trust your body.

The truth is that the reason we diet is ultimately to create a visually appealing body.

I mentioned it in the beauty weight series, but...

If you appear slim and pretty on the outside, then at that time, regardless of your weight, it is considered a beauty weight.

Conversely, if someone appears to be overweight, then at that time, regardless of their actual weight, they are considered to be at an obese weight.

In reality, if you have a lot of muscle mass, you may be classified as overweight numerically, but you can have a slim and beautiful body.

In the case of skinny obesity, although the numbers may indicate that one is slim,

In reality, it looks obese.

I've heard a lot about trusting your body, but how should I actually look at my body?

Can I just take a picture and see it?

No matter how I look at it, I can't tell if it's missing...

In the next video, I will talk about how to assess your body visually.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the third part of the body measurement video,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
