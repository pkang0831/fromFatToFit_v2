Filling calories with tteokbokki, fried foods, and chicken versus filling calories with healthy foods.

What is the difference between these two?

A question with this content was posted in the comments, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the comments.

I'm really enjoying your videos, pkang. I'm currently on a diet.

I exercise by walking 10,000 steps every day and consume about 1500 to 2000 calories daily.

But I have a question.

Filling calories with tteokbokki, fried food, and chicken, and

What difference does it make to fill calories with healthy food?

Of course, healthy food is good for health, but...

From a dieting perspective, if the calories are the same, doesn't it not matter what you eat?

You can just burn off the calories from the food you eat through your basal metabolic rate and exercise.

I'm really curious about this part. As long as body fat doesn't increase, it's fine.

I always feel anxious every time I eat processed food.

This is a comment that says. Let's discuss it in detail.

From a dieting perspective, doesn't it matter what you eat as long as the calories are the same?

The reason this question arises is due to the calorie diet theory.

Comparing the calorie intake from food with the calorie expenditure of my body.

If the calorie intake is greater than the calorie expenditure,

Excess calories are stored as body fat, leading to weight gain.

Conversely, if the calories consumed are greater than the calories burned,

You lose weight because you draw the insufficient calories from body fat.

This is the calorie diet theory.

The theory itself is simple, making it easy to understand and quite persuasive.

So in the past, it was often referred to as the truth of dieting.

Many people still think that way.

So when understanding diet theories

There are quite a few cases where it is understood based on calories.

For example, when it comes to a diet plan, one naturally thinks that it should have low calories.

I think that since the calories need to be low, I should eat as little fat as possible.

The reason why vegetables are said to be good for dieting is that they are low in calories.

The reason people often think of chicken breast salad when it comes to diet meals is because of this.

Chicken breast is one of the cuts of meat that has the lowest fat content.

I eat this chicken breast with low-calorie vegetables.

If you understand dieting based on calories like this,

Foods like tteokbokki, chicken, and fried snacks are

In the end, it makes me think that it's not good for dieting because it has a high calorie content.

In that case, just eating a little bit of that kind of food...

If you eat the same amount of calories as a diet plan,

Since the calorie intake is the same,

Isn't there essentially no difference from a dieting perspective? That's what I'm thinking.

However, there is a difference.

Among the popular ramen in Korea, there is a type called Bibim-myeon.

It's ramen mixed with a sweet and sour seasoning.

If we compare eating this bibim-myeon on its own to eating it with vegetables,

Which side will gain more weight?

When eating vegetables with bibim-myeon, do you eat less bibim-myeon in proportion to the amount of vegetables you eat?

No, that's not the case. The amount of bibim noodles I ate is the same.

Those who eat vegetables with bibim-myeon consume the same amount of bibim-myeon and additionally eat more vegetables.

From a calorie perspective, the combination of vegetables and bibim-myeon has a higher calorie count.

Those who only eat bibim-myeon are consuming only the calories from the bibim-myeon.

The side that ate bibim-myeon with vegetables consumed the calories from the bibim-myeon along with the additional calories from the vegetables.

According to the calorie diet theory, eating bibim-myeon with vegetables should lead to more weight gain.

Because the calories consumed are higher.

However, in reality, it is not like that.

In fact, eating only bibim-myeon without low-calorie vegetables is more likely to make you gain weight.

To understand why this happens, you need to know about blood sugar and insulin.

The carbohydrates we eat are converted into glucose in the body.

It will move through the blood.

At this time, the concentration of glucose in the blood is referred to as blood sugar.

If you eat a lot of carbohydrates, the glucose in your blood increases, leading to high blood sugar levels.

Conversely, if the glucose in the blood decreases, blood sugar levels drop.

If blood sugar levels remain high, inflammation occurs in the blood vessel walls.

Our body tries to maintain a stable blood sugar level.

So when blood sugar rises, we try to lower it again.

The hormone that lowers blood sugar is called insulin.

Insulin lowers blood sugar by storing glucose in the blood as glycogen and body fat.

It's not just about lowering blood sugar levels.

Help proteins to be used for muscle synthesis.

It can also store fat as body fat.

Considering that the raw material for glucose is carbohydrates,

In the end, it's a hormone that processes carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

From here, we can understand two things.

In a situation where the first blood sugar rises quickly and significantly,

To lower that blood sugar, insulin will be released quickly and in large amounts.

One of the functions of the second insulin is to store glucose as body fat.

Because fat is stored as body fat.

The more insulin is released, the more body fat increases.

Simply put, it means gaining weight.

With these two things in mind, let's return to the story of bibim-myeon that we discussed earlier.

When comparing the changes in blood sugar levels after eating bibim-myeon and vegetable bibim-myeon,

Before eating, my blood sugar was between 116 and 122, and the vegetable bibimyeon was actually higher.

However, when we look at the blood sugar changes after eating at 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours,

The blood sugar of the group that only ate bibim-myeon continues to rise for up to 2 hours after the meal.

The maximum blood sugar level two hours after eating is 185.

On the other hand, the maximum blood sugar level for vegetable bibim-myeon is 137 two hours after eating.

Two hours after a meal, blood sugar levels return to pre-meal levels.

The maximum blood sugar level for vegetable bibim noodles is 137 within 2 hours.

Just looking at the post-meal blood sugar level of 156 after eating bibim-myeon,

You can see that the blood sugar from the bibim-myeon rises very quickly.

Looking at the maximum blood sugar level of 185, you can see how much the blood sugar increases.

If blood sugar rises quickly and significantly like this,

Of course, insulin will be released quickly and in large amounts.

And as I mentioned earlier,

When insulin is released quickly and in large amounts, body fat also increases quickly and significantly.

So, it means that regular bibim-myeon is more fattening than vegetable bibim-myeon.

No, the calories of bibim-myeon are fixed, so how can you gain more weight?

For example, if bibim-myeon is 500 kcal,

As blood sugar rises quickly and significantly, body fat increases by about 600 kcal to 700 kcal.

This is not it.

Calories that haven't even entered the body cannot be stored as body fat.

The reason why regular bibim-myeon is said to be more fattening than vegetable bibim-myeon is

Vegetable bibim noodles have a higher calorie content, but the amount absorbed and stored by the body is lower.

So, not all the calories you consume are absorbed and stored.

This is the biggest flaw in the calorie diet theory.

The calorie diet theory assumes that all the calories from the food consumed are absorbed by the body.

If you eat food that contains 500 kcal, it is assumed that all 500 kcal is absorbed by the body.

No matter what food you eat, it all gets absorbed by the body.

I don't care what food was eaten.

I only consider the calories that the food contains.

So, according to the calorie diet theory, it doesn't matter what food you eat as long as the calories are the same.

However, that's not actually the case.

A person cannot absorb 100% of the calories from the food they eat.

The amount absorbed varies depending on the type of food.

So, even if the calories are the same or even higher, if the amount absorbed is less, then...

In reality, the calories that actually enter the body can be lower.

Filling up on calories with tteokbokki, fried foods, and chicken, and

What is the difference in filling calories with healthy food?

Foods like tteokbokki, fried snacks, and chicken are foods that cause a lot of insulin to be released.

Healthy foods are those that cause less insulin to be released.

Even if you consume the same amount of calories, tteokbokki, fried foods, and chicken are more likely to make you gain weight.

It's not the same.

To summarize what has been discussed so far,

First, the food we eat is broken down into nutrients through digestion.

The amount of nutrients in each food and the speed at which they are digested vary.

The second calorie measures the energy of the nutrients contained in food.

The speed at which food is digested is a figure that has not been considered at all.

Therefore, calories can be a tool to measure the amount of energy contained in food, but

It is not an absolute standard for dieting.

Even if the calories are high, if digestion is slow, the actual amount absorbed by the body may be low.

Even with foods that have the same calories, the amount absorbed can vary depending on the speed of digestion.

When dieting, rather than just controlling calories,

It is better to pay more attention to the types of food you eat.

I understood the explanation well, but what should I do to lose weight?

What should I eat?

In the past, while explaining the principles of dieting, I discussed what foods should be eaten.

We talked in detail about how to plan a diet.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top left.

I understand why tteokbokki, fried foods, and chicken are more fattening, but...

If I want to diet and live slim, do I have to eat a diet plan for the rest of my life?

No, that's not the case.

Of course, if you only eat food like that continuously, it could become a problem.

If you make your body healthy through dieting, occasional indulgences may not be a problem.

I previously made a response video for the same question.
