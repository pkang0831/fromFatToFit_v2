Among the questions that came up in the comments, there were many about liking foods that make you gain weight.

For example, to lose weight, I need to stop eating bread.

I love bread so much that just the act of dieting is difficult.

Even if you work hard and succeed in your diet, there are people who say they experience a yo-yo effect after eating bread.

Although the example was about bread, there were many comments suggesting that other foods would be better.

Some people experienced stress because they liked foods that make them gain weight, but

Some people have called themselves cursed for liking such food.

In this video, I will talk about the reasons why I came to like such foods and the solutions to that.

Everyone has different tastes, so the foods they like and dislike vary.

Some people like foods that make them gain weight, but there are also those who do not.

Why does this difference occur?

It's because everyone is in a different environment.

Statistically, if parents are obese, the likelihood of their children being obese is high.

The reason for this is partly due to genetic factors, but the influence of the environment is also quite significant.

In the case of children, they eat the food provided by their parents for over 10 years, so they naturally share their parents' eating habits.

If parents like and frequently eat unhealthy foods, and as a result, they are obese.

Children who share their parents' eating habits also tend to eat fatty foods frequently and become obese.

And if you frequently eat foods that make you gain weight from a young age, you develop a tendency to prefer them because they become familiar and comfortable.

The food I currently love that makes me gain weight is something I had never tried when I was young.

It's not a story about a specific food, but rather a discussion about types of food.

For example, if you grew up eating a lot of processed foods,

Even if it's not the exact same product, it means that people tend to prefer processed foods.

The preference mentioned here means that it is something that is eaten frequently, regardless of the reason.

There are also cases where people feel that processed foods taste better than what they make themselves with purchased ingredients, leading them to eat processed foods more often.

Making food from scratch with fresh ingredients is tastier, but I often eat processed foods because I'm used to them and they are convenient.

As I always say, no matter how fattening a food is, you don't become obese just by eating it once.

Over a long period of time, consistently eating a lot leads to an increase in body fat, resulting in obesity.

Can the taste for fattening foods not be changed?

No, it can be changed.

I briefly talked about changing one's taste in other videos.

My taste can change depending on the food I eat or my physical condition.

For example, if you follow a low-sodium diet for an extended period for weight loss,

People often come to dislike salty foods because they become sensitive to saltiness.

When you follow a diet that severely restricts carbohydrates, your cravings for carbohydrate-rich foods may increase.

An example of how taste changes according to the condition of the body is the change in taste that occurs as one ages.

There is a saying often shared among middle-aged people that as you get older, you start to appreciate the taste of vegetables more.

When I was young, I didn't really like namul, so I didn't eat it much.

As I get older, I find vegetables more delicious, so I intentionally seek them out more.

As I got older, I became deficient in vitamins and minerals, and as a result, my craving for greens increased.

So, what foods are consumed in the diet, and how does exercise change the condition of the body?

This means that depending on how I do these two things, there will be changes in my preferred food.

To lose weight, one must follow a diet and exercise. No one is unaware of this.

However, many people often think that the only purpose of diet and exercise is to reduce body fat.

Of course, there is also the goal of reducing body fat.

I have the goal of changing the food I eat through my diet and improving my body's condition through exercise.

Changing the food I eat and the condition of my body means altering my tendency to prefer foods that make me gain weight.

This way, it will be easier to continue dieting without the risk of gaining weight back.

However, many people mistakenly believe that the sole purpose of diet and exercise is just to reduce body fat.

I try to make my diet as extreme as possible or to make my workouts as difficult as possible.

There is no need for that.

So, I have covered this in several videos.

There is no need to be too extreme with your diet. There is no need to make exercise too difficult.

They keep saying to do it according to your own body.

In summary, if you consistently maintain a proper diet and exercise,

The taste for foods that make you gain weight naturally changes over time.

I hope you don't worry too much about that part.

I have been consistently following a diet and exercise routine for over a year now, but I still really like bread and cake.

Why am I like this?

In this case, it may be due to the memories associated with food rather than the nutrients my body needs or the taste of the food.

In the next video, let's talk about memories related to food.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not related, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making the video.
