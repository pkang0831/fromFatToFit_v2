Drinking alcohol instead of eating rice helps you lose weight - Part 2 of Alcohol and Diet

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video about alcohol and dieting.

In Part 1 of the video, it is explained that the calories from alcohol are not stored as body fat.

We talked about why alcohol is not good for dieting.

In this video, we will explore how drinking alcohol can lead to weight loss instead of consuming foods with the same calories.

Since the content continues from Part 1, it is better to watch them in order.

For those who haven't watched Part 1 of the video, the link is available in the top right corner.

You can click and view them in order.

First of all, drinking alcohol instead of having a meal with the same calories can actually reduce body fat.

The reason this story came up is due to an experiment regarding alcohol and meal quantity.

While maintaining the same calorie intake, I reduced the amount of food and started consuming alcohol.

The results showed a reduction in body fat.

Simply put, I drank alcohol equivalent to 500 kcal and reduced my food intake by 500 kcal instead.

It means that body fat has decreased.

Why does body fat decrease even though the calorie intake is the same?

As mentioned in Part 1 of the video,

This is because the calories from alcohol do not easily convert into body fat.

The energy that we commonly refer to as basal metabolic rate is

It refers to the energy used by major organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

These organs are constantly moving without resting for even a minute or a second.

Energy is still needed continuously.

If these major organs stop for even a moment, a person cannot survive.

The reason we eat food is to replenish the energy that is consumed in this way.

However, energy is needed at every moment, but food cannot be consumed at every moment.

The body stores some of the food we eat to use during times when we are not eating.

This is the most basic metabolic activity necessary for a person to live.

What we call dieting is

The goal is to increase the amount of body fat that is used rather than stored.

So, the calories obtained from food are used in part where needed and stored in part for later.

I will use it again later if I need it.

The calories obtained from alcohol are not stored and are used up completely.

If there is no immediate need for energy, it means that it will just be wasted.

It mainly escapes through body temperature.

Due to this wasted characteristic, even if you consume the same calories,

If you consume alcohol instead of meals, it results in a reduction of body fat.

Because energy was wasted, it became insufficient, and body fat filled in for that deficiency.

So, is it okay to drink alcohol without any snacks?

No, that's not the case.

The purpose of the experiment mentioned earlier was to investigate the effects of alcohol at the same calorie level.

So, I conducted the experiment using only alcohol.

It is problematic to apply this directly to the alcohol we drink.

In fact, the alcohol we drink contains not only alcohol but also quite a bit of carbohydrates.

For example, beer is made from barley, while wine is made from grapes.

Barley and grapes are both carbohydrate foods.

So, is distilled liquor like soju okay?

Distilled spirits like soju do not fundamentally contain carbohydrates.

However, among soju, there is a type called fruit soju, which has additional carbohydrates added to it.

In such cases, there may be more carbohydrates than beer.

So... fruit soju is not allowed, but plain soju is fine to drink without any snacks, right?

This is not it either.

In the previous experiment, instead of drinking alcohol, the amount of food consumed was reduced.

So it's not that I didn't eat any snacks at the drinking party.

It means that the amount of food consumed for breakfast and lunch has been reduced before having a drinking session.

In that case, on days when I have plans to drink, I either skip breakfast and lunch or eat very little.

What if you eat only a little or not at all when it comes to snacks at a drinking party?

By doing so, even if you drink alcohol, you won't gain weight, or you may even reduce body fat.

But is it realistically possible? That's the question.

If you eat less than usual for breakfast and lunch and then have a drinking session,

Because the stomach is empty, alcohol is absorbed quite quickly.

So there's a saying that drinking on an empty stomach gets you drunk faster.

In the case of alcohol, it increases appetite and reduces self-control.

In the morning and at lunch, I ate less than usual, so I am hungry and have a high appetite.

If alcohol increases your appetite and decreases your self-control,

It's very difficult to drink alcohol without eating any snacks at a drinking gathering.

It is theoretically possible, but in reality, it is very difficult to achieve.

Even if you manage to achieve it with great difficulty, it is not very good for your health.

I’ve seen videos on YouTube that explain how to diet while drinking alcohol.

Is it possible to lose weight by drinking alcohol as shown in those videos?

Yes, it is possible.

In the next video, I will talk about this.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the alcohol and diet series.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
