Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In Part 1 of the video, the types of low-carb, high-fat diets are discussed.

In the second part of the video, we talked about hybrid diets that are created by mixing two different meal plans.

At the end of the second part of the video, a question was raised: "Isn't it enough to just follow a balanced diet for weight loss? Do we really need to stick to a low-carb, high-fat diet?"

In this video, I will talk about that question.

Since the content continues from the first part of the video, it is recommended to watch the previous videos in order.

If you haven't seen the previous video, the playlist link is in the top right corner.

You can click and view them in order.

Is it really necessary to follow a low-carb, high-fat diet?

To answer this question, we need to start by discussing the causes of obesity.

The cause of obesity, no matter what anyone says, is eating too much food.

The cause is eating too much food.

If you reduce the amount of food you eat, you will lose weight and become healthier.

But why do people eat so much food in the first place? This is the problem.

At first, I thought it was because people are not aware of the calories in the food they eat.

So if they display the calories for all foods and tell us how much we should eat,

I thought that people would adjust their eating habits on their own and that the obesity population would decrease.

What was created with this idea is the calorie diet theory and the labeling of food calories.

However, it has been over 10 years since the theory of calorie dieting became popular and the calories in food have been labeled.

The global population of obese individuals is not decreasing and continues to rise.

Knowing that food is high in calories and that eating it will lead to weight gain.

I know that I shouldn't eat that food for my health in order to diet.

The problem is that not being able to resist and eating leads to obesity.

From this point on, people begin to pay attention to why they eat so much food and why they cannot control their appetite.

And through this process, you will learn about refined and unrefined foods.

Food has a natural form that can be obtained from nature.

Food that is close to its original form is called unrefined food, while food that has deviated from its original form through processing is referred to as refined food.

Processed foods allow for easy consumption of many nutrients and have the characteristic of being digested and absorbed very quickly.

On the other hand, unrefined foods are quickly digested and absorbed, but it may be difficult to consume a lot of nutrients.

If you can easily consume a lot of nutrients, it is characterized by slow digestion and absorption.

So when I said that if I absorb 100 nutrients through food, I would become obese,

If unrefined food has a nutrient value of 100, there is a safety mechanism that allows only 50% to be absorbed.

If there is food that is 100% absorbed, there is a safety mechanism that contains 50 units of nutrients.

Because of these safety devices, the amount absorbed by the body is less than 100, so it prevents obesity.

Refined foods have nutrients that are at 100, and at the same time, they are absorbed 100%, which is why they can lead to obesity.

It's complicated, so I don't really understand.

Let me give you an example to make it easier to understand.

In the case of glutinous rice, the carbohydrate content is quite high, making it a food that allows for the easy consumption of a large amount of carbohydrates.

However, since the contents that are high in carbohydrates are structured with a shell surrounding them,

First, you can digest and absorb the contents after removing the husk of the brown rice.

The skin itself has the effect of slowing down digestion.

And the skin contains phytic acid and dietary fiber.

Phytic acid and dietary fiber also have the effect of hindering digestion and absorption.

So, because it has a high carbohydrate content, it's easy to consume a lot of carbohydrates.

There are safety mechanisms such as the skin, phytic acid, and dietary fiber that hinder digestion and absorption.

Secondly, the carbohydrates in fruits have the characteristic of being absorbed very quickly during digestion.

So there is a saying that eating a lot of fruit can lead to obesity.

However, fruits are composed of 80-90% water, which means they have a very low carbohydrate content.

So even if I try to eat a lot of carbohydrates from fruits, it's hard to eat a large amount because I'm full from the water content.

In reality, there are about 8g of carbohydrates in 100g of watermelon.

To obtain 100g of carbohydrates from watermelon, you need to eat 1.25kg of watermelon.

You need to eat 1.25 kg of pure flesh, excluding the skin.

It's not a reasonable amount that can be easily consumed.

So, digestion and absorption are very quick, but...

It has a high moisture content and low carbohydrate content, which serves as a safety mechanism that prevents you from eating large amounts.

Refined foods refer to foods that have had these safety mechanisms removed through processing.

For example, the safety mechanisms of brown rice are the husk and the phytic acid and dietary fiber contained within the husk.

What happens if you remove the skin of glutinous rice?

Since there are no shells, dietary fiber, or phytic acid that hinder digestion and absorption, it will be digested and absorbed quickly.

The high carbohydrate content is problematic because it is also quickly digested and absorbed.

The process of removing the skin of brown rice is called milling, and the food made from this milling is white rice.

So while eating everything else exactly the same,

The reason why simply switching from white rice to brown rice can have a dieting effect is because of this.

The safety mechanism of fruit is to fill the stomach with a large amount of moisture, preventing one from eating too much.

What will happen if we remove this moisture, which is the safety mechanism of the fruit?

Since there is no moisture that prevents me from eating a lot, I can eat a large amount.

The problem arises from eating too many carbohydrates from fruits that are quickly digested and absorbed.

A typical example is dried fruit, which is made by drying fruits.

In reality, the weight of the flesh of a medium-sized banana, excluding the peel, is about 100 grams.

When you dry 100g of banana, it becomes 20g of banana chips. This means that 80% was water.

Eating 10 bananas in one sitting is difficult, but eating 200g of banana chips is not hard.

So eating fresh fruit is not a problem, but eating dried fruit can be an issue.

To summarize, in the case of unrefined foods that are closer to their original form,

There is a safety mechanism that prevents too many nutrients from coming in.

However, there are increasing amounts of processed foods that eliminate these safety devices.

The excessive intake of nutrients from processed foods is a cause of obesity.

As these facts became known, awareness grew regarding the importance of refinement.

From then on, when creating a diet plan,

I started to include the condition that I need to eat unprocessed foods as a basic requirement.

And if you structure your diet with unprocessed foods, it naturally becomes a low-carb, high-fat diet.

You mean that you can still have a low-carb, high-fat diet without specifically eating less carbohydrates or more fats?

In the next video, I will talk about why that is.

There should be two videos on the screen right now. Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not part 4 of the low-carb, high-fat diet series, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
