To diet, you need to change the types of food you eat.

It's something I always say.

However, if you control the calories regardless of what food you eat,

You can avoid gaining weight or be able to diet.

Why do we need to change the types of food we eat?

I received this question.

To put it simply, let's start with the conclusion.

No matter what food you eat, if you control the calories,

It is correct that you can avoid gaining weight or be able to diet.

The question is whether that is possible.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

First, let's read the content of the question.

What Ronka always says is

To diet, you need to change the types of food you eat.

If you look on YouTube,

I eat foods that are easy to gain weight from, but

If you adjust your total calorie intake to be lower than your daily metabolic rate,

There are quite a few videos that claim you won't gain weight.

You eat directly for a set period of time and then get certified with an InBody test at the end.

There really isn't much difference between my actual weight and body fat.

And then I lost weight on a diet plan.

After the diet ends, when you return to the foods you used to eat,

Because I will gain weight again.

To diet, do not change the types of food you eat.

There are claims that you can continue eating the same foods you normally do while just adjusting the calories.

What do you think?

This is a question of this kind.

No one in this world wants to be obese.

Everyone knows that eating food with too many calories leads to weight gain.

However, people eat a lot and gain weight.

No matter what you eat, you can manage your calories, but that's the part that people struggle with.

The people in the video mentioned in the question controlled their calorie intake, right?

Yes, that's right.

However, those people are probably not obese.

Our bodies are regulated through hormones.

When you need food, the ghrelin hormone is released, making you feel hungry.

If you don't need food, the leptin hormone is released, and you feel full.

Insulin hormone stores energy obtained from food, increasing body fat.

The glucagon hormone reduces body fat by using stored energy.

A person with normal hormone metabolism can control their food intake on their own.

When you eat enough food, you can feel full and stop eating.

On the other hand, people with hormonal metabolism issues cannot do this.

It's difficult to control my portion sizes on my own.

In reality, a person who is not obese is

When I feel full while eating, I stop even if there is food left.

A person who is obese

Even when I'm full, I keep eating if there's food left.

This is what causes weight gain in the first place.

So, if you control your calorie intake, you can either avoid gaining weight or lose weight.

It means that a person who can't do that gains weight.

To someone who has gained weight because they couldn't control their calorie intake.

The statement that you can lose weight by controlling your calorie intake is meaningless.

I can't do that in the first place.

If someone can't control their own appetite, isn't that their fault?

Even if I want to eat, I have to hold back.

This is not a matter of willpower.

It's a hormonal issue.

Insulin hormone stores body fat.

The glucagon hormone is said to use body fat.

These two hormones have opposing functions.

When one hormone becomes stronger, the other hormone weakens.

This is where it gets important.

The amount of insulin released varies depending on the type of food consumed.

What happens if you frequently eat foods that cause a lot of insulin to be released?

Insulin will be released frequently and in large amounts.

If insulin is released frequently and in large amounts, body fat increases.

Glucagon becomes harder to produce.

When it becomes difficult for glucagon to utilize body fat,

It also becomes difficult to obtain energy from body fat.

The problem is that organs like the brain, heart, liver, and lungs continuously consume energy.

If you can't obtain energy from body fat, then you need to find energy from outside the body.

A conflict arises here.

If there were no issues with insulin, energy could be obtained from body fat.

When body fat increases, the desire for food decreases.

In fact, a hormone called leptin is released in body fat.

This hormone makes you feel full.

However, right now, due to issues with insulin, it is difficult to obtain energy from body fat.

So you have to eat while ignoring the satiety signals from leptin.

Because of this, my stomach is full, but I still want to eat. It's a strange state to be in.

If this state continues, you will become unable to control your food intake on your own.

To start a diet, you must first solve this problem.

So, I'm suggesting that you change the types of food you eat.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

No matter what you eat, if you control your calories, you can avoid gaining weight or lose weight, but...

A person who can't do that in the first place becomes overweight and obese.

Second

The food I eat affects my hormones.

Because of the food I ate, there are issues with my hormone metabolism.

You may become unable to control your food intake on your own.

Third

To diet, it is important to normalize hormone metabolism.

The first thing you need to do is...

To do that, you need to change the types of food you eat.

I can organize it like this.

So how should I change the types of food I eat?

I explained the principles of dieting in detail before.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

When reading success stories about dieting,

They say that when you eat less, your stomach shrinks, so you feel satisfied with just a little bit of food.

Being satisfied with just a little means you can control your portion size, right?

So... do I need to change the types of food I eat and also reduce the amount I eat?

No, that's not it.

I ate less food, and my stomach has shrunk.

So if your body changes to be satisfied with just a little bit of food,

People who lose weight by following a low-calorie diet or by starving themselves should also experience similar effects.

I ate less food, so my stomach must have shrunk.

Then there shouldn't be any yo-yo effect, but in reality, that's not the case.

It's not the quantity of food you eat that matters, but rather...

The hormonal changes caused by that food are much more important.

There was a similar question that came up before, so I made a detailed explanation video about it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the upper right corner.

After watching pkang's video, I changed the types of food I eat.

I don't know how much I should eat.

If I'm hungry and I start eating, should I stop when the hunger goes away?

Or should I eat until I feel like my stomach is going to burst?

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
