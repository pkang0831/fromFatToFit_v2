This is the fourth video about the reasons why you are not losing weight.

In Part 1 of the video, the diet

In the second part of the video, exercise

In Part 3 of the video, we talked about mental health issues.

In this video, I will talk about issues related to the body.

An example of a bodily issue would be a time when weight increases due to the menstrual cycle.

We are talking about cases where there are issues with sleep or health.

Let's talk about them one by one.

I talked about it in the menstrual diet series.

In the case of women, it depends on the menstrual cycle.

There are times when weight increases and times when it decreases.

The menstrual cycle is divided into the ovulation period, the week before menstruation, the menstruation period, and the week after menstruation.

From the second half of the ovulation period until one week before menstruation,

It is very difficult to stick to a diet because my appetite increases.

However, even if you stick to the diet with difficulty,

There are cases where weight does not decrease or even increases.

Because it stores nutrients and water in the body in preparation for pregnancy.

The secretory glands and blood vessels in the endometrium increase.

This all has the effect of increasing weight.

When the menstrual cycle begins, menstruation starts.

Pain caused by menstrual cramps resulting from that process.

And due to the discomfort from menstruation, the stress is quite severe.

This stress can cause weight gain or prevent weight loss.

The weight gained during menstruation usually drops off within a week after the period ends.

This is why the week after menstruation is referred to as the golden period for women's dieting.

If you are a woman and there are no issues with your diet, exercise, or mental state, but you are not losing weight, then...

Please check if it is a time when your weight may increase due to your menstrual cycle.

If you are not a woman or if it is not a time in your menstrual cycle when you gain weight,

There may be issues with sleep.

Many people focus only on diet and exercise when they are trying to lose weight.

Sleeping is very important for dieting.

As mentioned in the sleep diet series,

If you don't get enough sleep, you may not lose weight or even gain weight instead.

People who suffer from severe insomnia tend to lose weight.

Yes, that's right.

However, while weight may decrease, body fat can increase.

If you don't get enough sleep, cortisol is released.

Cortisol has the effect of forcibly raising blood sugar levels even without eating food.

In that process, it breaks down muscle to raise blood sugar levels.

It will cause muscle loss.

When blood sugar levels rise, insulin is secreted.

Insulin has the effect of increasing body fat.

So if you don't get enough sleep, your muscles decrease and body fat increases.

More than the weight increase due to increasing body fat.

If the weight loss due to muscle loss is greater, then...

Overall weight may decrease.

However, since body fat is increasing, you are gaining weight.

If you are not able to sleep properly due to health issues, you should seek treatment.

A lifestyle that does not include the habit of sleeping regularly.

In that case, you need to improve your lifestyle habits.

If there are no issues with your menstrual cycle and you have no problems sleeping, then...

Lastly, health issues may prevent weight loss.

A typical example is

It's hypothyroidism.

The thyroid gland produces various hormones that regulate the body's metabolism.

When the function of the thyroid decreases, the body's metabolism slows down.

When the body's metabolism slows down, it becomes easier to gain weight.

So I'm adjusting my diet, but I'm either not losing weight or I'm gaining weight.

I get tired easily, but I can't recover, so I feel constantly lethargic.

There are many cases where it is difficult to maintain body temperature, leading to a strong sensitivity to cold.

A swollen area in the neck where the thyroid is located, which protrudes, is a typical symptom.

In fact, it is rare for weight loss not to occur due to this pathological cause.

If there are no issues with your diet, exercise, or mental state, but you are not losing weight,

Visiting a hospital and getting tested is also a good option.

I actually went to the hospital because I wasn't losing weight at all.

It can also be discovered that there is a problem with the thyroid.

When the body's metabolism slows down, it becomes easier to gain weight. It seems like this is talking about body type.

If your metabolism increases, does that mean you become someone who doesn't gain weight?

People who are on a diet all want to have a body type that doesn't gain weight.

The next series will explore what it means to have a body type that doesn't gain weight.

I would like to talk about how that can be achieved.
