People who binge eat on their diet cheat day and those who do not.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

People who need to diet are those who are obese.

Overweight people tend to like foods that make them gain weight and often eat a lot, which is how they became overweight.

To lose weight, you need to reduce foods that make you gain weight.

If I can't eat the food I like and often enjoy, I become quite stressed.

So, while dieting, I sometimes have a cheat day where I eat foods I enjoy.

Even when you are diligently sticking to your diet, you might lose control and binge eat on a cheat day.

Many people give up on their diet because they are not satisfied with just one cheating day.

However, there are people who are completely the opposite.

On cheat day, I had some food I used to love after a long time.

I feel that it tastes worse than I expected, so I don't eat much of it.

It tastes good, but it's too sweet, salty, and rich, so it becomes overwhelming, and that's why I don't eat much of it.

In the past, I needed to eat a lot more to feel satisfied, but now I am satisfied with just a little.

In fact, there are many comments on my video sharing similar experiences.

After seeing this, a question arose about what the difference is between people who binge eat on cheat days and those who do not.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

To put it simply,

Our bodies have a response to recover the energy that has been used under compulsion.

That's what causes the difference.

A typical example is the response that occurs in the body when exposed to a cold environment.

Humans are warm-blooded animals that need to maintain a constant body temperature.

So, a significant amount of energy is being consumed to maintain body temperature.

If a person is exposed to a cold environment,

To maintain body temperature, it will use more energy.

If the energy consumed by the body increases, body fat will decrease.

Then, if exposed to a cold environment, wouldn't it lead to weight loss?

This thought came to me, and so I actually conducted an experiment.

As a result, there were experimental findings that showed body fat decreases when exposed to cold environments.

There has been a lot of talk on TV broadcasts, newspaper articles, and the internet about the idea that you lose weight when it's cold.

However, there hasn't been much talk about this recently.

This is because the body fat that had decreased over time has been restored.

Modern humanity is the descendants of past humanity.

Therefore, we can infer that the characteristics of modern humanity also existed in past humanity.

So, if modern humans experience exposure to cold environments and their body fat decreases,

One could think that ancient humans would have lost body fat when exposed to cold environments.

However, there is quite a significant difference between modern humanity and humanity in the past.

Modern homes have insulation and warm heating systems.

And when going out, I wear thick clothes.

However, past humanity had none of this at all.

So, in the past, humanity had no choice but to be exposed to cold environments for a long period of time when winter came.

In the past, humans living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle found it difficult to obtain food.

So there probably wasn't much body fat stored in the body.

If body fat continued to decrease when exposed to a cold environment, it would have been difficult to survive in winter.

So how did ancient humans survive the winter without dying and leave descendants up to modern times?

This question arose, so I conducted the experiment again.

I increased the duration of exposure to cold environments.

Interestingly, the body fat that had decreased started to increase again over time.

So, by utilizing a cold environment, I forced my body to use body fat.

Although body fat temporarily decreased, over time, the body restored the fat that was used.

Does this phenomenon occur only with body fat used to maintain body temperature?

No, this phenomenon occurs in most situations where there is a demand to use body fat.

There is a saying that you can burn body fat by consuming a lot of calories through exercise.

However, the reduction of body fat does not depend solely on the calories burned through exercise.

In the early stages of starting exercise, body fat does decrease, but...

As time passes, a response to restore it occurs.

After exercising, my appetite has improved, so I tend to eat a lot.

After exercising, I feel weak, so I tend to lie down and rest often.

This kind of reaction is commonly seen when starting an exercise routine.

By increasing the calories consumed or reducing the calories burned through daily activities.

I am trying to compensate for the calories burned through exercise.

And as you continue to exercise consistently, the energy you expend from that exercise gradually decreases.

The daily metabolic rate of people who exercise regularly and those who do not is not significantly different.

We compared the daily metabolic rates of a tribe that actually lives a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and an office worker who sits all day.

The results showed that there was no significant difference, which led to considerable controversy.

If you live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, your activity level would be incredibly high. How could there be no difference?

There was a related question in the past, so I made a related video.

I talked about calories in part 2.

I will make sure to have the video displayed in the top right.

If you're curious about this part, you can click here to see it.

Let's return to the original story.

By exposing the body to a cold environment, it forces the body to use body fat.

By exercising, you force your body to use body fat.

If you eat less food and force your body to use body fat,

Although body fat may temporarily decrease,

As time goes by, it means that you are trying to restore this body fat.

This leads to binge eating on cheat days.

If you reduce the amount of food you eat, you will decrease the energy supplied to your body.

The body will use body fat to replenish the insufficient energy.

This is the basic concept of dieting that many people think of.

However, if you eat so little that you force your body to use body fat,

The body reacts by trying to restore body fat.

Such reactions explode on cheat days, which leads to binge eating.

On the contrary, when someone has a cheat day and does not binge eat,

It's not about forcing the body to use body fat.

Tell me that I don't need to have this much body fat.

I am someone who has made my body shed body fat on its own.

Since the body itself is shedding body fat, there is no response to restore body fat.

That's why you don't binge eat on cheat days.

This is very important in dieting.

So every time I talk about my diet,

I need to change the types of food I'm eating. I'm hungry, and I shouldn't force myself to eat less.

They keep talking about this kind of story.

The reason many people say they have a cheat day but do not binge eat in the comments of my video is...

I understand such content and am applying it to my diet.

If you force the body to use fat, there will be a reaction to restore that fat.

I understand that I need to encourage my body to shed body fat on its own.

Is that possible? What should I do?

The reason why the statement that the body itself sheds body fat is not well understood is

This is because the beliefs we hold to be true often clash with diet information.

Many people find dieting complicated and difficult because of this.

First, you need to solve this.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make a video on the left explaining the principle of how the body itself eliminates body fat.

On the right, I will have a video explaining how to change the food you eat.
