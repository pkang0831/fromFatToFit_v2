Hello, this is pkang.

This is a video responding to a question that was posted in the comments.

Can you tell me about oats?

You didn't specify what you are curious about regarding oats, so it's a bit unclear for me to respond.

Since it was a comment on a video related to Hyunmi and dieting, I think you are asking about oats and dieting.

A total of two videos about oats are scheduled to be produced.

In this video, we will discuss whether oats have special diet effects.

In the second video, we will explore how the method known as the oat diet can negatively impact dieting.

First, let's briefly discuss why oats are good for dieting.

There are several reasons why oats are good for dieting, but the two most representative reasons are as follows.

The first reason is that oats are whole grains with a husk, which means they have a low glycemic index (GI) and cause blood sugar to rise slowly.

It is food that does not raise blood sugar even when eaten in large quantities, and therefore does not lead to obesity.

Secondly, oats contain a component called beta-glucan.

Beta-glucan has the effect of absorbing fat in the body and expelling it outside the body.

According to some research findings, consuming 3g of beta-glucan daily can lower cholesterol levels.

It is said that the risk of heart disease decreases by 23%.

Well then, let's think about it.

High blood sugar is a cause of obesity, but it is not necessarily due to foods that significantly raise blood sugar levels.

Losing body fat is what dieting is about.

Beta-glucan is said to absorb fat in the body and help eliminate it.

One of the problems caused by obesity is the increase in cholesterol levels.

It is said to also lower cholesterol levels.

From this explanation, it seems that oats are a food suitable for dieting.

Just eating oats seems like it would make the weight drop quickly.

It's not such a special dish.

First of all, the statement that oats have a low GI index is true if you consume them as whole grains with the husk.

This is related to how to eat oats, so we will cover it in detail in the next video.

Let's talk in detail about beta-glucan.

Beta-glucan is one of the dietary fibers.

One of the functions of dietary fiber when it enters the body is to absorb surrounding nutrients and help with their excretion.

So, when you eat foods that are high in fat along with foods that contain dietary fiber,

Dietary fiber absorbs some fat and helps in its excretion.

It's not a dramatically large effect, but there is such an effect.

The fact that beta-glucan absorbs and excretes body fat refers to this effect.

It's not a unique ability of beta-glucan; dietary fiber has that ability in general.

Isn't beta-glucan supposed to absorb and excrete body fat, not the fat that is consumed?

The beta-glucan from the oats we consumed is present in the digestive organs, such as the stomach.

Body fat is found within fat cells.

Beta-glucan in the stomach cannot meet with body fat in fat cells.

Because we cannot meet, beta-glucan cannot absorb and excrete body fat.

The reason why such misunderstandings occur is that

Beta-glucan is said to absorb fat in the body and excrete it.

When we commonly hear the term body fat, it's easy to think of body fat.

So it's not a good expression, but they refer to it as body fat.

However, that expression is not completely incorrect.

Because the food we eat stays in the digestive system.

The digestive system is inside our body.

The fat in the food within the digestive system can be referred to as body fat.

However, if the choice of words is intentional to mislead people into misunderstanding it as body fat, then it's not a good action.

Anyway, beta-glucan does not have a special effect of absorbing body fat and excreting it.

It only adsorbs and expels some of the fats from the foods eaten together, while also containing other dietary fibers.

In addition, lowering cholesterol levels and providing long-lasting satiety are also characteristics of dietary fiber.

So, from a diet perspective, beta-glucan does not have any special benefits.

Beta-glucan increases in volume by 25 times when it comes into contact with milk, which is said to provide a great sense of fullness.

Isn't this a unique characteristic of beta-glucan that other dietary fibers do not have?

The fact that beta-glucan expands 25 times in volume when it meets milk is

It is true that it has unique characteristics that other dietary fibers do not have.

However, it doesn't significantly increase in volume to the extent that the feeling of fullness lasts longer.

There is about 3g of beta-glucan in 100g of oats.

So if you eat 100g of oats with milk,

3g of beta-glucan increases to 75g, which is 25 times more.

If you combine the remaining 97g excluding beta-glucan from the oats, it becomes 172g.

So, 100g increases to 172g.

It's not a large volume to provide an enormous sense of fullness.

If you use 100g of oats, that would be the case, right?

However, if you eat a lot of oats, you also consume a lot of beta-glucan, which could increase feelings of fullness, right?

If you consume a lot of beta-glucan, it can happen.

However, beta-glucan has the characteristic of causing abdominal pain and diarrhea.

Eating a lot of beta-glucan for satiety is not really a good choice.

The characteristics that cause abdominal pain and diarrhea can also be used to help resolve constipation.

In the oat milk diet, 10 to 20 grams of oats are actually mixed with milk.

There are many testimonials stating that constipation has been resolved.

However, in the case of people with sensitive digestive systems, they may experience symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea even after consuming that amount.

So, the beta-glucan in 10 to 20 grams of oats is 0.3 to 0.6 grams.

Even with such a small amount, it can resolve constipation, or for those with sensitive digestive systems, it can cause diarrhea.

Consuming a large amount of beta-glucan for satiety can be dangerous.

It's not a very good choice.

I will summarize.

Oats contain a lot of a dietary fiber called beta-glucan.

This beta-glucan has its own unique effects.

However, because it is accompanied by abdominal pain and diarrhea, I cannot eat much.

Consuming only a small amount has minimal effects, so its utility is low.

Aside from beta-glucan, the dietary characteristics of oats include

Whole grains have the characteristics of being high in dietary fiber and having a low GI index.

Oats are not particularly better for dieting.

Therefore, if you like oats, there is no problem with eating them.

I don't like oats, but I don't have to eat them for the sake of dieting.

Sounds plausible, right?

For reference, oats can be a food that has a weight loss effect depending on how they are consumed.

On the contrary, it can also be food that increases weight.

The way to eat oats is very important.

In the next video, I will talk about how to eat oats.
