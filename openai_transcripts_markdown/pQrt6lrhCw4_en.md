I've been working out hard lately, but I've been seeing a lot of comments saying that I'm not losing weight.

I would like to talk about why that is.

Each comment has different stories and questions, but there are common elements that are included.

I am working out so hard and burning a lot of calories, but...

Why isn't the weight loss happening? That's the part.

However, the question itself is in a wrong situation.

In the first place, body fat does not decrease solely based on the calories burned through exercise.

If you burn calories through exercise, your body fat will decrease accordingly.

This idea is based on the calorie diet theory.

We need energy to live and move.

The energy that our body consumes is called calorie expenditure.

Compare the calories consumed with the calories obtained from food.

If the calorie intake is higher than the calories consumed,

Excess energy is stored as body fat, leading to weight gain.

Conversely, if the calories consumed are greater than the calories ingested,

Because the insufficient energy is taken from body fat, weight will be lost.

This is the calorie diet theory.

It's simple, so it's not hard to understand, and it's quite persuasive.

So many people diet according to that theory.

To create a calorie deficit where calorie consumption is less than calorie expenditure,

While keeping the consumption calories the same, reduce the intake calories or

Increase the calorie consumption while keeping the calorie intake the same.

You can reduce your calorie intake while simultaneously increasing your calorie expenditure.

Simply put, eat less or exercise.

It means that you need to eat less while exercising.

In reality, many people diet in these three ways.

The problem is that most of them fail.

Because there is an error in the theory itself from the beginning.

The most basic condition for the calorie diet theory to hold is

It means that you need to be able to maintain a state of calorie deficit continuously.

You lose weight by using body fat to make up for the insufficient calories.

However, this basic condition is not met.

The body responds.

When you are in a calorie deficit, your body will use fat stores to make up for the shortfall.

From the body's perspective, it's okay for now because there is stored body fat.

If this state continues and I end up using all the stored body fat...

After that, there's no choice but to starve to death.

Of course, the current state is something we have intentionally created.

I plan to stop once the diet is over, but...

Our bodies do not know that plan.

So, I try to find a way to address the calorie deficit somehow.

For example, if you follow a low-calorie diet to reduce your calorie intake,

The body tries to lower the calories it consumes to balance with a low-calorie diet.

In this case, since there is no calorie deficit, body fat will no longer decrease.

This applies to people who eat little but do not lose weight.

If I stop the low-calorie diet in this state,

The calories consumed by the body have decreased.

Because the calorie intake from food is increasing.

Excess calories are stored as body fat, leading to weight gain again.

The yo-yo is coming.

In reality, the majority of people who follow a low-calorie diet experience weight regain.

If you eat less or starve yourself to lose weight because of this, you'll experience a yo-yo effect.

It is advising not to lose weight by eating less or by starving yourself.

So, by eating less food, you reduce your calorie intake.

When you put your body in a calorie deficit,

Our body works to resolve that calorie deficit.

It means taking measures to reduce the calories consumed by the body.

In that case, by increasing the calories burned through exercise,

What happens when you put your body in a calorie deficit?

Of course, we will respond.

There are two main ways to respond.

The first is to encourage eating more food.

The goal is to increase calorie intake to achieve balance.

When you actually exercise, your cravings for food become stronger.

So there are many cases where the amount of food consumed increases.

The second is to lower the calories burned through exercise to achieve balance.

Are you saying that you reduce the calories burned through exercise?

Is the calorie consumption decreasing even though I'm doing the same exercise?

How is that possible?

It's possible because the body changes.

Exercising develops the neuromuscular system, increases muscle mass, and strengthens cardiovascular ability.

The reason we exercise is not only for the purpose of dieting, but also...

Through these changes in my body, there is also the goal of becoming healthier.

Now let's think about it.

When we say we do the same exercise,

A person who is new to exercising and a person whose body has developed through consistent exercise.

The calories consumed by these two people cannot be the same.

As I always say, it's natural for the results to change when the conditions change.

A person who has consistently exercised has a body that is more suited for working out.

A body that is more suited for exercise can only be more efficient.

Because it is efficient, you can do more exercise with less energy.

Being able to do more exercise with less energy means that

It means that the energy expended during that exercise has decreased.

In reality, office workers who spend most of their day sitting down

If we compare the daily calorie consumption of a tribe that lives by hunting and gathering,

There isn't much difference.

He analyzed the daily calorie consumption of the Hadza people in Tanzania.

A traditional tribe that lives a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, running more than 10 kilometers every day.

The level of physical activity was tremendous.

I compared it to Westerners who spend most of their time sitting.

However, there was no difference in daily calorie consumption between the Tanzanian tribes and Westerners.

This is the result of using the most accurate cutting-edge method, the dual-labeling technique.

If you think about it based on the calorie diet theory, it doesn't make sense.

A tribe that lives by hunting and gathering is much more active.

So I think I will burn more calories.

However, considering what has been explained so far, it is only natural for things to turn out that way.

Tribes that live a hunting and gathering lifestyle develop their bodies in accordance with that way of life.

So the calories consumed through hunting and gathering decrease.

It's a situation where you have to move your body for a long time.

On the contrary, office workers spend most of their time sitting.

The time spent moving the body is short.

However, since I don't move my body much, it doesn't develop.

So when you move your body, you burn a lot of calories.

The calories burned per hour are low, but moving for a long time...

The calories burned per hour are high, but it's a situation where you move for a short amount of time.

There's no significant difference.

So does that mean that even if I exercise, I won't lose weight?

Is exercise not necessary when dieting?

No, that's not the case.

It was said that when you exercise, your body changes so that the calories burned during that exercise decrease.

The part where the bodies change is important here.

The body fat in our body is largely divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat that is located right next to the internal organs.

They are gathered in one place, and because they are close to the internal organs.

It is a good fat for storing excess energy or supplying energy when it is lacking.

The body fat that is used when there is a calorie deficit is this visceral fat.

The more consistently you exercise, the fewer calories you burn from that exercise.

It means that it is not suitable for reducing visceral fat.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is the fat located beneath the skin.

It is fat that is spread throughout the entire body.

Because it is far from the internal organs and spread throughout the body.

It is fat that is difficult to utilize for energy.

So, it's difficult to lose body fat just by burning calories.

It's fat that is difficult to utilize as energy in the first place.

However, during the process of changing the body through exercise, subcutaneous fat decreases.

It is necessary to exercise in order to reduce body fat.

So, it is true that exercising leads to weight loss?

Well, isn't the content of this video something that doesn't really matter if you don't know it?

I used to think that way.

The reduction of body fat does not solely depend on the calories burned through exercise.

Exercising does help reduce body fat.

I thought that it was enough to just let people know that they need to exercise in some form.

However, problems begin to arise in the way exercise is performed.

For example, let's say there is a person who consistently exercises by walking for one hour every day.

This person's body will develop in accordance with walking exercise.

Once your body has developed sufficiently, in line with walking exercises,

The body will no longer change.

If you want to change your body more, you should increase the intensity of your workouts and run.

However, instead of running,

Many people are increasing the duration of their walking exercise to 2 to 3 hours while maintaining the same activity.

Because you don't realize that as your body develops, the calories you burn decrease.

If you double or triple the time you spend walking for exercise,

I think the calories burned from exercise will increase twofold or threefold.

If the calories burned through exercise double or triple, then I think that much more weight will be lost.

That's not it.

So it's important to know the content of this video.

The purpose of exercising is not to burn calories, but to change my body.

My body changes according to the load placed on it.

To further change your body, you need to gradually increase the load.

This is called progressive overload, and it is the most fundamental principle of exercise.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

If you consistently do the first exercise, your body will change to perform that exercise more efficiently.

Because of this, the calories burned through exercise gradually decrease the more you exercise.

In the process of changing the body, subcutaneous fat decreases, which leads to a reduction in the calories burned during the second exercise.

Exercise itself is helpful for dieting.

If you think that body fat decreases according to the calories burned from the third exercise,

When the moment comes that your body no longer changes, even after exercising.

There are cases where the duration of exercise is increased without raising the intensity of the workout.

The body has already adapted sufficiently to that exercise, and the calories being burned have decreased.

Even if you increase your exercise time, it is difficult to burn enough calories to reduce visceral fat.

Because it is the same intensity of exercise, the body does not change, making it difficult to lose body fat.

The purpose of exercise is not calorie burning.

The change in the body through that exercise should be the goal.

Because my body changes according to the load placed on it.

If you want to change your body more, you need to increase the intensity of your workouts.

I can organize it like this.

If there is a calorie deficit, visceral fat will decrease.

So, exercising means that body fat will be lost, right?

So, if I eat less and exercise, will both visceral fat and subcutaneous fat be lost?

No, that's not the case.

When you eat less and enter a calorie deficit, your body responds accordingly.

If you're not careful, you may experience a yo-yo effect.

So I said not to diet by eating less.

And in order for the body to change through exercise, nutrients are needed.

If you eat little and do not supply nutrients, your body will not change.

It's not about eating less; it's about changing the types of food you eat.

In the diet principle video I made before, I talked about this part in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

In the top left, make sure to display the video on the principles of dieting.

In the top right, I will have a video explaining why you shouldn't exercise while eating less.

I know I need to exercise, but I'm so tired and overwhelmed with work that I don't have time to exercise.

What should someone like me do?

I made a video before on the same question.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
