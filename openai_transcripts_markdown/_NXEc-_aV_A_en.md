Two essential things every woman should know when dieting.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

The simplest way to express dieting is

Don't eat too little or skip meals; instead, follow a proper diet.

I am working out hard.

That way, you will lose weight.

A man's diet can be effectively managed with just this, and there are no particular issues with it.

However, women's dieting is not like that.

Women know that eating less or starving is not good for dieting, but

While dieting, I try to eat less or skip meals.

I know that exercising is good for dieting, but

I am trying to lose weight only through diet without exercising.

Just listening to it sounds really strange, right?

The reason for this strange behavior is that...

This is because there are factors that confuse and hinder women's dieting.

You make strange choices because you're confused.

First menstrual cycle

Women have their menstrual period once a month.

And according to this menstrual cycle, changes occur in the body.

During the menstrual cycle, there is a period when weight and body fat increase.

During this time, even if you work hard on your diet and exercise, you may not lose weight or

On the contrary, weight and body fat may increase.

Of course, as time passes and the menstrual cycle changes,

The weight and body fat are returning to their original state, but...

If you are not familiar with the menstrual cycle,

I worked hard on my diet and exercise, but...

You may think that you haven't lost weight or that you've gained weight.

Then I start to think, is there a problem with the diet method I'm currently following?

In such situations, the most common choice is to reduce the amount of food consumed.

Since I have gained weight and body fat while eating my usual diet,

I realized that my previous diet was too much! So I'm trying to reduce the amount I eat.

The issue is that the increase in weight and body fat is due to changes in the body caused by the menstrual cycle.

It means that there was no problem with the diet.

There was no problem with the diet, but I misunderstood because of my menstrual cycle and reduced the amount I was eating.

However, since menstruation occurs every month, it leads to confusion again the following month.

This repetition causes the diet to become distorted or the amount of food consumed to drastically decrease.

I think low-calorie diets are not good, and even if I try to diet properly,

If you fall into such a trap, there is no way out.

The second type of body fat.

When we talk about dieting, we mention that we need to reduce body fat.

Body fat is mainly divided into two types: visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

In the case of men, body fat primarily accumulates as visceral fat.

In the case of women, body fat primarily accumulates as subcutaneous fat.

The only place in the human body where the internal organs are located is the abdomen.

So when a man gains weight, the visceral fat increases, causing his belly to protrude significantly.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is the fat located beneath the skin and is distributed throughout the body.

So when a woman gains weight, fat accumulates all over her body.

A problem arises here.

Men's visceral fat is concentrated in one area, specifically the abdomen.

When you gain or lose weight, the change is clearly visible.

On the other hand, women are not like that.

Assuming that body fat can be represented in numbers for easier understanding,

A man with 50% body fat who has lost weight to reach 40%.

This 50% body fat is concentrated in the abdomen, so the changes are clearly visible.

It decreased by 10, from 50 to 40.

On the other hand, a woman with 50% body fat

This 50% body fat is distributed throughout the entire body.

For example, if it is divided into 10 for the back, arms, waist, lower abdomen, and thighs,

Even if body fat is reduced from 50 to 40,

The body fat in the back, arms, waist, lower abdomen, and thighs has decreased by 2 each, resulting in a total of 8.

Since it decreased by 2 in each area, the change is minimal.

So it doesn't show much.

So even if you work hard on your diet and actually lose body fat and weight,

It means that changes are not easily noticeable.

Feeling frustrated because of this or

It's hard to see the changes just by looking.

I become obsessed with numbers like weight and body fat percentage from InBody.

This is the problem.

And a body with a lot of body fat, when exercising,

It's not that the fat just disappears right away and you become slimmer.

It goes through a process of becoming thick and then thin.

Many women give up on exercising because of this one instance of gaining weight.

The goal is to lose weight and slim down the body.

Since I've been exercising, my body has become bulkier.

If I know that it thickens once and then becomes thin, I won't give up.

Without knowing that, you can't continue exercising.

I want to ask why this is happening, but...

Men grow muscle faster than women, but even those men do not bulk up easily.

It is a misconception that the blood has thickened temporarily due to exercise.

There are only such stories, and I cannot find a proper answer.

I am a woman, but I find myself confused, wondering if I have a unique body type that easily builds muscle.

I know that exercise is necessary for dieting, but...

I think I can't exercise because I have a unique constitution.

So, because of the menstrual cycle and subcutaneous fat,

Women often find themselves confused while dieting.

So, you end up doing a wrong diet and keep failing.

Many people fall into strange diets.

You need to have a proper understanding of the menstrual cycle and subcutaneous fat.

You can diet correctly without getting confused.

Could you please tell me a bit more about how the body changes according to the menstrual cycle?

I previously made a series of videos discussing the menstrual cycle in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

If you're curious about how and why your body changes during the menstrual cycle, you can click here to find out.

When men accumulate body fat, it tends to accumulate primarily as visceral fat.

It is said that when women accumulate body fat, it tends to accumulate primarily as subcutaneous fat.

Why does that happen?

It's due to the physical differences between men and women.

I talked about it in detail in the subcutaneous fat series I created before.

I will make sure to display the subcutaneous fat series in the top right.

Why do women tend to accumulate body fat primarily as subcutaneous fat?

And how to reduce body fat?

If you're curious about this, you can click to see it.

You mentioned that being obsessed with numbers like weight and body fat percentage from InBody is a problem.

Why is that a problem?

Even if body fat decreases and dieting goes well, weight can still increase.

InBody may have some margin of error from the beginning.

So rather than focusing on the numbers, you should pay attention to how your body is actually changing.

This is called "Nubadi" because it is an InBody that you can see with your eyes.

In the body image series I created before,

The reasons why you shouldn't rely too much on weight and body composition measurements are...

I talked in detail about how to observe the body through the eyes.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

A body with a lot of subcutaneous fat does not immediately become slimmer when exercising.

You mentioned that it gets thicker and then thinner.

Why does that happen?

It's due to the relationship between subcutaneous fat and muscle.

This was also discussed in detail in another video.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
