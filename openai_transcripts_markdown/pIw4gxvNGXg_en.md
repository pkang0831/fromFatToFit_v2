I'm on a diet that isn't low-calorie, but my appetite is out of control, and I end up binge eating.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

A comment about not being able to control appetite has been posted, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the comments.

Even if you maintain a good balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in your diet with unrefined foods,

I keep wanting to eat refined foods, and once I start, I can't stop.

No matter how well I stick to my diet usually, my appetite eventually explodes.

I'm eating to match 1600 kcal, so I'm not lacking in calories either.

I do strength training and cardio exercises every day.

Four years ago, while doing a super restrictive diet, I became someone whose body doesn't lose weight.

Since then, I have developed binge eating disorder.

It is true that I was born with a greater appetite than others.

Since I was young, even when I was full, I continued to eat delicious food, and that has been my lifelong eating habit.

Still, I haven't binge-eaten to this extent.

Trying to break away from the Kia mode, no matter how much I eat unrefined foods according to Ron's theory,

My appetite hasn't returned to normal.

I just ended up binge eating again to the point where I can't move.

I don't really understand what it means to eat moderately like others do.

I want to have a normal appetite.

Please help me. I don't know how many years it's been like this.

This is a comment that says.

To conclude, insufficient meal portions are the cause of binge eating.

I am eating 1600 kcal a day, balancing the ratio of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

Why do you say that the amount of food is insufficient?

Let's do the calculations.

The energy a person consumes in a day is referred to as the daily metabolic rate.

This daily energy expenditure is divided into basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate.

Basal metabolic rate is the energy used by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

The average basal metabolic rate for women is about 1300 kcal.

The active metabolic rate is the energy expended through physical activities.

A person with a typical level of activity has an activity metabolic rate that accounts for about 20-30% of their basal metabolic rate.

Assuming a median value of 25%, the basal metabolic rate is about 325 kcal.

When you combine the basal metabolic rate and the activity metabolic rate, it already exceeds 1600 kcal at 1625 kcal.

Since I do strength training and cardio exercises here every day, the calories burned from exercise are added.

So, the calories burned in a day will be greater than 1600 kcal, calculated as 1625 kcal + a.

The problem is that the calories obtained from food are less than 1600 kcal.

It says that I am eating 1600 kcal a day.

Why is the calorie intake from food not reaching 1600 kcal?

This is because a person cannot absorb 100% of the calories from the food they eat.

A typical example is brown rice and white rice.

When looking at the nutritional components and calories of brown rice and white rice, there isn't much difference.

In the first place, they are both rice.

If the husk remains, it becomes brown rice, and when the husk is removed from brown rice, it becomes white rice.

If we could absorb 100% of the nutrients and calories from the food we eat,

Whether you eat brown rice or white rice, there shouldn't be much of a difference.

Because the nutritional content and calories are similar.

But in reality, it's not like that.

Just by changing white rice to brown rice while eating the same amount, you can experience the effects of dieting.

The skin of brown rice hinders digestion and absorption, which slows down the process.

On the contrary, white rice that has undergone processing to remove the husk is

Since there is no shell that hinders digestion and absorption, the process of digestion and absorption occurs quickly.

Through this processing, the food that is digested and absorbed quickly is called refined food.

Food that is not like that is called unrefined food.

According to the comments, it says that they are eating 1600 kcal a day with unrefined foods.

In this case, the amount absorbed by the body will be less than 1600 kcal.

So, the energy that the body consumes is more than 1600 kcal.

The energy obtained from food becomes less than 1600 kcal.

The energy obtained from food is insufficient compared to the energy consumed.

From the body's perspective, it demands more food, which manifests as hunger.

By forcing yourself to endure that hunger, when you reach your limit, you end up overeating or binge eating.

In another video, it was mentioned that if you eat unrefined foods, you won't feel hungry even after consuming only 600 to 700 kcal.

Eating unrefined foods doesn't mean that you won't feel hungry even if you only consume 600-700 kcal.

If you are satisfied and not hungry after eating only 600 to 700 kcal, then you don't necessarily have to eat more.

This may sound like a pun, but the order is important.

Food that has been processed for quick digestion and absorption is referred to as refined food.

Food that is not like that is referred to as unrefined food.

Refined foods are quickly digested and absorbed, allowing a large amount of nutrients to enter the body in a short period of time.

In this case, the insulin hormone that processes those nutrients is released in large amounts over a short period of time.

Since a lot of nutrients are coming in, insulin is also released in large amounts accordingly.

The insulin hormone itself is an essential hormone for our body, but

When a large amount of insulin is released in a short period of time, it leads to an increase in appetite.

I have eaten enough food and there is no need to eat anymore, but...

This insulin hormone makes you want to eat more food.

This is sometimes referred to as false hunger and sometimes as cravings.

So, to diet, you should reduce refined foods and eat unrefined foods.

It is necessary to eliminate false hunger and cravings and to normalize appetite.

What is important here is that false hunger and cravings disappear, leading to the normalization of appetite.

It means that it's not that the necessary appetite disappears as if you took an appetite suppressant.

When cravings and false hunger disappear, and appetite returns to normal,

Hunger is only felt in situations where food is actually needed.

If you consistently eat according to this hunger,

From the body's perspective, food is continuously supplied whenever it needs it.

There is no need to continue carrying around excess body fat.

From our body's perspective, body fat is a type of emergency food supply.

In a situation where food is supplied externally whenever needed, there is no need to carry emergency food supplies.

When the need for body fat decreases, the body actively starts to use body fat.

When you use body fat to obtain energy,

You will no longer need to obtain that amount of energy from food.

Since there is no need to obtain energy from food, you start to not want to eat.

So, by eating enough and feeling full with unrefined foods, you encourage your body to use body fat.

When the body starts using body fat, then the amount of food intake decreases.

However, when I read the comments, I first started by eating according to 1600 kcal.

As I mentioned at the beginning of the video, this is not a sufficient amount.

It's not enough, so I'm in a situation where I'm constantly getting signals that I'm still hungry, telling me to eat more food.

However, by ignoring that and continuing to force myself to endure,

When the body sends signals that it needs food, it does not receive any food.

It is recognized as a situation where food is scarce.

In such situations, one tends to conserve body fat, which serves as emergency food, as much as possible.

Since I am trying to conserve body fat as much as possible, the energy obtained from body fat is low.

Since the energy obtained from body fat is low, the amount of food needed does not decrease.

If you even have binge eating disorder, you should first focus on restoring your body to a normal state.

If you are eating unrefined foods, do not artificially control your meal portions too much.

You should eat enough to feel sufficiently full.

What should I do if I eat too much?

I didn't eat enough unprocessed foods, so I kept feeling hungry.

I'm in a situation where I'm holding back that hunger, but I've reached my limit and I'm bingeing on processed foods.

It's much better to eat more unprocessed foods than this.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

The first person has signals of hunger and fullness that inform them of the amount of food they need.

Processed foods create cravings and false hunger, making it difficult to trust these signals.

If you reduce the intake of refined foods and focus on unrefined foods for your meals,

The craving for food and false hunger will disappear.

When cravings and false hunger disappear, I can trust the signals from my body.

If I eat according to the third signal of satiety, my body finds stability.

My body needs to find stability so that I can lose weight and control my food intake.

So if you are eating unrefined foods,

You don't need to worry too much about the total daily intake of calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat ratios.

It's not that you can just eat anything.

When my body stabilizes, I will be able to control myself.

In the first place, dieting is something that involves my body, so I need to listen to my body's reactions and what it is telling me.

Ignoring the body's reactions and forcing a specific diet can actually lead to problems.

In reality, I studied hard about the nutrient ratios and daily calorie intake and created a meal plan, but...

I'm in a situation where I'm continuously binge eating while following that diet.

The diet I created doesn't suit my body.

And my body keeps telling me that it doesn't fit.

You must not ignore this.

What exactly are refined foods and unrefined foods?

In the past, while explaining the principles of dieting,

We also talked in detail about how to distinguish between refined and unrefined foods.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

If you are curious about refined and unrefined foods, you can click here to see more.

However, with the method shown in the video, even if you can lose weight from obesity to a normal weight,

Isn't it impossible to be slimmer than a normal weight?

No, that's not the case.

I previously made a detailed explanation video because the same question came up.

I will make sure to display related videos in the upper right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
