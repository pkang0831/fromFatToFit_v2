Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video about creating a set point, as there were questions about it in the comments.

The term "setpoint" is often used with different meanings by different people.

It is usually used to mean "the body has a weight it remembers" and "the body has a weight it aims for."

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about the concept of set point, which refers to the weight that the body remembers.

If you want to watch Part 1 of the video, the link is available in the top right corner.

You can click to see it.

In this video, we will discuss the second meaning of setpoint.

I will talk about the idea that the body has a target weight.

The body has a concept called homeostasis, which is the tendency to maintain its current state.

Due to this homeostasis, a set point for the body's target weight is established.

What this means is

When a person has 10 body fat and 10 muscle, with a total weight of 20.

If this person eats a lot of processed refined foods, their body fat percentage will increase to 20.

With 20 body fat and 10 muscle, the total weight would be 30.

It was possible to support and move a weight of 20 with the muscles of 10.

Just like a person with small and weak muscles cannot exercise with heavy barbells.

The muscles of 10 cannot support and move a weight of 30.

Homeostasis operates here.

Homeostasis is maintained in order to keep the current state of the body that allows it to function.

I am trying to increase my muscle from 10 to 20.

In this case, body fat will be 20 and muscle will be 20, resulting in a total weight of 40.

So when body fat increases, the body changes to adapt to that state.

When the body changes, weight changes as well.

At this point, the body establishes the target weight as the set point.

In this example, a weight of 40 becomes the set point.

So if I increase my body fat by 10, my weight doesn't just increase by exactly 10.

A set point is established in accordance with the increased body fat.

Until that set point, weight will simply increase.

Looking at it this way, the set point and homeostasis may seem very negative.

It is not only applicable when gaining weight, but it also applies when losing weight.

For example, if there is a person with 20% body fat and 20% muscle, with a total weight of 40.

What would happen if this person ate unrefined foods and reduced body fat by 10?

The total weight will be reduced to 30.

The muscle that supported a weight of 40 is now unnecessary in a situation where the weight is 30.

So, it means that the amount of muscle is unnecessarily high compared to body weight.

Originally, it was in a balanced state, but it has changed to a state with more muscle.

The homeostasis that seeks to maintain the current state tries to reduce muscle mass in order to restore balance.

So, I am trying to reduce the muscle from 20 back to 10.

This is the phenomenon I talked about in another video, where losing weight leads to a loss of muscle mass.

If body fat is at 10 and muscle decreases to 10, the total weight will be 20.

Here, 20 will be the set point.

So if I reduce my body fat by 10 through dieting, my weight won't necessarily decrease by exactly 10.

The set point is formed according to the reduced body fat, and until that set point is reached, weight simply decreases.

In this example, let's reduce body fat by 10, which means the weight has decreased by 20.

If you look for diet methods on the internet, you'll find that 1 kg of body fat is equivalent to 7700 kcal.

To lose 3 kg in a month, it is said that you need to have a daily deficit of 770 kcal.

So does that mean this is a wrong story?

Yes, that's right.

Weight is a figure that is influenced by body fat, muscle, and water.

To lose 3 kg of weight, it means that you need to burn 3 kg of body fat.

It is assumed that weight and body fat are the same, but this is a completely incorrect assumption.

Because of stories like this, while following a low-calorie diet,

Many people misunderstand that I am currently on a healthy diet.

In the next video, I will talk about that misunderstanding.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the setpoint part 3 video, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
