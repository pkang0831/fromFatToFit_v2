Hello, this is pkang.

This is the eighth video discussing intermittent fasting.

In Part 1 of the video, the basic principles are discussed.

In the second part of the video, the reasons why it is difficult to stick to fasting times.

In Part 3 of the video, the reason for the claim that you can binge eat if you stick to your fasting hours is discussed.

In the fourth part of the video, it is mentioned that the effective fasting duration can vary depending on the individual.

In part 5 of the video, fasting time and insulin.

In the sixth part of the video, it discusses whether a longer fasting period is more effective.

In the seventh video, we discussed whether the 23:1 intermittent fasting is indeed a form of intermittent fasting.

It seems that the intermittent fasting series will come to an end with this video.

Since the content of the video is all connected, it is recommended to watch them in order starting from the first video.

For those who haven't seen the previous video, the playlist link is available in the top right corner.

By clicking, you can watch the first part of the video in order.

If you have watched Part 7 of the video, you would have understood the issues with intermittent fasting at 23:1.

There are cases where people react with disbelief due to discussions about intermittent fasting and autophagy.

So, let's talk a bit about autophagy and the one meal a day diet.

Autophagy is the process by which aging cells consume themselves.

It talks about the mechanism of recycling it to become healthy cells again.

What is this story about?

The human body is made up of countless cells, and each of these cells has a lifespan.

Cells that have reached the end of their lifespan become senescent cells, and these senescent cells do not function properly.

Eliminate aging cells and fill their void with new healthy cells through cell division.

We are maintaining our youth.

The number of cell divisions in a person is limited.

So the more cell division occurs, the more this number decreases.

Once all the cell division cycles are exhausted, it will no longer be able to produce new cells.

It becomes a situation where we have to continue using aging cells.

In this way, the function of the cells decreases, leading to a decline in the body's functions.

We express this as aging or growing old.

Autophagy is the process by which aging cells consume themselves and recycle their components to become healthy cells again.

The important thing is that this is not something that occurs through cell division.

Because it happens inside the cell.

Aging cells can become healthier, but they have the characteristic of not consuming their cell division count.

So it has the effect of slowing down aging.

By conserving the number of cell divisions, we can transform aging cells into healthy ones.

In 2016, Professor Yoshinori from Japan received the Nobel Prize for this.

Autophagy has the characteristic of being suppressed when too much food is consumed.

Modern people are eating too much food.

Having fasting periods aligns perfectly with the theory of intermittent fasting, which suggests that it leads to better health.

People who practice intermittent fasting are quickly spreading awareness of autophagy in the country.

So that's how the story of autophagy spread widely in the country.

The second one meal a day is

There has been the concept of eating once a day for a long time.

Due to the perception that fasting is not good, it wasn't very popular.

Then, as intermittent fasting, which requires having periods of time without eating, began to gain popularity,

In that case, it's not the concept of fasting by eating only one meal a day.

There is a perception that the fasting period is being extended.

So, the response to eating once a day started to improve.

As Dr. Yoshino Ri's book from Japan became famous, many people started practicing one meal a day.

From here on, it gets a bit interesting.

The person who won the Nobel Prize for autophagy is Yoshinori, and the author of the book recommending one meal a day is also named Yoshinori.

I thought that by eating once a day, autophagy would be activated, and that I would receive a Nobel Prize for it.

There are quite a few articles or videos on the internet that say so.

The person who won the Nobel Prize for autophagy is Professor Yoshinori Ohsumi.

The person who published a book on the one meal a day diet is Dr. Yoshinori Nagumo.

These two people are different individuals, right?

It's a different person, but since the name has the part "Yoshinori" in common, it seems similar.

There are quite a few cases where these two people are mistaken for the same person.

So, the one meal a day and autophagy are becoming famous, influenced by intermittent fasting.

The names of the person who published the book "One Meal a Day" and the person who won the Nobel Prize for autophagy are similar.

As the confusion of mistaking these two people for the same person overlaps,

For anti-aging and health, autophagy needs to be activated.

To activate autophagy, one must eat one meal a day.

Since beginners find it difficult to eat one meal a day, start with the 16:8 intermittent fasting.

Gradually increasing the fasting time to 18:6, 20:4, and 23:1.

Ultimately, the goal should be to have one meal a day.

There are cases where people think of connecting one meal a day, autophagy, and intermittent fasting in this way.

The idea that autophagy is only activated by eating once a day is...

It's an incident that happened due to a misunderstanding caused by similar names.

So, it's not the case that autophagy is only activated by eating one meal a day.

Therefore, it is not necessary to eat one meal a day for anti-aging and health.

The ultimate goal of intermittent fasting is not necessarily to eat one meal a day.

I will summarize.

Intermittent fasting is a method of having fasting periods.

It's a way of eating that reduces the amount of food you used to eat too much and too often to a moderate level.

It is not a low-calorie diet that suggests eating less food is better.

So, the meal time during which you eat is also important, just like the fasting time.

If one does not understand the importance of meal times and excessively extends fasting periods,

There is an issue with the low-calorie diet.

If you want to practice intermittent fasting, I hope you don't forget that the meal time is just as important as the fasting time.

Sounds plausible, right?
