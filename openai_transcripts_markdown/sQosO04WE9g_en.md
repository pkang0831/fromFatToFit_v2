All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

To diet, you need to reduce the intake of foods that cause weight gain.

However, many people struggle with this because they have a taste for foods that make them gain weight.

I want to diet, but I crave foods that make me gain weight.

As mentioned in the first video,

The basic reason for developing such a taste is due to eating habits and lifestyle.

Conversely, if you improve your eating habits and lifestyle, your taste will change.

The desire for foods that make you gain weight decreases.

However, there are times when you still want to eat foods that can make you gain weight, even if you improve your eating and lifestyle habits.

In this case, as mentioned in the second video, it's more about the memory of the food rather than the taste.

In this video, let's talk about how to solve the problem of food memory.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it is better to watch them in order.

I will make sure to put the link to the previous video in the top right.

To solve the problem of food memory, one must understand the differences between imagination and reality.

The easiest way is to record your expectations of how much you are looking forward to eating fattening foods before you actually eat them.

You can record while eating to see if your actual expectations are being met and compare the results.

For example, if you really want to eat chicken,

When I eat chicken, I wonder what flavors I can expect to experience.

If you were to eat it, how much could you eat?

After eating as much as you want, you can record how much satisfaction you feel.

Usually, one expects the chicken to be very crispy and savory.

If I eat it, I expect to enjoy at least one whole piece, or at least half a piece if I can't manage a whole one.

And after eating it all, you feel a pleasant sense of fullness and think that your satisfaction will be high.

However, when you actually eat the chicken, it often turns out to be different.

The batter was not as crispy as I expected.

It's not that it tastes bad, but it's a bit lacking compared to what I expected.

Still, the first few bites are quite tasty, but after eating a few pieces, it just becomes mediocre.

I couldn't eat as much as I thought I would.

The satisfaction felt after eating is often lower than expected.

If that's true, what does it mean for someone who is satisfied on a cheating day?

And when it's cheat day, there are people who give up on their diet because it's just too delicious.

Yes, that's right. Such cases do exist in reality.

However, that is the case when there is a problem with the diet.

In the first video, it was mentioned that taste changes depending on the food I eat and the condition of my body.

A person who didn't eat or like wild greens when they were young

As we age, our bodies become deficient in vitamins and minerals, so we start to enjoy and seek out vegetables that are rich in these nutrients.

If you are following a severely restricted low-calorie diet,

Because of the lack of calories, high-calorie, fattening foods taste delicious.

If you think a low-sodium diet is good for you and are following a very strict low-sodium diet,

Because of the lack of salt, foods that are high in salt taste delicious.

If you are following a diet that severely restricts carbohydrates,

It's because there is a lack of carbohydrates that foods high in carbohydrates, which can make you gain weight, taste delicious.

Extreme diets have the problem of making unhealthy foods taste more appealing in this way.

Due to these issues, it can be difficult to maintain a diet, and many people experience yo-yo dieting.

That's why they advise against extreme diets.

I will make sure to include a link to the series on fattening foods in the upper right corner.

Please refer to the series to understand which foods are problematic.

You can create your diet by avoiding such foods.

So you mean to record before eating and to record while eating, right?

It seems like it would be annoying to record while eating... Can we record after finishing the meal?

It is advisable to record while eating if possible.

Because as time goes by, the likelihood of self-justification increases.

There is a quite interesting experiment.

After going on a blind date with someone who intentionally tried to look unappealing,

If we were to interview someone about how their blind date went, we would likely hear a negative response indicating that it didn't go well.

I intentionally dressed unattractively and acted strangely.

It's difficult because I'm only getting negative responses here. I'm willing to offer additional money, so I'm asking for a positive response.

After dividing the people who accepted this request into Group A and Group B,

Group A was given 50,000 won in cash as a reward for their lies (an additional 50% of the appearance fee was paid).

Group B was given 5,000 won in cash as a reward for their lies (an additional 5% of the participation fee).

They say it was an experiment to observe people's reactions when they were asked to do a fake interview in exchange for money.

And if we conduct the interview again, we get very interesting responses.

Group A, which received 50,000 won as a reward for lying, responds with this kind of answer.

"Right! The person I went on a blind date with was strange."

"The experimental results are coming out too one-sided, so it seems difficult, and I wanted to help."

Group B, having received 5,000 won as a reward for the lie, gives a different answer.

"The person you went on a blind date with was unique, but they had their own charm."

"I was thinking it was okay rather than just changing it for the money, but since you asked me again, I changed it."

So, Group A admits to their lies and talks about how their blind date wasn't great.

Group B says that they did not lie. They are talking about how the person they went on a blind date with was nice.

The reason for this difference is due to the variation in the amount received.

When I was first asked to do a fake interview, they said they would pay me, but they didn't specify the amount.

First, I conducted the interview with lies, and then I received the money.

If the amount of money received at this time is too small at 5,000 won,

It turns out that for just 5,000 won, one ends up selling their conscience and telling lies.

So, I end up rationalizing that I have always thought positively.

So, you promised a reward and then acted wrongly.

If the reward for that behavior is too small,

Because the valid reason for having to act wrongly has disappeared.

That action wasn't wrong. I originally intended to do it that way.

This means that such self-justification occurs.

The important thing is that such self-justification occurs unconsciously.

So, it's not that I actually thought the blind date was bad and lied to others saying it was fine.

Because I am rationalizing to myself.

I distort my own memories to deceive myself.

So, it means that you end up distorting your memories and thinking that the blind date was actually good.

Let's apply the experiments mentioned earlier to dieting.

People who are on a diet try to avoid foods that make them gain weight.

I need to lose weight, but there's the issue that eating foods that make you gain weight leads to gaining weight.

In the first place, dieting is a promise I made to myself not to eat such foods.

So if you eat foods that make you gain weight while on a diet, it feels like a wrong action.

If you can't resist and eat foods that make you gain weight, the reward you expect at that moment is the satisfaction of delicious food.

But what if it doesn't taste as good as I expected?

You broke your promise to me, and you gave up on your diet today.

I ate even knowing that the weight I worked hard to lose might come back.

It's not easy to accept that this is just the level of taste.

So, unconsciously, we distort our memories, making it seem like it was very delicious and very satisfying.

To prevent this, you need to record while eating and be as honest as possible in the recording.

After recording, do you no longer want to eat foods that make you gain weight?

No, that's not the case.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video, we need to recognize the difference between imagination and reality.

This is created through repetition.

So if you want to eat chicken right now, first record your current state.

I am recording while eating chicken.

After doing this, after some time, I will probably want to eat chicken again.

At this time, listen to what was recorded earlier.

As old memories come back to life here.

"Yeah, it wasn't as tasty as I thought." There are people whose desires are controlled like this.

I think the satisfaction might be lower than expected, but there are still times when I feel like I want to eat it.

At this time, record once more before eating, and then record again while eating.

Naturally, the satisfaction is lower than my imagination, and I feel that what I recorded before is indeed correct.

Whenever you want to eat fattening food, repeat this process.

Then, you will come to recognize the difference between imagination and reality, and your desires will gradually diminish.

So, when you follow a proper diet, your taste buds change, and foods that make you gain weight don't taste as good as you might think.

It's because misunderstandings arise from thinking something will be delicious.

Then, on the contrary, diet meals or foods are actually delicious.

Could it be that you are misunderstanding it as being tasteless?

Yes, that's right. In fact, there are quite a few cases like that.

In the next video, we will discuss why diet meals are often tasteless.

I will talk about how to enjoy a diet meal plan deliciously.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.
