I experienced a rebound after my diet, but I'm not losing weight.

Someone working in the fashion industry has reached out for help.

Let's read what the story is about.

I work in the fashion industry, so I have to diet for my whole life.

Accepting that one cannot be completely dry by nature.

I am someone who maintains a weight that is slightly below average.

My last diet was four years ago, and since then I have maintained a size between 44 and 55.

I am 165 cm tall.

My weight fluctuates a bit, but I was maintaining 55 kg.

I haven't been consistent with my diet management.

For the past two years, I have been able to have lunch comfortably, and I have also made plans for dinner and dined out.

I think I was maintaining it through exercise and intermittent fasting.

The problem is that I had to lose weight quickly in the last three months.

It started after I lost weight down to 49kg.

At the end of the diet, there was some irregular bleeding.

I didn't eat a lot just because the diet is over.

I just ate a bit more of the snacks that I usually couldn't eat.

However, I've experienced severe yo-yoing in just a month.

I have gone higher than my original weight, and at this rate, I think I will hit 60 kg.

There is a saying that weight gained quickly can be lost quickly, but it seems that period has already passed.

I started my diet again, but my weight is still going up.

I was wondering if there might be a health issue, so I got a health check-up and also visited the gynecologist.

The health check results have not come out yet, but the gynecologist says I am healthy.

I want to go back to the time when I could maintain 55kg without having to manage my diet separately.

I don't know what to do.

I'm worried that my constitution has changed.

This is a story with that content.

First of all, I haven't written anything about how I did my diet at all.

It is difficult to know what the problem is.

I had to lose weight urgently.

There was abnormal bleeding at the end of the diet.

After finishing my diet, I experienced a rebound.

Looking at this part, it makes me think that they must have been on a low-calorie diet.

In reality, people who have gone on a low-calorie diet and then experienced a yo-yo effect are

There are many cases where people cannot return to their weight before starting the diet.

I understand that I'm on a low-calorie diet and that there might be a yo-yo effect.

In the past, I used to maintain 55kg without making any effort.

But why is it difficult to return to 55kg since the yo-yo effect has occurred?

That part is what I feel the most unfair about.

It is because the metabolic rate has changed due to a low-calorie diet.

Is it because your basal metabolic rate has decreased?

No, that's not it.

The energy a person consumes in a day is divided into three categories: basal, activity, and exercise.

Basal metabolic rate is the energy consumed by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

It is the energy needed for sustaining life.

The active metabolic rate is the energy expended through physical activities.

Exercise metabolic rate is the energy expended during exercise.

It is often said that following a low-calorie diet can lower your basal metabolic rate.

Basal metabolic rate is the energy used by organs necessary for sustaining life.

Basal metabolic rate does not easily decrease.

Long-term low-calorie dieting can lead to a decrease in basal metabolic rate.

In order to protect the basal metabolic rate, other metabolic rates decrease first.

This means that both the basal metabolic rate and the exercise metabolic rate decrease.

In reality, when you follow a low-calorie diet,

I feel weak and have a desire to not move, wanting to just lie down continuously.

This is a phenomenon that occurs when the basal metabolic rate and the exercise metabolic rate decrease.

This is the problem.

Increasing muscle mass through exercise raises the basal metabolic rate.

There is a saying that an increased basal metabolic rate helps prevent yo-yo dieting.

However, in reality, it is not like that.

As mentioned earlier, most of the basal metabolic rate is the energy consumed by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

The energy consumed by muscles accounts for only one-fifth of the basal metabolic rate.

Because the total muscle mass of the body is only 1/5.

When muscle mass increases, the amount of increase in basal metabolic rate is not very significant.

When you actually increase your muscle mass by 1 kg, the increase in your basal metabolic rate is approximately 13 kcal.

The calories are too low to prevent yo-yo dieting.

So, does that mean that even if you increase your muscle mass through exercise, it won't help prevent weight regain?

No, that is not it.

It's not about the calories, but it helps in other ways.

Muscles can store energy in the form of glycogen.

The raw material for making this glycogen is glucose.

A person with a lot of muscle mass has a larger storage capacity for glycogen.

People who have a high level of activity and exercise.

I am someone who continuously consumes glycogen to create extra space in the glycogen storage.

The excess space in this glycogen storage

When food is consumed, it creates an effect that suppresses the rise in blood sugar levels.

When glucose, which raises blood sugar, is converted into glycogen and stored,

That's how much the blood sugar decreases.

Just preventing blood sugar from rising when eating like this is enough.

It helps with dieting.

When you actually eat food and your blood sugar rises.

If you lower your blood sugar by moving your body and using the glucose in your blood as energy, then...

That alone can be enough for weight loss.

A while ago, I walked for 30 minutes after meals for a month.

We also talked about the experiment where 3 kg was lost.

So to summarize,

Before urgently starting a diet, there is no need to manage your meals.

Due to a certain level of exercise and activity, I was able to manage my weight with that.

While quickly dieting with a low-calorie diet, my exercise and activity levels have decreased.

Because the amount of exercise and activity has decreased, it suppresses the rise in blood sugar levels.

When I eat snacks, my blood sugar rises quickly and significantly.

So, the more I eat, the more weight I gain, and after just a month, I experienced a yo-yo effect.

And previously, I was on a low-calorie diet while being active and exercising.

While the level of activity and exercise decreased, I lost weight and ended up dieting.

Currently, the level of activity and exercise has already decreased.

So, the same method won't work for dieting.

So what should I do?

The cause of the problem is the decrease in activity and exercise due to a low-calorie diet.

Do not follow a low-calorie diet; you should eat properly and exercise.

In that way, you need to recover your exercise and activity levels.

You can return to the time when you maintained 55kg without making it difficult to manage your diet.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

However, if you lose weight through exercise, the yo-yo effect occurs when you stop exercising.

They say that once you start exercising, you have to exercise for a lifetime.

I find exercise too bothersome and difficult, so I don't think I can commit to it for a lifetime.

It is important to increase physical activity and exercise through working out.

This is not about having to exercise hard for a lifetime.

My body changes depending on the kind of lifestyle I lead.

In the case of the person featured in this video,

When not on a low-calorie diet,

I was able to maintain a weight of 55 kg without following a specific diet plan.

I have changed my body while following a low-calorie diet.

So now, even if I manage my diet, it has become difficult to reach 55kg.

The same goes for exercise.

When you exercise, your body develops, and as a result, your activity level naturally increases.

There was a question about this before, so I made a detailed explanation video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure that related videos appear in the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click here to see it.

I understand that the low-calorie diet is a problem, so I know I should eat well.

What should I do if I gain weight after eating well?

I feel like I need to control my calories...

Instead of controlling calories, you should change the types of food you eat.

Changing the types of food you eat.

Are you saying that I should eat tasteless diet food after all?

No.

Many people believe that foods that are helpful for dieting will not taste good.

Or you have to eat tasteless food to lose weight.

There is a preconceived notion that...

Changing the types of food you eat does not mean you should eat tasteless food.

This is a very common question, so I have already made a response video for it.

Why there are such prejudices and how one should eat.

The video provided a detailed explanation.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the upper right corner.

Foods that are helpful for dieting don't taste good.

If you have such a preconceived notion, you can click here to see.

The person featured in this video is

Instead of the basal metabolic rate, the activity metabolic rate and exercise metabolic rate have decreased.

So you said that we just need to restore our total daily energy expenditure and exercise energy expenditure.

What should someone do if they have been on a very long low-calorie diet and their basal metabolic rate has decreased?

There is also a video about how long-term low-calorie dieting can lower your basal metabolic rate.

It was based on a story sent by a former flight attendant.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

You mentioned that just walking for 30 minutes after a meal can help with dieting.

Please tell me more about this.

Why walking after a meal helps with weight loss.

And I also made a video about how to walk after a meal.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right corner.
