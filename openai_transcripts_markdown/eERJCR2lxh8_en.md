The topic of this video is how to identify foods that cause weight gain.

Many people ask questions about food in the comments on YouTube.

"This food has Xg of carbohydrates; is it okay to eat?"

"Is this meal plan okay?"

You ask so many questions like this.

The world is vast, there are many types of food, and diets are diverse, and since different foods affect each person’s weight differently,

It is difficult to answer all questions about food.

And I also have a theory about foods that cause weight gain, so I classify foods according to that theory.

Rather than answering about each individual food, I will explain the method of classification.

The basic concept can be understood from the video I made earlier, "Obesity Diet - Reasons for Gaining Weight."

In this video, it was mentioned that reducing refined carbohydrates is the most important thing.

For those who haven't watched the video, there is a link to the video in the top right corner, so you can click on it to watch.

I believe everyone understands that we need to reduce the intake of refined carbohydrates.

However, when I see a certain food

It's hard to distinguish whether a food is refined carbohydrate or not, and whether it's okay to eat it or not.

You can apply the concept of relativity to distinguish between them.

When talking about refined carbohydrates, the most commonly mentioned food is processed foods.

Sugar

Flour

White rice

Sugar is made by extracting juice from sugarcane, filtering it, and then boiling it.

It goes through a very extensive refining process and is 100% sugar, making it the carbohydrate that raises blood sugar the most.

Flour is a carbohydrate made by grinding wheat, and it undergoes a refining process called "grinding."

When comparing these two foods,

Sugar is indeed a refined carbohydrate.

Flour is a less refined carbohydrate than sugar.

Flour is not necessarily an unrefined carbohydrate.

It means that it is relatively less refined compared to sugar.

Flour is made just by grinding wheat.

Sugar is extracted from sugarcane, filtered, and then boiled.

So when we compare these two things,

Sugar becomes refined carbohydrates, while flour becomes relatively unrefined carbohydrates.

If the reference point is set between flour and white rice,

Sugar and flour are refined carbohydrates, while white rice is relatively unrefined carbohydrates.

Although white rice is refined, the original form of the grain remains.

Flour is ground, so the original form of the grain is no longer intact.

When the average is 50, 80 is higher than the average but lower than 100.

This is how the concept of relativity is applied.

Because this concept is applied, the foods that cause weight gain and weight loss differ for each person.

The methods of dieting vary, and there are differences in the foods that are allowed and not allowed in each diet review.

Let me give you an example to make it easier to understand.

For example, a person who often eats snacks, bread, cake, and carbonated drinks made by combining sugar and flour.

In the case of completely cutting out such foods and eating three meals of white rice.

You will experience the weight loss effects of the diet.

"It's not the concept that eating white rice leads to dieting."

As explained earlier, white rice is an unrefined carbohydrate compared to sugar and flour.

It is relatively unrefined carbohydrates.

So, if you eat sugar and flour and then switch to white rice, you are reducing your intake of refined carbohydrates.

That's how the diet effect occurs.

If someone who has lost weight writes a diet review on the internet...

"Dieting is not difficult."

"If you just stop snacking on things like bread, snacks, and cake, you can lose weight even if you eat regular meals (white rice)."

However, when someone who usually doesn't snack and eats regular meals tries to diet...

"I'm not snacking. How should I diet?"

This kind of confusion arises.

If someone like this wants to diet, they should switch from white rice to brown rice.

Foods that are unrefined carbohydrates, such as brown rice, rather than white rice.

Similarly, there is an effect of weight loss.

The post-diet review left by someone who has gone through this diet.

"Just cutting out snacks won't lead to weight loss."

"I succeeded in my diet by switching from white rice to brown rice."

If a person who is eating brown rice wants to diet more,

You should consume more unrefined carbohydrates than brown rice.

The diet reviews left by people who have eaten like this on the internet...

"I completely stopped eating grains," you are saying.

So it's not about losing weight by eating a specific food.

I have gained weight from the food I used to eat.

If you eat unrefined carbohydrates instead of that food, your intake of refined carbohydrates will decrease, leading to weight loss.

That's why there is a difference in foods that help people lose weight and foods that make them gain weight.

There are two reasons why such differences occur among people.

The first reason is that the target weight is different.

Some people say that as long as you are not obese, it's fine.

Even if you have a little belly fat, if your body fat percentage is within the normal range, then no further dieting is necessary.

Some people think that if others start a diet, they should get rid of belly fat and build abs.

There are people here who aim to reduce body fat further to achieve a completely lean physique.

This is why there is a difference due to the varying target weights.

The second reason is that not all people have the same body.

Everyone has different muscle mass, basal metabolic rate, and digestive abilities.

So even if people eat the same food, some lose weight while others gain weight, which creates a difference.

Whether a certain food makes you gain or lose weight is not something you should ask someone else.

You can compare it to the food I used to eat.

You can eat unrefined carbohydrates compared to the foods you were eating before starting your diet.

Reducing refined carbohydrates leads to weight loss.

If you want to lose more weight during a plateau, you can consume more unrefined carbohydrates.

I will respond to two actual YouTube comments.

The rice contains 70g of carbohydrates.

Among drinks, cakes, bread, and fried foods, there is something that has a lower amount of carbohydrates.

Then rice is the worst for dieting.

Is it okay to have drinks, cake, bread, and fried food? This question has come up.

If you think about the content at the beginning of the video, the answer becomes clear.

The rice is made from white rice, and the drinks, cake, bread, and fried foods are made from sugar and flour.

When comparing white rice, flour, and sugar.

Sugar and flour are refined carbohydrates.

White rice is relatively unrefined carbohydrates compared to sugar and flour.

Of course, unrefined carbohydrates like white rice are better for dieting.

The second question is

Is it okay to eat a moderate amount of stew or soup after having multigrain rice? You asked this question.

Before you try eating this, you can compare it with what you have eaten before.

If the mixed grain rice, stew, and soup are in appropriate amounts compared to the food you were originally eating, and if they are unrefined carbohydrates, then it can lead to weight loss.

If it's not unrefined carbohydrates, dieting won't happen or weight will increase.

If you remember that eating in a non-zero way compared to the food you originally ate can lead to weight loss effects,

You can tell whether a certain food will help you lose weight or make you gain weight.

Sounds plausible, right?
