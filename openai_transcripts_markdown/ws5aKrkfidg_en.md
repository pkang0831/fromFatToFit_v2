If processed foods make you gain weight, then I guess I shouldn't eat even a bite?

All videos have subtitles.

Processed foods make us obese, so we need to reduce our intake of processed foods.

It's something I talk about in many videos.

However, a comment with this content has been posted.

Now, I feel stressed about every little thing I put in my mouth.

Processed food is bad, but in the end, you can't live without eating even a single bite, right?

Every time I meet someone, we end up eating out.

I can't bring a packed lunch to the restaurant.

Then what is the point of this complex video about gaining weight from processed foods?

I eat even though I know it will make me gain weight.

It's impossible to live without eating even a single bite of processed food.

That's a true story.

However, it is not necessary to do that.

Many people tend to interpret dieting in an extreme way.

For example, eating a lot of food is a cause of obesity, so one should reduce their meal portions.

When I hear stories like this,

I believe that the more you reduce your meal portions, the better the diet will be.

It's an extreme interpretation of the idea that one should reduce their food intake.

In this case, not eating and starving becomes the most effective diet.

Such thoughts can develop into an obsession that eating food will lead to weight gain, resulting in the belief that one should not eat.

When such obsessions arise, one becomes stressed about the act of eating itself.

When that stress reaches its limit

You can't eat less or starve yourself for a lifetime, so in the end, a person will gain weight and become obese, right?

I feel so hopeless like this.

However, does reducing the amount of food you eat lead to better weight loss?

No.

On the contrary, it can have the opposite effect, resulting in failure to lose weight.

In reality, if you follow a low-calorie diet or starve yourself to lose weight, a hunger response will occur.

When the hunger response occurs, the body becomes more prone to gaining weight.

So, most people who lose weight by following a low-calorie diet or by starving themselves experience a rebound effect.

In the same concept, consuming a lot of processed foods is a cause of obesity.

The statement that we should reduce our intake of processed foods means that...

It means to reduce processed foods, literally.

To diet, you should not eat even a bite of processed food.

The moment you take a bite of processed food, your diet is ruined and you immediately become obese.

This is not that kind of story.

It means to literally line up.

Alright, let's think about it.

Every time I meet someone, we end up eating out.

That's correct.

And at this time, we end up eating processed foods as part of our dining out menu.

This is also correct.

When eating out, I cannot bring and eat a packed lunch by myself.

This is also correct.

But do we meet people every single day and eat out for every meal?

No.

Lunch eaten at work or school  
Meals at home without an appointment

There are plenty of these typical meal times.

You can reduce processed foods consumed during these typical meal times.

When people say that running is good for dieting,

Obesity can cause knee and ankle injuries when running due to the extra weight.

There are times when such stories are told.

If you start to feel pain in your knees or ankles while running, you can switch to walking from that point on.

Once I feel a bit better, I can start running from that point.

If that feels too burdensome, you can start with walking instead of running.

I'm worried that even walking might hurt my knees or ankles.

Then you can ride a stationary bike.

So if you have the mindset to make it happen, there are countless ways to find a solution.

However, with the thought of not doing it.

If you look for reasons why it won't work, reasons why it won't work will keep coming up.

Then you won't be able to do anything.

So I have dinner plans all week.

For dinner, I have no choice but to eat processed food.

But starting from lunch today, I won't eat delivery food or snacks.

I will reduce my intake of processed foods.

By doing this, you can lose weight.

I have dinner plans all week, so I have to eat processed food.

It can't be helped. I guess I'll have to work hard starting next week.

Oh? I have an appointment scheduled for next week. There's nothing I can do about it; I guess I’ll have to work hard starting next month.

Oh? My birthday is next month? I guess there's no helping it; I should have a birthday party and then work hard after that.

I can't do anything like this.

So to summarize,

Many people interpret diet information in an extreme way.

I think that if it's not done thoroughly and perfectly, it has no meaning.

This increases the pressure regarding dieting and causes stress.

However, just because it is not perfect doesn't mean it is ineffective.

Being extreme doesn't necessarily lead to greater effectiveness.

It can actually have the opposite effect.

So, please don't interpret information about dieting too extremely.

If it's not perfect, it has no meaning. I hope you don't think this way.

That's how you can lose weight.

But is it possible to lose weight just by reducing processed foods instead of completely cutting them out?

Of course, you will lose weight according to how much effort you put in.

Just the thought that you can even go on a diet can help you lose weight.

In fact, there are cases where simply changing their mindset has led housekeepers to lose weight.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have a video about House Keeper appear in the top left.

I want to diet without making excuses.

What exactly does it mean to reduce processed foods?

I will make sure to have a video that explains the principles of dieting in detail at the top right.

If you focus and watch, it will be helpful for you.

You mentioned that eating less can lower the basal metabolic rate and make it easier to gain weight.

There is also a saying that eating less does not lower the basal metabolic rate.

Yes, there is such a claim.

I previously received a question in the comments, so I created a detailed video about basal metabolic rate.

I will make sure to display the basal metabolic rate video in the bottom left.
