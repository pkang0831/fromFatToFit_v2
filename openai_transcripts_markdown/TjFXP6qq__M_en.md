Fully Utilizing the Hormone that Burns Body Fat - Glucagon Part 1

A comment was posted asking for information about hormones that burn fat.

In this video, I would like to talk about the hormones that burn fat.

Recently, when looking at diet information, the term "insulin" often comes up.

One of the functions of insulin is to store body fat.

This insulin is sometimes referred to as the obesity hormone or the fat-storing hormone.

The hormone that does the opposite of insulin is glucagon.

Glucagon promotes the burning of body fat.

It's called the diet hormone or the weight loss hormone.

If you use this glucagon effectively, it can be quite helpful for dieting.

How can I increase glucagon?

You need to reduce insulin.

Insulin and glucagon have opposing functions.

When insulin increases, glucagon decreases.

When insulin decreases, glucagon increases.

Glucagon and insulin are influenced by various factors.

It is influenced by the amount of food consumed, the nutrients, and whether the food is processed.

Let's first talk about the portion sizes of the food.

When we eat food and the nutrients from the food are absorbed,

To process that nutrient, insulin levels increase.

When insulin increases, glucagon will decrease in contrast.

If the amount of food consumed is large, more insulin is needed.

Then the glucagon will decrease more.

So I need to reduce the amount of food I eat.

There are two main ways to reduce the amount of food you eat.

The first is to increase the interval between meals.

Using this is what intermittent fasting is about.

Having a fasting period where you intentionally do not eat food.

It is about reducing the time insulin is secreted and increasing the time glucagon is secreted.

In fact, when the experiment was conducted based on a typical meal portion,

Insulin levels dropped sharply between 12 to 24 hours after the meal.

After 24 hours, a slight decrease or a slight increase was observed.

So, is it better to fast for 24 hours every day or to fast for longer than 24 hours?

No, that's not the case.

If we simplify the content so far,

If you don't eat, insulin levels decrease.

When insulin decreases, glucagon increases.

When glucagon increases, body fat decreases.

The longer the fasting period lasts, the more body fat continues to decrease during that time.

You might think like this.

That's not actually the case.

If we lose weight by starving ourselves, our bodies recognize it as a situation where it is difficult to obtain food.

Lowering the basal metabolic rate, which is the energy consumed by the body.

I try not to use the body fat stored in my body.

This is basic knowledge that everyone knows about dieting.

When you don't eat and fast, glucagon is secreted.

When glucagon is secreted, body fat should continue to decrease, but that is not the case.

The reason this happens is that our body does not operate on a single mechanism of insulin and glucagon.

So simply fasting will release glucagon, so fasting for a long time is better for dieting.

It would be problematic if you understand it this way.

A state in which the basal metabolic rate decreases and the body is reluctant to effectively use body fat.

It's called "Kia mode" or "hibernation mode."

It is important to fast only until this is activated.

So both fasting and eating are important.

That's why it's called intermittent fasting.

You should practice intermittent fasting; you can't just fast continuously.

So, the methods presented in intermittent fasting are two: 16:8 and 5:2.

If you want to fast every day, 16:8 is a good option.

It means to fast for 16 hours a day and eat for 8 hours.

If you want to do a 24-hour fast with the 5:2 method, you only need to fast for 24 hours on 2 days of the week.

The remaining 5 days, you should have three meals a day.

If you starve yourself too much, it's not good for your diet, so there are rules like this.

Intermittent fasting is too complicated and difficult. What should I do?

There was a question in the comments before about how to do intermittent fasting.

It was covered in quite a lengthy series in detail.

If you are curious about the details of intermittent fasting,

The series link is available at the top right, so you can click on it to view.

This video will be concluded here.

In the next video, we will explore the second method of reducing food portions, which is about the amount of food consumed in one meal.

In the next video, we will learn about the nutrients and the processing of foods that affect glucagon.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the second part of the glucagon video.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
