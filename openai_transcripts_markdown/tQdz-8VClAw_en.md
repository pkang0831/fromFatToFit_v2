If I eat less because I'm not hungry, will my basal metabolic rate decrease?

The reason we become obese is that we eat too much food.

However, many people think that the reason they eat a lot is due to their own mistakes.

I originally have a big appetite, so I eat a lot of food. That's why I think I became obese.

So either not dieting at all or

Even when dieting, I try to start by refraining from eating food, even if it means enduring hunger.

For these people, dieting is difficult, painful, and challenging.

However, that's not actually the case.

There are specific causes that increase appetite to the point of overeating and becoming obese.

If you resolve the cause, you can restore your appetite to normal.

When appetite returns to normal, the desire to eat a lot of food disappears.

Since there is no desire to eat a lot of food, I end up not eating much.

If you don't eat a lot, you naturally lose weight.

This is the most basic principle of dieting.

What causes an increase in appetite? We discussed how to address that in the appetite series.

The appetite series link is currently available in the top right.

The topic of this video is about the questions that people who have watched that video often ask.

Following what Ronka told me to eat, my appetite has really decreased.

I'm hungry, but instead of just eating less, I'm not really hungry at all, so I have almost no stress.

So it's really great that dieting becomes easier.

I am worried that my basal metabolic rate might be decreasing.

It's said that following a low-calorie diet can lower your basal metabolic rate, making it easier to gain weight.

In reality, the calories I consume in a day are less than my basal metabolic rate.

I'm worried that if I keep eating like this, I might end up with a yo-yo effect later on.

Even if I'm not hungry and don't want to eat, should I still eat at least my basal metabolic rate?

To put it simply, let's start with the conclusion.

In a situation where appetite is normal, you don't have to eat if you're not hungry.

Basal metabolic rate refers to the energy used by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

So it is energy that is consumed every day, even without any activity.

If you eat less than your basal metabolic rate, you will definitely be lacking in energy.

In a situation where appetite is normal, if there is a lack of energy, hunger should arise.

Why is there no hunger?

This is because energy is being obtained from body fat.

Since energy is being obtained from body fat, there is no lack of energy.

Because there is no lack of energy, I don't feel hungry even when I eat less.

Because there is no lack of energy, the basal metabolic rate does not decrease.

Does that mean that even if I eat less, my body fat won't decrease because my basal metabolic rate doesn't drop?

So why is it said that a low-calorie diet decreases the basal metabolic rate?

Being hungry but refraining from eating much food.

Eating less because you are not hungry is completely different.

It's a matter of order.

Due to a lack of energy, a hunger for food arises.

If you ignore this hunger and eat less food,

The body perceives the situation as one where it is difficult to obtain food.

First of all, we do use body fat to supplement the lacking energy, but...

In situations where it is difficult to obtain food, different reactions also arise.

It increases the appetite for food.

Even in situations where it's difficult to obtain food, I make sure to force myself to find some.

The goal is to reduce the energy consumed by the body in order to conserve body fat for use.

So if you force yourself to eat less while enduring hunger,

My appetite has increased, and I sometimes binge eat as a form of reward psychology.

Basal metabolic rate can decrease.

That's why yo-yo dieting happens.

On the other hand, when one is not hungry and eats less food, it is a case of...

I am using body fat to obtain energy, so I am not hungry.

I eat less because I'm not hungry.

There is no energy shortage to begin with.

Since there is no lack of energy, appetite does not increase, and metabolism does not decrease.

At first glance, these two situations both involve eating less food and reducing body fat, but...

What is actually happening in the body is completely different.

You need to be able to understand the difference between these two things.

So how do you make the body use fat first?

You just need to restore your appetite to normal.

The instinct of all living beings, including humans, is survival.

A body with a high amount of body fat is disadvantageous for survival.

A body with a lot of body fat tries to use that body fat on its own.

However, due to other causes that increase appetite mentioned at the beginning of the video,

The problem is that by frequently and excessively eating unnecessary food, you are preventing your body from using fat.

When appetite is normalized, one tends to eat less frequently and in smaller amounts.

In that case, the body will use body fat.

When the body starts using body fat, the feeling of hunger decreases, leading to a reduction in food intake.

Hmm... does that mean this lack of appetite will continue in the future?

No, the condition does not last a lifetime.

The reason I am not hungry right now is that I am getting energy from body fat.

This only applies to the early stages of a diet when there is a lot of body fat.

If you continue to use body fat, the body's body fat will decrease.

When body fat decreases, the body's natural response to reduce body fat will weaken.

In this case, the energy obtained from body fat will decrease.

Because you need to obtain the reduced amount from food.

After a certain amount of body fat has been reduced, you will start to feel hungry.

And as you lose weight through dieting, your activity level naturally increases.

Many people start exercising because they become ambitious about their body shape.

In this case, the energy expended through activities and exercise increases, which in turn raises the amount of food needed.

In this case, the amount of food needed increases, leading to feeling hungry more often and eating a lot again.

Because the energy consumption has also increased.

When you are on a diet, you can eat more food without gaining weight.

In success stories about dieting, there are often claims that you can eat a lot without gaining weight.

You can think of it like this.

I'm still a bit anxious.

I wonder if the amount of food I'm currently eating is too little, causing my basal metabolic rate to decrease.

Is there no way to verify it?

There is.

In the next video, let's find out how to check if the amount of food I'm eating is too little.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the video confirming the low-calorie diet,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
