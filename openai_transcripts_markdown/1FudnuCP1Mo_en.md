Assuming the same height and body type, is the rate of weight loss different when going from 80kg to 60kg compared to going from 60kg to 40kg?

To answer first, assuming the same key and the same body...

The rate of losing weight from 80kg to 60kg and

When comparing the rate of weight loss from 60kg to 40kg,

The rate of weight loss from 80kg to 60kg is a bit faster.

Among those who saw that comment, there may be some who thought, "Why are you asking something so obvious?"

It is well-known diet knowledge that the more you weigh, the faster the weight loss rate.

The person who asked the question probably already knew the answer.

I think you were curious about why there is such a difference in speed.

To interpret that question in detail,

When we commonly talk about dieting, we often think about the calorie diet theory.

The calorie diet theory refers to comparing the intake calories obtained from food with the consumption calories used by my body.

If the caloric intake from food is higher, then...

Excess calories are stored in the body as body fat, leading to obesity.

Conversely, if the calories I consume from food are less than the calories my body uses, then...

The theory is that weight loss occurs because the body draws from body fat to make up for the deficit.

For example, if I am living a lifestyle that is 1,000 kcal short due to my diet and exercise,

1,000 kcal of body fat needs to be reduced.

This should apply equally regardless of whether my weight is 80kg or 60kg.

If applied the same way, there should be no difference in the rate of weight loss.

The question is, why do differences actually arise?

If you think about it this way, it's understandable to have questions.

The reason for the difference in weight loss speed is that the number of calories does not apply uniformly.

First of all, a person cannot absorb 100% of the calories from the food they eat.

Only a certain percentage of the calories from food can be absorbed.

I call this percentage the absorption rate.

Assuming an absorption rate of 90%

Even if you eat 1,000 kcal of food, the calories that enter your body would be 900 kcal, right?

And this absorption rate is not fixed; it changes continuously depending on the situation.

So it's difficult for me to accurately calculate the calories of the food I've eaten.

The energy consumed by my body consists of three components: basal metabolism, activity, and exercise metabolism.

This is also not fixed in value.

It depends on what kind of life I lead and what environment I am in.

Lastly, the third factor is the reduction of body fat due to cell division.

This also varies depending on my weight, so there is a difference.

These three theories are explained in the video about why starving diets are unfair.

All these factors combined create differences in the rate of weight loss.

If you want to understand it really simply,

You can think of it as having an effect of pulling from both sides based on the average weight.

Let's talk about the 80kg, 60kg, and 40kg mentioned in the question.

When 60kg is considered a normal weight, 40kg is classified as underweight, and 80kg is classified as obese.

Since the average weight is 60kg, there is a force trying to return from 80kg to 60kg.

There is a force trying to move from 40kg to 60kg.

In that case, losing weight from 80kg to 60kg is

Because my dieting efforts and this strength combine, losing weight is relatively easy.

On the contrary, losing weight from 60kg to 40kg is

It's harder because you have to overcome the force trying to return from 40kg to 60kg.

If our body has a tendency to return to normal when it is obese, then why is dieting so difficult?

It's not that it's absolutely easy; it's a relative concept.

Losing weight from 80kg to 60kg is not easy. Dieting is difficult, isn't it?

However, it means that it is easier to lose weight from 60kg to 40kg.

And the reason why such differences arise is that

It's because the body tends to aim for an average weight of 60 kg.

So if you want to go from being overweight to a normal weight, it is sufficient to switch from refined foods to unrefined foods.

However, if you want to go from a normal weight to underweight, it means that additional effort is required.

Sounds plausible, right?
