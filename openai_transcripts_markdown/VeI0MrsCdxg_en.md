I want to break free from the vicious cycle of extreme dieting and yo-yo effects.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

A person who practices ballet has posted a story asking for help in the comments.

Just by looking at these images on the internet,

You can tell how thin a ballerina should be.

In this video, I will read a story and share some helpful insights.

I have been specializing in ballet since I was 8 years old, for a total of 16 years.

I hear that you are preparing for an audition to join a ballet company.

I am a woman, and I have been since I was in the second year of middle school until now, at the age of 24.

I have tried every diet and even experienced starvation.

They say that the yo-yo effect keeps happening.

Then, in March 2021, they said they saw my channel.

I have changed a lot of common knowledge and methods about dieting.

So, they said they moved away from methods like starving or extreme dieting and started to eat well with unrefined foods.

For those who are watching my video for the first time, there may be some who don't know what unrefined food is.

At the end of the video, I will include a link to a video that explains unrefined foods in detail.

Returning to the story...

There were times when I had to eat a sandwich or kimbap because I was busy with lessons, but I did my best as much as I could.

When I'm hungry, I don't hold back like before and eat unrefined foods.

They say they have successfully maintained the weight they lost over 4 to 5 months using that method.

A few months ago, I started feeling a lot of stress from auditions.

Perhaps because of this, my appetite has increased tremendously.

After holding on for a few days, I collapse, and I repeat the cycle of holding on for a few days and then collapsing.

In the end, it seems that you have become a body that craves processed foods.

The concept of refined food is the opposite of unrefined food mentioned earlier.

Processed foods create a problem of false hunger, where you don't actually need food but still want to eat.

This false hunger has been said to be a cause of obesity.

Eating processed foods makes me continue to eat out of habit, even when I'm not hungry.

I ate late at night and went to bed without digesting it.

They say that after repeating that, they eventually experienced a yo-yo effect.

To endure the extensive practice of ballet, one needs to have muscle.

In ballet, being slender is beautiful, light, and noticeable.

It is said that one must first be as thin as a Kia.

So I know that starving diets are not good.

They say that until now, they had no choice but to do it that way.

And I thought that my body type itself is skinny fat and that I have a constitution where it's hard to build muscle.

The reason I came to have such thoughts is

I practice a lot, but my body keeps feeling soft like tofu.

If you practice a lot, which is no different from exercising, you will build muscle.

When you build muscle, your body should become a bit firmer, but that's not the case.

However, after watching the videos on my channel and reflecting on my life so far,

They said that they thought it was natural not to gain muscle because they had been constantly starving themselves while on a diet.

Since I couldn't eat properly, I always felt a lack of energy.

They say that when practicing, you forced yourself to practice even while your arms and legs were trembling.

So I make sure to eat unrefined foods, and when I have a lot of practice, I also eat white rice.

I think it would be better to practice while properly supplying energy to the body.

I guess you're worried that you might not be able to maintain a slim body if you do that.

I want to break free from the vicious cycle, so I am writing this with a desperate heart. Please help me.

Let's first sort out the situation.

Fasting diets and extreme calorie restriction diets are being followed.

You watched my video and had meals with unrefined foods without going hungry.

It seems like you have limited your carbohydrate intake a bit.

You have been able to maintain a lean body well for about 4 to 5 months with this diet.

Was there any mention of restricting carbohydrates?

Although there is no direct mention, you can tell from the last part of the story.

When I have a lot of practice, I also eat things like white rice.

I think we should practice while supplying energy to our bodies.

There was a concern about whether a thin body could be maintained.

It means that I haven't eaten something like white rice.

I didn't just eat plain white rice; I probably didn't completely avoid carbohydrates.

Doesn't just not eating white rice limit carbohydrates?

It happens when there is a lot of physical activity.

In the past, it was believed that the cause of obesity was high-calorie fat.

So I tried to reduce my fat intake, but...

Recently, I have been eating a lot of carbohydrates.

It is believed that excessively high blood sugar levels are a cause of obesity.

There is a strong belief that in order to lose weight, one must reduce carbohydrate intake.

However, carbohydrates can raise blood sugar levels, but they are also a source of glycogen, which is the energy for muscles.

In the early stages of dieting when not exercising, even if you reduce carbohydrates to lose weight,

When you start exercising, you need to increase your carbohydrate intake according to your exercise volume.

So I need to balance the carbohydrates my body consumes with the carbohydrates I eat.

If the carbohydrates consumed are insufficient compared to the carbohydrates burned through exercise,

No matter how many grams of carbohydrates you actually consume, in the end, there is a deficiency of carbohydrates.

Therefore, it has the effect of a diet that restricts carbohydrates.

The person asking the question is majoring in ballet and practices a significant amount every day.

This exercise is no different from a workout.

Therefore, since you are consuming a lot of carbohydrates, you need to eat more carbohydrates.

In the first place, when practicing, the muscles lack energy, and the limbs are shaking.

This will obviously be a problem.

Returning to the original topic we were discussing.

After maintaining a diet of unrefined foods with restricted carbohydrates for about 4 to 5 months,

I was very stressed due to the audition.

Because of that stress, I would binge on processed food every few days.

Processed foods disrupt hormone metabolism in the body, creating false hunger.

Because of this false hunger, I kept eating even when I wasn't hungry, which led to yo-yo dieting.

Looking at this part,

I was on a starvation diet and had meals with unrefined foods while restricting carbohydrates, but...

I maintained it well for about 4 to 5 months.

So in a situation where carbohydrates are lacking,

Even if you eat unrefined foods, you can still maintain a lean body.

You don't necessarily have to starve yourself or go on extreme diets to lose weight.

This is a situation that has already been confirmed.

After that, I binge-eated due to the stress from the audition, and as a result, I experienced a yo-yo effect.

If we think simply, the cause of the yo-yo effect seems to be the stress from the audition.

That's not the case.

For example, if the work at your job does not match your aptitude,

So while working, I was continuously accumulating stress.

If you quit your job due to explosive stress from trouble with your boss in such a situation,

Troubles with a boss at work are merely the trigger for an explosion of stress.

The real reason is that the job doesn't match my aptitude, which has led to accumulated stress.

In the first place, there are very few cases where someone explodes with anger immediately after being stressed by an event.

In the same context, the stress caused by the audition is just the trigger for the explosion.

There is another cause that led to the buildup of stress before that.

What is the cause of that?

It's ballet practice.

I'm shaking because I'm not eating enough food.

In such a situation, gritting your teeth and forcing yourself to continue practicing is

Of course, it puts an enormous amount of stress on the body.

It means that you did this every day.

If you keep putting your body in a situation of constant stress, it will inevitably explode at some point.

Even if there hadn't been an audition, it would have exploded for other reasons.

You should definitely eat unrefined foods, and you also need to consume carbohydrates necessary for exercise.

However, it was possible to maintain it while eating unrefined foods and restricting carbohydrates, right?

So, if I eat carbohydrates here, won't I gain weight?

No, that's not the case.

The principle behind gaining weight from carbohydrates is due to blood sugar and insulin.

The carbohydrates I eat are converted into glucose.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is called blood sugar.

When I eat a lot of carbohydrates,

As the glucose in the blood increases too much, the blood sugar level rises excessively.

If blood sugar levels rise too high, insulin is released in excess to lower the blood sugar.

However, this insulin is a hormone that increases body fat.

When too much insulin is produced, it leads to an increase in body fat, resulting in obesity.

So, as long as your blood sugar doesn't rise too high, it's okay to eat carbohydrates.

What should I do to eat carbohydrates without raising my blood sugar?

There are various methods.

The most representative method is to exercise and increase muscle mass.

When you exercise, the glycogen stored in your muscles is consumed.

The raw material for making glycogen is glucose.

So, if I usually exercise and deplete the glycogen in my muscles,

Glucose in the blood is converted into glycogen and stored.

That much will lower the blood sugar.

When blood sugar levels drop, insulin is produced less, and as a result, weight gain is reduced.

And when you increase your muscle mass through exercise, the total amount of glycogen you can store also increases.

Because of this, I am building muscle through exercise.

Consistent exercise helps prevent the yo-yo effect.

The questioner is doing quite a lot of exercise through daily ballet practice, and

Therefore, even if you eat more carbohydrates, it won't cause any problems.

If you still feel uneasy, you can also try other methods alongside it.

For example, there are ways to use vinegar to prevent blood sugar from rising.

There is a way to prevent blood sugar from rising by engaging in light activities after meals.

And because of the binge eating due to stress from practice and auditions,

There can be a negative perception of stress.

Having a negative perception of stress can be problematic.

In a moment, four videos will appear on the screen.

In the top left, there is vinegar.

In the upper right, there is post-meal exercise.

In the bottom left, there are refined foods and unrefined foods.

I will make sure to display a video about stress in the bottom right corner.

You can choose and watch the video you need from the four available videos.
