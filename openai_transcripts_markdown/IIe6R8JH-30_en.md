The reason blood sugar spikes after the first meal following intermittent fasting.

All videos have subtitles.

A question has come up regarding blood sugar levels after the first meal following intermittent fasting, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the content of the question.

I've watched the entire intermittent fasting series, but I still have some questions.

The PT teacher...

If you don't eat clean after intermittent fasting,

Rather, there is a spike in blood sugar.

I've heard that if this continues for a long time, it can lead to diabetes. Is that true?

I learned that intermittent fasting increases fasting time and lowers insulin resistance.

On the one hand, when you eat your first meal after fasting,

I understand that a spike in blood sugar induces a rapid release of insulin.

How should we understand the relationship between these two?

These are two questions, so let's discuss them in detail.

First, let's briefly go over what insulin resistance is.

The carbohydrates we eat are converted into glucose in the body.

This glucose moves through the blood.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is called blood sugar.

If you eat a lot of carbohydrates, the glucose in your blood will increase.

Blood sugar levels are rising.

If high blood sugar levels are maintained, inflammation occurs in the blood vessel walls.

Our body tries to lower the elevated blood sugar levels again.

The hormone that does that job is insulin.

Insulin stores glucose in the blood as glycogen and body fat.

In this case, the amount of glucose in the blood decreases.

When the amount of glucose in the blood decreases, blood sugar levels drop.

However, if you eat carbohydrates that quickly and significantly raise your blood sugar too often,

Blood sugar levels keep rising and falling repeatedly.

In this way, the response to insulin gradually weakens.

Even with insulin, blood sugar doesn't decrease well.

This is called insulin resistance because it resists insulin.

When insulin resistance occurs, more insulin is needed to perform the same tasks.

The more insulin is released, the worse it is for dieting.

To lose weight, it is necessary to improve insulin resistance.

Intermittent fasting is a dietary method that involves intentionally having periods of fasting during which no food is consumed.

This helps improve insulin resistance.

Let's remember what we've discussed so far and read the story again.

If you don't eat clean after intermittent fasting,

Rather, there is a spike in blood sugar.

They say that if this continues for a long time, diabetes can develop. Is that true?

This is the first question.

It's generally a correct story.

The clean foods mentioned in the question refer to foods that raise blood sugar levels more slowly.

For example, foods like potatoes, sweet potatoes, and brown rice.

Not eating clean means consuming foods that quickly and significantly raise blood sugar levels.

For example, there are foods like sugar, flour, and white rice.

Eating such foods will naturally cause a rapid and significant increase in blood sugar levels.

When blood sugar levels rise, insulin is released to lower that blood sugar.

In a situation where insulin resistance is improved, blood sugar levels decrease rapidly.

If blood sugar rises quickly and then drops quickly again,

The change in blood sugar becomes sharp, and this is called a blood sugar spike.

If this blood sugar spike repeats, the risk of developing diabetes increases.

Um... I don't quite understand.

Isn't it good when insulin resistance improves?

If insulin resistance has improved, why is the risk of developing diabetes increasing?

The weakening of the response to insulin is called insulin resistance.

Improvement in insulin resistance means that the body responds sensitively to insulin.

One of the functions of insulin is to lower blood sugar levels.

If you respond sensitively to insulin, your blood sugar will naturally decrease quickly.

The reason for blood sugar spikes is not because blood sugar drops quickly.

The cause is that blood sugar rises quickly and significantly.

When blood sugar levels rise, if they are not lowered quickly,

This means that the blood sugar level is maintained at a high state.

If this worsens, it will lead to diabetes.

The reason for improving insulin resistance in the first place is...

It is to ensure that blood sugar levels decrease effectively by responding sensitively to insulin.

This is how you can prevent diabetes.

The more sensitive you are to insulin, the more you can lower blood sugar with less insulin.

It's because it helps with dieting.

I have been practicing intermittent fasting, and my insulin resistance has improved.

The risk of developing diabetes is not increasing.

The problem is that I ate foods that quickly and significantly raise blood sugar.

Even if you improve insulin resistance through intermittent fasting,

Eating foods that quickly and significantly raise blood sugar can cause another blood sugar spike.

If this continues, it can lead to a loss of blood sugar control, which may result in diabetes.

Second question.

I learned that intermittent fasting increases fasting time and lowers insulin resistance.

When the fasting period is over and you have your first meal,

Blood sugar spikes induce a rapid release of insulin.

How should we understand the relationship between these two?

This is similar too.

When insulin resistance increases, the body does not respond well to insulin.

Doing the same work requires more insulin.

So, when insulin resistance decreases, the amount of insulin produced will also decrease.

However, it means that the amount of insulin decreases.

Even if blood sugar spikes, it doesn't mean that insulin isn't being released.

When blood sugar spikes, it is natural for insulin to be released in large amounts to lower it.

In the first place, when blood sugar levels are soaring, insulin is produced in small amounts.

So if you can't lower your blood sugar, that's the problem.

I keep saying that if you can't lower elevated blood sugar, it becomes diabetes.

I didn't eat foods that would raise my blood sugar significantly.

There are cases where blood sugar spikes and a lot of insulin is released.

Why is that?

Most of it is a temporary phenomenon.

If you repeatedly eat foods that quickly and significantly raise your blood sugar levels for a long time,

Our bodies can be deceived into thinking that it is something natural.

One of the reasons insulin resistance occurs is because of this.

In this state, if you have a fasting period without eating, your body gets confused.

I have become accustomed to situations where my blood sugar frequently rises significantly.

Suddenly, food is not coming in, and my blood sugar is rising.

So, the body can experience stress and sometimes raises blood sugar levels on its own.

How can blood sugar levels rise without eating food?

Some of the carbohydrates we consume are stored as glycogen.

It is also possible to raise blood sugar levels with this glycogen.

It is also possible to break down muscle protein to produce sugar.

When our body experiences stress, a hormone called cortisol is released.

One of the effects of cortisol is to increase blood sugar by utilizing glycogen and protein.

It is a temporary reaction that occurs until the body adapts to the changed diet.

Unless you are doing intermittent fasting in a strange way.

As time passes and the body adapts, it will naturally resolve itself.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

One of the functions of insulin is to lower blood sugar levels.

The response to this insulin has weakened.

When blood sugar does not decrease well, it is referred to as insulin resistance.

Second

Improving insulin resistance through intermittent fasting

It becomes sensitive to insulin, allowing it to effectively lower elevated blood sugar levels.

It means that you can effectively lower elevated blood sugar levels.

Even if you eat foods that quickly and significantly raise blood sugar, it doesn't mean that your blood sugar won't increase.

Therefore, even if intermittent fasting improves insulin resistance,

If you eat foods that quickly and significantly raise your blood sugar,

Blood sugar rises sharply, causing a blood sugar spike.

If this repeats, insulin resistance will develop again, increasing the risk of diabetes.

Third

After having a fasting period with intermittent fasting, during the first meal you eat,

There are cases where blood sugar can rise sharply even without consuming foods that quickly and significantly increase blood sugar levels.

It is a temporary phenomenon that occurs before the body adapts to the changed diet.

Unless you are doing intermittent fasting in a strange way.

After time passes and the body adapts, it will naturally disappear.

I can organize it like this.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

You said it's okay as long as I'm not doing intermittent fasting in a strange way.

What do you mean by doing something strangely?

I am keeping the fasting hours, but...

You are binge eating too much food during meal times.

Setting the fasting time too long and eating too little food.

So while following a low-calorie diet

I am talking about the misconception that I am practicing intermittent fasting.

There have been many questions about intermittent fasting in the past.

I created a series of videos that explain in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top left.

If you are curious about intermittent fasting, you can click here to see more.

Even if intermittent fasting improves insulin resistance,

It means that the ability to lower blood sugar improves.

You said that it doesn't have the effect of preventing blood sugar from rising, right?

So in the end, even with intermittent fasting, you still need to follow a diet plan.

I started intermittent fasting because I heard that I don't have to make my diet too difficult.

Is there a way to lower blood sugar without following a diet?

There are various methods.

One way to use glucose in the blood as energy is to walk after a meal.

There is a way to eat foods that help suppress the rise in blood sugar.

I previously made a video about walking after meals.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right corner.

Foods that help suppress blood sugar levels include vegetables and vinegar.

Many people believe that vegetables are good for dieting because they are low in calories.

Preventing blood sugar spikes is more important than having low calories.

The video about vegetables is in the bottom left.

I will make sure the video about vinegar appears in the bottom right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
