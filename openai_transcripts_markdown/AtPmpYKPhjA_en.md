The topic of this video is about the problems caused by consuming too much fat.

When talking about a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet,

Many people are concerned about the problems caused by consuming too much fat.

In the comments of the video I uploaded,

I have an interest, but I've heard that eating too much fat is not good. Is that okay?

Some people say that if you eat fat endlessly, it's obvious that problems will arise!!

To answer this question first,

Eating too much fat will obviously cause problems.

If you eat fat endlessly, it's obviously not okay.

However, in a normal low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, you can't eat like that.

Before that, my body shows a rejection reaction.

I want to eat meat, and I want to eat fat, but it's not about holding back because I shouldn't eat too much.

If I eat an amount of fat that is unhealthy for my body, I end up not wanting to eat meat and fat anymore.

Many of you may be watching my videos on YouTube.

If you search for "hamburger diet" on YouTube,

Many people are challenging the idea of whether you can lose weight by eating only hamburgers three times a day.

Burgers are delicious, but I don't eat them because I've heard they're not good for dieting.

How great would it be if you could lose weight by eating hamburgers?

However, the reactions of the YouTubers who take on that challenge are generally similar.

At first, enjoy the hamburger because it's delicious.

However, if you keep eating for a day, two days, three days...

They are showing a reaction of saying, "The hamburger is too much, I don't want to eat it, I want to eat something else."

The same goes for a low-carb, high-fat diet.

For those who are encountering this diet for the first time, they might say, "I really love butter and pork belly."

Is it okay to grill 3 or 4 strips of pork belly in butter for each meal? You might be wondering if that's acceptable.

When you actually eat it, at first it tastes delicious and savory, but as you keep eating, it becomes greasy.

I'm gradually losing my appetite for meat. If I don't want to eat it, I just don't have to.

If you force yourself to keep eating, too much fat comes in and problems arise.

If you want to eat meat, you eat it. You might think, who would force themselves to eat something they don't want to?

There are a lot.

If you search the internet for the side effects of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet,

You can see a lot of reviews.

Looking at this review, the story development is similar.

Day one of the diet - the meat is so delicious. I'm happy that I can lose weight even while eating like this.

A few days later - the meat is greasy and hard to eat. I want to stop eating it.

A few days later, I developed red spots and hives on my body, so I went to the hospital. They said my health wasn't good, so I gave up on my diet.

The meat is so delicious, and the fat is so tasty that I just keep eating it.

It's not that having more fat causes problems, but rather...

I don't want to eat meat anymore because it has too much fat.

So it's telling you not to eat from your body.

I have a video titled "Common Mistakes When Following a Low-Carb, High-Fat Diet."

The link is available at the top right, so anyone who wants to see it or hasn't seen it can click on it to view.

In this video, it's because of the belief that eating this diet will lead to weight loss.

It's a mistake to eat a diet when you're not hungry.

It's a mistake not to eat when you're hungry.

I mentioned that it's best to eat when you're hungry and not to eat when you're not hungry.

You made this mistake in the most perfect way.

I'm obsessed with the idea that I need to eat meat to lose weight, so I'm forcing myself to eat it.

If that happens, you will end up consuming too much fat, which can lead to health issues.

To summarize, can I eat as much meat and fat as I want while following a low-carb, high-fat diet?

Yes, you can eat it that way.

What happens if you eat too much?

Before eating too much, I start to lose my appetite for meat and fat.

So if you don't want to eat, you don't have to.

The amount of fat consumed up to this point is not problematic for the body.

You understand, right?
