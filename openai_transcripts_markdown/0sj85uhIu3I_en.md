The most important fact about dieting - Reasons why you're not losing weight, Part 3.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the third video about the reasons why you're not losing weight.

In the first video, when there is an issue with the diet.

In the second video, we talked about cases where there are issues with exercise.

In this video, I would like to talk about mental health issues.

There are various mental health issues.

The biggest problem is impatience.

When you first start a diet, most people experience rapid weight loss.

The reason is that body water decreases.

Starting a diet means that you are currently overweight.

I talked about how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight.

The cause of obesity is processed food.

Being obese now means being someone who eats a lot of processed foods.

Processed foods tend to be high in carbohydrates and sodium.

Because both carbohydrates and sodium have the effect of increasing appetite.

Carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels, which leads to increased insulin secretion.

When insulin is secreted in large amounts, it has the effect of increasing appetite.

As mentioned in the salt series, sodium also has the effect of increasing appetite.

Processed foods are made for the purpose of being sold.

You need to sell a lot of food to increase profits.

Therefore, we have no choice but to include a lot of carbohydrates and sodium to increase appetite.

The problem is that both carbohydrates and sodium have the effect of increasing body water.

When we consume carbohydrates, they are stored in the body in the form of glycogen.

When 1g of glycogen is stored, 3g of water is stored along with it.

If you eat a lot of carbohydrates, your glycogen levels will increase.

The body water content also increases.

In the case of sodium, having too much in our body is not good, and having too little is also not good.

The concentration must always be maintained at a constant level.

Just like adjusting the seasoning by adding water to food that is too salty due to the excessive amount of salt.

When sodium levels in the body increase, the body retains more water to balance the concentration.

So, a person who is obese is someone who has eaten a lot of processed foods.

People who eat processed foods tend to consume a lot of carbohydrates and sodium.

Eating a lot of carbohydrates and sodium increases body fluid.

In the last video, when body water increases,

As the volume of water increases, the body becomes thicker.

It was said that your weight increases by the amount of water weight gained.

By reducing processed foods for dieting, you will consume less carbohydrates and sodium.

Eating less carbohydrates and sodium will reduce body water.

When body water decreases,

As the volume of body water decreases, the body becomes slimmer.

Your weight will decrease by the amount of weight lost due to reduced body water.

However, if you stick to your diet consistently, unnecessary body water will be eliminated.

Once unnecessary body water is lost, changes will no longer appear quickly.

The water weight has all been lost, and now it's time for body fat to be shed.

Body fat doesn't increase quickly, nor does it decrease quickly.

Originally, dieting involves a slow reduction in body fat, and changes in the body also appear gradually.

In the early stages of a diet, changes occur quickly due to a high amount of body water.

In cases where one is unaware of such facts,

The weight that was rapidly decreasing suddenly started to decrease slowly.

A sense of impatience arises.

So I weigh myself ten times a day.

You start to worry about why you're not losing weight and end up feeling stressed.

This will result in a longer exposure to stress, which will further hinder dieting.

I want to lose weight quickly by any means necessary.

Reduce your meal portions further or exercise for a longer duration.

Or am I just cursed with a body that won't lose weight? That's what I start to think.

If you reduce your meal portions too much, it can interfere with your diet, as mentioned in part one.

If you exercise for too long, it can interfere with your diet, as mentioned in part 2.

If I think that I have a cursed constitution and that I can't lose weight,

It interferes with my diet.

Just having the thought that you have a body type that doesn't lose weight can hinder your diet?

Yes, that's right.

In the third part of the Thought Diet,

To those who have the thought, "I can't go on a diet."

There was an experiment where simply telling someone "No, you can go on a diet" led to weight loss.

So just having the thought that you can go on a diet itself is helpful for dieting.

On the contrary, having the thought that you cannot diet is what hinders your dieting efforts.

The third part of the Thought Diet is in the top right corner. The video link is being shared.

If you are curious about that experiment, you can click to see it.

I want to diet slowly. I hope the weight comes off gradually.

No one has such thoughts.

Everyone wants their diet to end quickly.

However, dieting naturally takes time. That's to be expected.

You need to accept this in order to avoid problems with your diet.

In the next video, we will explore the reasons why weight loss is not happening due to issues with the body.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 4 of why fat doesn't come off.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
