Hello, this is pkang.

This is a video responding to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the content of the question.

Based on the criteria of style and physical function health, is bodyweight training better?

Among the videos I created in the early stages, there is one that compares bodyweight exercises and weight training.

The video link is available in the top right corner, so if you're curious, you can click to watch it.

The conclusion of the video is that there are different ways to build muscle, and there is no exercise that is definitively better or worse.

It means that you should choose an exercise that suits your preferences and do it consistently.

In fact, since you can mix two types of exercise, it's not necessary to make a choice.

The answer to this question is the same.

From the perspective of aesthetics and health, there is no significant difference between bodyweight exercises and weight training.

The reason I have such thoughts is because of the preconceived notions about weight training.

In this video, we will discuss this prejudice in detail.

When it comes to aesthetics, bodyweight exercises are better.

The reason I have this thought is due to preconceived notions about muscle size.

The muscles from weight training are large, while the muscles from bodyweight exercises are smaller.

Such prejudices lead to various stories.

The muscles that look great when wearing clothes are commonly referred to as "fashion muscles."

Large muscles can look unattractive when clothed, so rather than focusing on weight training that increases muscle size,

There is also talk that bodyweight exercises for small muscles are good for building fashionable muscles.

On the contrary, small muscles do not show when wearing clothes.

In order for muscles to be visible even over clothing, they need to be large.

The large muscles developed through weight training should be called fashion muscles.

These two arguments are opposing views on what exercises should be done for fashion muscles.

Weight training targets large muscles, while bodyweight exercises focus on smaller muscles. We have the same stance on this.

But when you do weight training, it does lead to the development of large muscles, right? Why is it called a misconception?

A considerable number of people associate weight training with bodybuilding.

So when you search for bodybuilders on the internet, you can easily find pictures.

This is what I think the size of the muscles that can be gained from weight training is.

Or if the goal is to target smaller muscles than that, I believe it can be achieved in a short amount of time.

However, that's not actually the case. This part is a preconceived notion.

Imagine how much your muscles would grow if you were to do weight training right now.

If you can't imagine it well, please pause the video for a moment.

It's also fine to search for bodybuilders on the internet and come after looking at the photos.

This is exactly the kind of photo that can be easily seen.

I will show you a short video now.

Let's compare Kim Jong-kook's body in the video with that of a bodybuilder.

Kim Jong-kook's body is definitely in great shape, but...

The large muscles of weight training that I imagined before watching the video.

There is a difference compared to the muscles of bodybuilders that you see when searching on the internet.

Is Kim Jong-kook's body too muscular, making him look awkward in clothes?

That's not the case.

So, is Kim Jong-kook not doing weight training, or is he possibly doing it lightly?

That's not it either.

If you search for "Kim Jong-kook exercising" on YouTube, you can find a variety of videos.

In the program "MiwooSae," there was a scene showing someone exercising with a 50kg dumbbell.

You can also see someone doing hex squats with 14 plates of 20kg each attached.

The intensity of the exercise itself is very high, and I love exercising to the extent that I work out even when I go on trips.

I have over 10 years of experience in weight training.

So, when you have been consistently exercising at an incredible intensity for over 10 years,

The level of fitness that can be barely reached is that of Kim Jong-kook.

Most people have the preconceived notion that muscles built through weight training are larger.

If you work hard on weight training, you can have a better body than Mr. Kim Joong-guk.

I believe that a body like Kim Jong-kook's can be achieved in a short time through weight training.

So when I do weight training, my muscles get too big, and I don't like big muscles, so I do bodyweight exercises.

Or can I achieve a body like Kim Jong-kook's by working out with weights hard for a year?

Such stories and questions are for those who actually engage in weight training.

It sounds very absurd and frustrating.

I am doing weight training, but my muscles aren't getting that big.

And this prejudice can also lead to the disregard of bodyweight exercises.

I am doing weight training with a preconceived notion.

Seeing that my muscles are not growing as much as I thought they would.

Exercise is indeed difficult. But if weight training is like this...

People think that bodyweight exercises really make your muscles small.

However, while doing bodyweight exercises, I am not just increasing the number of repetitions in the same position.

If you increase the load with increasingly difficult postures, it doesn't work that way.

Of course, as mentioned in the comparison video between weight training and bodyweight exercises.

There are differences in the way muscles grow.

The increase in muscle size in a specific area occurs more quickly with weight training, but...

The difference is not significant.

To summarize, from the perspective of style,

There is no better exercise between weight training and bodyweight training.

So, choose a sport you enjoy and practice it consistently, and anyone can have a great body.

And in fact, it doesn't necessarily have to be shared.

It is best to do both weight training and bodyweight exercises evenly.

Sounds plausible, right?

In the next video, we will look at it from a health perspective.

I will talk about whether bodyweight exercises are better than weight training.
