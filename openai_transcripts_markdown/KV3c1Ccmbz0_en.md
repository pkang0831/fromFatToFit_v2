A question about how to break homeostasis has come up in the comments, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the comments.

I'm curious about how to break homeostasis.

When I go on a diet, I lose about 1 to 2 kg for a short period.

Appetite increases, and I return to my previous weight.

When I lose some weight, my appetite comes back, but when I return to my original weight, I lose my appetite.

Since then, I haven't gained any more weight.

I'm curious if this is related to homeostasis.

This process keeps repeating, so I can't lose weight and only feel exhausted.

I think I'm exercising consistently and maintaining a healthy diet without overdoing it.

I'm so frustrated.

This is a story with that content.

Although I don't directly talk about what diet I followed,

When I see that weight loss leads to increased appetite and a return to the original weight,

It is highly likely that they have been on a diet that reduces their food intake.

So, when you reduce your food intake for dieting, is the reason your appetite increases due to homeostasis?

If that's the case, do we always have to break homeostasis for dieting?

How can one break homeostasis?

You're curious about this part, right?

To conclude, it is true that homeostasis causes an increase in appetite.

However, it is not always necessary to break homeostasis for dieting.

Homeostasis is the characteristic that maintains the internal environment of the body in a stable and constant state.

This is often misunderstood as trying to maintain body fat or weight.

Actually, this part is quite confusing.

Homeostasis strives to maintain a stable and consistent internal environment in the body.

There are cases where body fat and body weight increase or are maintained.

The purpose of homeostasis itself is not just to maintain body fat and body weight.

Let's take an example to make it easier to understand.

When we eat carbohydrates, those carbohydrates are converted into glucose in the body.

This glucose travels through the blood.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is called blood sugar.

When the amount of glucose in the blood increases, blood sugar levels rise.

Homeostasis, which aims to maintain a stable and consistent internal environment, seeks to keep blood sugar levels steady.

So when blood sugar rises, insulin hormone is released to lower the blood sugar.

Insulin lowers blood sugar by storing glucose in the blood as glycogen and body fat.

What will happen if you eat foods that raise blood sugar significantly in this situation?

Blood sugar has increased significantly.

To lower the significantly elevated blood sugar levels, a lot of insulin will likely be released.

When insulin levels are high, body fat also tends to increase significantly.

So the reason why body fat has increased significantly is...

This is because a lot of insulin hormone, which stores body fat, has been released.

The reason for the high levels of insulin hormone is

It's due to homeostasis, which aims to keep blood sugar levels stable.

However, looking at this, homeostasis is the cause of obesity; we gain weight because of homeostasis.

It's hard to say it like this.

Homeostasis was simply trying to keep blood sugar levels stable.

In the process, my body fat inevitably increased.

It's not that homeostasis is the problem.

The problem is eating foods that significantly raise blood sugar levels.

Let's read the content of the story again.

I started a diet by reducing my meal portions, and while my weight is decreasing,

I mentioned that my appetite has increased, so my food intake has gone up again, and I've returned to my original weight.

The reason for the increased appetite here is due to homeostasis.

To maintain a stable and consistent internal environment in the body,

We need to balance the energy supplied and the energy consumed.

If you eat less food, the energy you get from it decreases, and balance is disrupted.

So, in order to maintain energy balance, it encourages an increase in appetite to eat more food.

Even if you increase your appetite, if you hold back and don't eat more food...

Since the supplied energy is not increasing,

We also balance by reducing the energy we consume.

When you lose weight by starving yourself, this is the case where your basal metabolic rate decreases.

In this situation, homeostasis increases appetite or lowers the basal metabolic rate.

The reason for yo-yoing is homeostasis.

To diet without experiencing a yo-yo effect, you must break homeostasis.

You shouldn't think like this.

If you eat foods that significantly raise your blood sugar levels,

The homeostasis that aims to maintain blood sugar levels consistently leads to increased insulin production.

Due to the increased insulin levels, body fat does increase.

The problem in this situation is not homeostasis, but rather...

You mentioned that eating foods that significantly raise blood sugar is the problem.

In the same concept.

If you try to lose weight by reducing your meal portions,

Homeostasis, which aims to maintain energy balance, can increase appetite or decrease basal metabolic rate.

This can cause yo-yo effects, but...

The problem in this situation is not homeostasis, but rather...

The problem is that I tried to diet by reducing my food intake.

If there is no homeostasis in the first place, the body cannot maintain stability.

Because it can lead to death if done incorrectly.

Breaking homeostasis for the sake of dieting doesn't make sense.

To diet, you don't have to break homeostasis; you need to utilize it.

Insulin performs various functions.

One of them was said to be storing body fat.

From the perspective of body fat, insulin is a hormone that increases body fat.

So in situations where a lot of insulin is released, hormones that reduce body fat cannot be produced.

Because it is a hormone that performs opposing functions.

When one side becomes stronger, the opposite side becomes weaker.

This is where it gets important.

When we eat food, insulin is released in the body.

The amount of insulin released varies with each type of food.

If you eat foods that cause a lot of insulin to be released,

Since a lot of insulin is released, which increases body fat, body fat increases significantly.

Since hormones that reduce body fat cannot be produced, energy cannot be obtained from body fat.

If you cannot obtain energy from body fat, you need to get more energy from food.

To get more energy from food, you should eat more often and in larger quantities.

This is the process of eating a lot and becoming obese.

If you consume the same calories,

What would happen if you eat foods that do not cause a lot of insulin to be released?

Since the insulin hormone that increases body fat is not produced in large amounts,

Body fat does not increase significantly, and hormones that help reduce body fat can be released.

When hormones that reduce body fat are released, energy is obtained from body fat.

When the energy obtained from food combines with the energy obtained from body fat,

As the energy supplied to the body increases, the energy balance becomes disrupted.

When energy balance is disrupted, homeostasis intervenes.

Since there is an excess of supplied energy,

By reducing appetite and eating less food, you can decrease the energy supplied.

You try to increase the energy your body consumes to maintain balance.

Your appetite decreases, making you not want to eat food.

It means that the basal metabolic rate increases.

Isn't it fun?

When dieting by eating less food, the homeostasis that was hindering the diet...

It helps with dieting because I don't eat less food.

When I changed the types of food I actually eat, I no longer feel hungry.

So the calories from the food I eat in a day are less than 1,000 kcal.

There are quite a few comments asking if it's okay to eat like this.

In the past, I used to eat a lot and was obese, so I started a diet.

Right now, I'm not hungry, so I'm worried that I'm eating too little.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

The first homeostasis is the characteristic of maintaining the internal environment of the body in a stable and consistent manner.

This is essential for sustaining life.

To diet, you should not try to break homeostasis.

If you want to lose weight by reducing your second meal portion,

Homeostasis increases appetite and lowers basal metabolic rate, leading to weight regain.

The problem in this situation is not homeostasis, but rather the dieting method that involves reducing food intake.

If you diet by changing the types of food without reducing the amount of food you eat for the third meal,

Homeostasis reduces appetite or increases the energy the body consumes.

I will help you with your diet.

It can be organized like this.

To diet, you don't have to break homeostasis; you need to utilize it.

So how should I change the types of food I eat?

What foods reduce insulin production?

Regarding how to change the types of food you eat,

I explained the principles of dieting in detail in the video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

When I decide to diet, I really put in a lot of effort.

After about 2 to 3 months, I get tired and give up.

I keep giving up, and I start to wonder if this is all my willpower can manage, which lowers my self-esteem.

It's hard to start dieting again.

Is there a story that would be helpful for someone like me?

In the past, someone who had the same concern sent in their story, and I made a video responding to it.

I think that video will be helpful for you.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the upper right corner.

If you have similar concerns, you can click to see more.

While studying dieting, I realized that there are really many different methods for dieting.

I heard that I need to find a diet method that suits me among those options.

Why do different people have different effective diet methods?

I previously made a video answering the same question.
