Is it true that you get fat because of the obesity bacteria?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the third video about gut microbiota.

In the first video, it was mentioned that obesity can occur depending on the composition of gut microbiota.

In the second video, we talked about diet probiotics.

In this video, I would like to talk about the "fat bacteria" and "obesity bacteria."

Since the content is continuing from the last video,

It is recommended to watch the videos in order starting from the one at the front.

I will make sure to include the playlist link in the video description and at the top right.

In Korea, Ferminutes is referred to as "fat bacteria" or "obesity bacteria."

The reason it is called this way is due to a paper published in 2006.

The gut microbiota of Americans can be broadly divided into Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.

A study was conducted on 12 obese patients.

While dieting with a low-calorie diet for a year,

I observed how the gut microbiota changes.

The ratio of Fermicutes is gradually decreasing.

The proportion of Bacteroides has been observed to be gradually increasing.

And when comparing obese individuals with non-obese individuals,

It has been observed that individuals with obesity have a higher ratio of Firmicutes compared to those without obesity.

The higher the ratio of fermicutes, the more likely one is to be obese. This leads to such a conclusion.

In Korea, based on the content of this paper,

The secret of obesity has been revealed.

There is a fat bacterium called Firmicutes that makes us obese.

To lose weight, you need to reduce or eliminate this bacteria.

This is how the story spreads.

First of all, because of the terms "fat bacteria" and "obesity bacteria."

There are cases where people misunderstand that "Fermicutes" is the name of a specific bacterium.

Fermicutes is not the name of a specific bacterium, but rather a term that refers to a type of microorganism.

To make it easier to understand, let's take an example: it's like mammals.

Mammals do not refer to a specific animal but rather encompass all animals that nurse their young.

Animals that nurse their young, such as cows, dogs, pigs, and horses, all belong to the classification of mammals.

Humans are mammals because they raise their children by breastfeeding.

Fermicutes is classified as a phylum.

This is a broader concept than mammals.

If you look for the same concept in animals, you will find chordates.

Chordates are animals that have a backbone and a nerve cord that forms the central nervous system.

Most of what we call animals falls under this category.

So, Fermi cuties refer to a very diverse range of microorganisms.

In reality, the number of microorganisms in a person's gut is in the trillions, and the types exceed several hundred.

In the case of Americans, more than 90% of their gut microbiota belongs to either Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes.

It means that it is a broad classification that includes most of the microorganisms in the gut.

In 2006, when that paper was published, research on gut microbiota was in its early stages.

So, I researched microorganisms belonging to the Fermi cuties without classifying them separately.

As time goes by, research on gut microbiota is being conducted.

It has been confirmed that various microorganisms belonging to the Fermi cuties all perform different functions.

Is there really a connection between the Fermi cut-off and obesity? This question arose.

To resolve that question, a meta-analysis was conducted using several papers.

The relationship between obesity and the ratio of Fermicutes has not been proven.

Simply put, there is no relationship between obesity and the ratio of Fermicutes.

So, the term "Fermicutes" being referred to as "fat bacteria" or "obesity bacteria" is fundamentally incorrect.

However, in the previous videos,

You have been saying that an increase in harmful bacteria among gut microorganisms leads to weight gain.

Aren't all Fermicutes harmful bacteria?

Fermicutes is classified from the perspective of species.

Beneficial bacteria and harmful bacteria are classified based on the actual effects that each microorganism has.

So, there are harmful bacteria that belong to the Fermi cuties and have negative effects on the body.

There are beneficial bacteria that provide good effects for the body.

There is actually a bacterium called Faecalibacterium.

This bacterium belongs to the genus Fermicutes from a species perspective, but

It is a beneficial bacteria that provides good effects for the body.

So to summarize,

In Korea, Ferminicutes is referred to as "fat bacteria" or "obesity bacteria."

It is often said that reducing or eliminating this bacteria is necessary for dieting.

In the first place, Fermi's paradox and obesity are unrelated.

The statement "Fermicutes is a fat bacterium" is itself incorrect.

I keep saying that.

What makes us obese is not a specific single bacterium, but rather

This is the composition of all the microorganisms in my gut.

If there are more harmful bacteria than beneficial bacteria,

Various harmful bacteria negatively affect the body in different ways, leading to obesity.

On the contrary, if there are more beneficial bacteria than harmful bacteria,

Various beneficial bacteria help with dieting in different ways.

Therefore, to improve your health and diet, you need to enhance your eating habits to increase beneficial bacteria.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

A specific bacterium does not solely make us obese or enable us to lose weight.

I understand this, but...

So, what happens if you consume various types of bacteria instead of just one kind?

If you look at the probiotic products that are coming out these days,

Instead of using just one type, it is made by mixing several types of probiotics.

They coat the probiotics to ensure they survive all the way to the intestines and even add nutrients for them.

By consuming such probiotic products, I aim to help various probiotics settle in my gut.

After that, if you consume a product containing different probiotics, it will allow another type of probiotic to settle in the gut.

As good probiotics increase in the body, wouldn't it help with health and dieting?

I have tried taking a lot of probiotics, but they didn't seem to have much effect.

First of all, there are cases where I think the probiotics I took can settle and multiply in my gut.

Probiotics are bacteria that come in briefly when consumed, but disappear over time.

Because of this characteristic, there are people who experience effects when taking probiotics and others who do not.

Let's discuss the reasons in detail in the next video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure to have it appear in the top right corner.

If the video is not completed, another video is scheduled to be released.

If the video that appears in the upper right is not part 4 of the gut microbiome,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
