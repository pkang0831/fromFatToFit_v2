Why does a woman feel fatter when she looks in the mirror?

Hello, this is pkang.

One common story about dieting is that

The woman looks at her reflection in the mirror and feels that she is fatter.

The man looks at his reflection in the mirror and feels that he is less fat.

I saw a comment asking why there is this perception, and I'm curious about it.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

First of all, the fat that we refer to as body fat can be broadly divided into two types: visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat refers to the fat that is located right next to the internal organs.

The only place in the entire body where the internal organs are located is the abdomen.

When visceral fat accumulates, the belly protrudes.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat refers to the fat located just beneath the skin.

It is fat that is spread throughout the entire body, including the abdomen.

Fat on the arms, thighs, and sides all refers to this subcutaneous fat.

There is a video I made in the past titled [The Different Reasons for Men's and Women's Diets].

In the video, the man and woman have differences in their physical structures.

So when men accumulate body fat, it mainly builds up as visceral fat.

It was said that when women accumulate body fat, it mainly accumulates as subcutaneous fat.

The accumulation of body fat primarily differs based on gender.

Because of this, there is a difference in the emotions felt when looking at one's reflection in the mirror.

First, in the case of a man

When men accumulate body fat, it mainly builds up as visceral fat, which causes the belly to protrude more and more.

Subcutaneous fat tends to accumulate less relatively.

Other areas, excluding the abdomen, have relatively less fat.

Even if he is a man who is actually very obese,

When you touch your arms or thighs, you will feel firm muscles instead of soft fat.

So in the case of men, they look in the mirror and think, "If only my belly would go in a bit, that would be fine."

The belly is particularly protruding, so only the belly is visible.

And in the case of visceral fat, it is located deeper inside than muscle.

By tightening your abdominal muscles and pulling your stomach inward, you can somewhat reduce a protruding belly.

When I look in the mirror, the only area that feels problematic is my stomach.

If you apply force to that boat and push it inward, it will go in instantly.

In the case of men, they often feel relatively less overweight than their original appearance.

In the case of women, subcutaneous fat accumulates, leading to an overall increase in body weight.

When I look in the mirror because of this, there are many areas that I am very concerned about.

I'm concerned about the fat on my arms, thighs, belly, buttocks, sides, and back as well.

In fact, when dieting, it's not possible to lose fat from specific areas one by one.

Thinking in this way is meaningless, but...

First of all, when I look in the mirror, there are a lot of areas that are very noticeable.

Because there are many visible areas, it feels like there are a lot of problems.

And in the case of subcutaneous fat, it is structurally located outside of the muscles.

I can't engage my muscles to pull them inward like I can with visceral fat.

So, when a man tenses his stomach, he can temporarily pull in his protruding belly.

In the case of women, even if they exert strength in their arms or thighs, those areas do not temporarily become thinner.

When I looked in the mirror, there were several areas that seemed problematic.

There is no way to instantly look slim.

Many people feel that they are heavier than their original appearance.

It is easier to handle one big problem than to deal with several small issues.

It is a perception that many people have.

This recognition applies directly to the body as well.

A man whose belly sticks out when body fat accumulates tends to feel that the problem is relatively small.

A woman who gains weight in various parts of her body tends to feel the problem more significantly.

In a way, it is a natural phenomenon.

However, even if you gain weight in various parts of your body,

First, lose the arm fat, then the thigh fat, and after that, lose the belly fat.

Instead of proceeding one by one like this,

When you go on a diet, the fat from your entire body decreases all at once.

Just because there are many areas where you need to lose weight doesn't mean there are more diets you have to follow.

The amount of diet you have to do is the same anyway. It just looks like a lot.

So I hope you don't feel too much stress.

There are stories that women easily fall for strange diets.

Why is that?

In the next video, I will talk about strange diets.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not about a strange diet, then...

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
