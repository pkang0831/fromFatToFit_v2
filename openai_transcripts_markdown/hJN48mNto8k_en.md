Hello, this is pkang.

This is the fifth video about the stagnation period, created in response to questions about it in the comments.

This seems to be the last video in the stagnation series.

The playlist link for the traffic jam video is displayed in the top right.

If you would like to watch the previous video, you can click to view it.

Since the content continues from the previous video,

It is recommended that you watch the previous video if possible.

In part 1 of the video, the method for distinguishing between fake identity and real identity is discussed.

In Part 2 of the video, we will discuss homeostasis and yo-yo effects.

I looked into why plateaus occur on a calorie-restricted diet and how to break through them.

In Part 3 of the video, we will discuss the reasons for plateaus in a ketogenic diet and how to break through them.

In part 4 of the video, we will discuss ways to break through a plateau on the ketogenic diet.

We talked about the reasons why protein restriction should not be done.

In this video, I will discuss a diet without plateaus based on the content presented earlier.

Many people when they are on a diet

At the beginning of a diet, I set a meal plan and try to stick to it rigorously.

There are cases where people eat exactly the same food.

If that's difficult, I try to keep the total calorie intake or the ratio of nutrients similar each day.

However, strictly adhering to a diet like this is one of the causes of hitting a plateau.

Isn't sticking to a diet good for weight loss? Why does this cause a plateau?

Because the body gradually changes while dieting.

A body with a high amount of body fat is disadvantageous for survival.

The more body fat there is, the stronger the response to use that body fat to reduce it on its own.

So, the more severely obese a person is, the faster their body fat decreases at the beginning.

As you get closer to your normal weight, body fat tends to decrease less effectively.

In the early stages of a diet with high body fat,

Because there is body fat that naturally decreases, energy is supplied from here.

Even on a low-fat, low-calorie diet, there is no lack of energy.

In fact, when you build your diet with unrefined foods, the feeling of fullness lasts a very long time.

The reason for a natural decrease in meal size is here.

The food is low in calories, but the body does not lack energy.

The absorption rate is not increasing.

This is a situation where balance is achieved while body fat is decreasing.

However, this balance gradually changes over time.

The reason we diet is to reduce the body fat that is inside us.

So when you diet, body fat decreases and you get closer to a normal weight.

As you get closer to your normal weight, the response to use body fat on its own weakens.

When the amount of body fat used automatically decreases, the energy supplied from here also decreases.

You need to obtain what is lacking from food.

If you maintain the low-calorie diet you were following at the beginning of your diet, you will end up with a calorie deficit.

Then, due to a calorie deficit, the absorption rate increases and a plateau occurs.

So at the beginning of the diet, there was no problem with the meal plan at all.

As the diet progresses and the body changes, the meal plan becomes problematic.

If you are exercising while dieting, the same thing happens with carbohydrates.

When you first start exercising, your muscles are weak, so the intensity of the workout is low.

However, as you continue to exercise, your muscles develop and the intensity of the workouts gradually increases.

As muscle develops and exercise intensity increases, the amount of glycogen used increases.

As the amount of glycogen used increases, more carbohydrates will be needed for replenishment.

If you maintain the same amount of carbohydrates you were consuming during the time when you were exercising lightly in this situation,

The amount of carbohydrates remains the same, but since the required amount has increased, it becomes insufficient.

So when we diet, our bodies change.

As the body gradually changes, the necessary calories and nutrients also change.

If you ignore this and continue to maintain the same diet, problems will arise.

The most common issue among those is stagnation.

The reason why having a cheat day can help you break through a plateau.

On cheat days, many people eat a lot of food, which helps to replenish the lacking nutrients and calories.

In other words, if you gradually adjust your diet to match the changes in your body,

A diet without plateaus is also possible.

How can I create a diet without plateaus?

In a ketogenic diet that restricts carbohydrate intake, one often craves foods rich in carbohydrates.

On a low-calorie diet that restricts calories, you tend to crave greasy foods.

If a person is lacking certain nutrients in their body,

Foods rich in those nutrients create a desire to eat.

Based on this reaction, you should eat, but try to do so as irregularly as possible.

Don't overthink it.

First, continue with your current diet and observe your body's reactions.

If the portion of food is too small and you want to eat more, you can eat more bulky vegetables.

If you crave greasy food, it’s because you’re lacking in fat or calories.

Please increase your fat intake to raise your calorie intake.

If you want to eat meat, it means you are lacking protein, so you can add more protein to your diet.

At this time, the protein you consume should not be processed meats like sausages, ham, or patties, but rather raw meat.

If you want to eat carbohydrate foods like sugar, flour, and white rice,

Since you are lacking carbohydrates, you can eat more vegetables or fruits.

If you are already eating a lot of vegetables and fruits and are too full to eat more,

You can replace some vegetables or fruits with foods that have a higher carbohydrate density.

In the case of vegetables, there are 4 to 9 grams of carbohydrates per 100 grams.

In the case of potatoes and sweet potatoes, there are 20 grams of carbohydrates per 100 grams.

It's the same 100g, but it contains much more carbohydrates.

This has a high density of carbohydrates.

If you still feel like you're lacking carbohydrates after eating potatoes and sweet potatoes, you can switch to whole grains.

So, as long as my body is not lacking in nutrients, you can eat as much as possible in an irregular way.

On the contrary, in the case of food that one does not want to eat.

In this case, you do not need to eat.

For example, it has become the time to have a meal.

If you are full right now and don't want to eat, you don't have to have a meal.

Fasting diets are not good. It's said that low-calorie diets are not good either.

It feels like I have to eat food.

This means that I want to eat food right now and that it's not good to force myself to hold back when I'm hungry.

I am currently full and don't want to eat, so I don't have to force myself to eat.

I haven't eaten, but I'm full and don't want to eat.

This is because energy is being supplied as body fat is being burned.

At this time, there is no need to eat food to prevent the burning of body fat.

You don't have to eat.

If the diet feels too greasy, it means that there is a lot of fat.

You can reduce the amount of fat.

If you're tired of eating meat, it means you're getting too much protein.

Replace meat with eggs that have a low protein density, or

Alternatively, you can have a protein fasting day where you don't consume any protein.

Until I want to eat meat again.

The same goes for carbohydrates.

If you don't want to eat carbohydrates, you can also reduce the amount of carbohydrates.

If you feel that the portion of food is too large and it's hard to eat,

You can reduce the volume of the food.

Many people ask me about my diet in the comments.

I haven't specified the amount of meat in grams or vegetables in grams like that.

I always say to eat until you're full with whole, unprocessed foods, and if you don't want to eat, then you don't have to.

The reason for this is that ultimately, every person's body is different.

Muscle mass is different, body fat is different, activity level is different, and exercise amount is different.

The ability to digest and absorb food varies, as the digestive systems are different.

For this reason, there is essentially no diet plan that is effective for everyone.

Everyone's body is different, and the nutrients they need are also different.

In the end, I have no choice but to adjust my diet to fit my body.

To do this, I need to observe my body's reactions and listen to my body's signals.

It is said that the best approach is to create a diet while communicating with your body.

By doing this, there is no reason for a stagnation period to occur.

I understand the content of the video so far.

However, if you take care of your diet that well, you may be able to go from being obese to a normal weight, but...

I don't think I can achieve a beauty weight that is slimmer than my normal weight.

What should someone who wants to become slim at their ideal weight do?

The stagnation series videos will conclude with this video.

In the next video, I will talk about how to diet from a normal weight to a cosmetic weight.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

Once the video on how to diet from a normal weight to a beauty weight is completed,

I will make sure the video appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not a beauty weight video, then...

I am still in the process of making the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
