The Principles of an Interesting Story - How to Develop Your Sense of Humor Part 1

Hello, this is pkang.

Some people tell the same story in an interesting way, while others do it in a boring way.

Such differences can be influenced by the appearance, atmosphere, and speaking ability of the person telling the story.

It is also influenced by the principles of telling interesting stories.

If we were to compare, the influence of the principle is slightly greater.

Even if you have good looks, a great atmosphere, and speaking skills,

If you don't understand this principle, the atmosphere can become dull or the conversation can become boring.

In this video, we will explore the principles of interesting stories.

The principle of an interesting story is that...

How do you explain background knowledge? Or do you think about whether it has been explained or not?

Every story has a central event.

To understand the incident, background knowledge about it is necessary.

How you explain this can make the story interesting or boring.

Isn't that only applicable to very long stories?

That's not the case. It also applies to short jokes or internet memes.

For example, there is a popular internet slang in Korea called "Woody's level transformation."

What this is... is that Udyr is a character from a game called LOL.

This character has the characteristic that their abilities change depending on which animal they mimic.

Imitating a tiger increases attack power.

Imitating a turtle increases your defense.

You can make your opponent faint by imitating a bear.

Changing the animal being mimicked is called a transformation.

In situations where necessary, one must mimic the required animals to play the game in their favor.

I continuously use stance changes depending on the situation in the game.

When I heard the explanation, it sounded like a character that beautifully fights by mimicking the necessary animals in the required situations.

When you actually see it in the game, it feels a bit different.

Because when the enemy is weak and one is strong, they attack by imitating a tiger or a bear.

On the contrary, when they find themselves in an unfavorable situation, they mimic a turtle and run away.

In fact, avoiding unfavorable battles is a fundamental principle of strategy.

However, from the perspective of the opposing team,

When it is advantageous for them, they come making a big noise, imitating bears or tigers.

When it becomes disadvantageous for them, they turn into a turtle and hide in their shell to escape.

This looks really petty.

So, when someone who used to boast when they were in a favorable position changes their words or runs away when things turn against them, I see that.

It feels like using Udyr's stance switch, so it came to be called the Udyr-level stance switch.

In what situations would we use a Udyr-level stance switch?

A representative example is the process of naming the sled in the movie Cool Runnings.

What should we name the sled?

How about Tallulah?

It sounds like the name of a prostitute. Where did you get that name from?

It's my mother's name.

It's a very pretty name~

When I didn't know that Talula was my mother's name, I laughed and teased her, saying that the name was strange.

As soon as I found out it was my mother's name, I immediately changed my words to say it was a pretty name.

Changing one's words quickly depending on the situation is referred to as "Udyr-level stance switching."

I think it's an appropriate expression for those who know Udyr from playing LOL, so it's interesting.

People who don't play LOL and don't know Udyr can't understand what part is fun.

I don't understand the term "Udyr-level stance transformation" itself.

In reality, people who do not play LOL often really dislike LOL jokes.

So, it's not just long stories that require background knowledge.

Even simple jokes or puns can be funny only if you have the background knowledge.

A person who has a good sense of humor and tells stories well is someone who can explain background knowledge easily.

On the contrary, a person who lacks a sense of humor and cannot tell stories...

They are someone who is not good at explaining or does not explain well.

There are various ways to make explanations easier.

The common point of all methods is that they utilize empathy.

People who attend the same school or work at the same job see the same teachers and the same workplace supervisors.

I already have information about what they look like, what their speech is like, and what their nickname is.

So there are many cases where an explanation of background knowledge is not necessary.

This applies not only to the same school or workplace but also to any group that shares commonalities.

Even if you are not in the same company, if you belong to the same profession, you will have similar work experiences.

People who share the same hobbies have similar interests.

People from the same generation have similar experiences with trends.

People who belong to the same cultural sphere have similar cultural experiences.

So for people belonging to a certain group, there is a very interesting story.

On the contrary, it can become a boring story for people belonging to a different group.

The joke about "Udyr-level stance switching" is amusing to those who play LOL.

The reason it's not fun for someone who doesn't play LOL is exactly this principle.

To summarize, if we find commonalities between the other person and myself and share stories about similar experiences,

Even if you can't explain the background knowledge well, it's still possible to tell an interesting story.

But why are jokes from a boss who shares the commonality of working at the same company not funny?

In the next video, I will talk about questions like this.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to display the next video on the right once it's completed.
