Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video where I respond to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

Please tell me about oats.

In the first video, we explored whether oats are particularly more effective for dieting compared to other foods.

The video link is available in the top right corner, so if you're curious, you can click on it to watch.

In this video, I will talk about how to consume oats.

To get straight to the point,

Many people consume powdered oats as part of the oat diet.

Oat flour is not a food for dieting.

I will explain why that is from now on.

In the first video, we talked about the GI index of oats.

I mentioned that I would skip it because it will be explained in the second video.

The GI index of food is closely related to the form of the food.

A good example that can explain this well is the relationship between brown rice, white rice, and white rice flour.

If I eat a food called brown rice,

My body can remove the husk of brown rice, crush the contents inside, and absorb them.

The process of peeling and breaking down the contents is called digestion.

Digestion consumes time and energy.

Since you need to peel the skin off and crush the contents of the glutinous rice,

It takes a long time to digest, and it also consumes a lot of energy.

So digestion and absorption proceed slowly.

Because digestion and absorption are slow, it becomes a good food for dieting as it does not cause a significant rise in blood sugar.

White rice is food that has undergone a milling process, where the husk of brown rice is removed.

When we eat white rice, the husk has already been removed.

There is no need to peel the skin during the digestion process.

You can melt the contents right away.

Therefore, it can be digested and absorbed in a shorter time and with less energy compared to brown rice.

Because digestion and absorption occur quickly, there is a characteristic of blood sugar rising rapidly.

Due to these differences, although they are the same rice, brown rice is good for dieting while white rice is not a good food.

Rice flour is crushed during the grinding process, so its contents are broken down.

It is a food that is digested and absorbed faster than white rice and raises blood sugar levels even more.

I should have done the digestion process that was originally supposed to happen in my body through processing in advance.

Food that has strayed from its original form is called refined food.

On the contrary, food that has not been processed and is close to its original form is called unrefined food.

Those who are quick-witted may have already noticed the issues with oat flour from the content provided so far.

Brown rice is good for dieting. So I want to eat brown rice.

The texture of the brown rice skin is uncomfortable, so I peel it off to make white rice.

To make it easier to eat white rice, grind it to make white rice flour.

It sounds strange to say, "I'm on a brown rice diet" while eating white rice flour.

This is no longer eating brown rice; it is eating white rice flour.

Similarly, oats are good for dieting, so I am trying to eat oats.

The texture is uncomfortable due to the oat's husk, so remove the husk.

The oat flour made for easy consumption of oats is not a diet food.

The processed oat flour is called instant oats.

Oatmeal made by adding water to oat flour is instant oatmeal.

Instant oatmeal has a glycemic index that is not different from white rice.

You can make oatmeal using oat flour.

It is normal that mixing it with milk does not have a weight loss effect.

So when I see these diet reviews,

There are reviews stating that there is no effect from the diet, and that instead, people have gained weight.

That's normal; it's not a diet food to begin with.

In that case, can I eat unrefined oats that are as close to their original form as possible instead of flour?

Unrefined oats are whole grains, so it is true that they have a weight loss effect.

However, this raises the question, "Is it really necessary to eat oats?"

Powdered oats can be poured with hot water or

If you mix it with water and heat it in the microwave, the oatmeal is ready. It's very convenient, right?

However, if you want to make oatmeal with unrefined oats, you need to keep stirring and boiling it for 20 to 30 minutes.

It takes a lot of time and effort.

After all this effort to make it, oatmeal... doesn't taste very good, does it?

If you put the same time and effort into cooking other unrefined foods, you can enjoy them much more deliciously.

Oat milk can be consumed by mixing it with powder, but it can also be enjoyed by adding roasted oats.

Is it okay that the roasted oats are round?

The roasted oats that go into oat milk are not ground and retain their shape.

It has a lower GI index than oat flour.

However, this also has a limited diet effect because the skin has been removed for texture.

In that case, can't we just get oats with the husk and put them in milk? We can do that.

Oats with the husk have a very coarse texture, so they are not suitable for eating mixed with milk.

And as mentioned in the first video, oats are not necessarily better for dieting.

There is no need to go to such lengths to eat oats.

I will summarize.

If you want to eat oats for the purpose of dieting,

It is better to consume unrefined oats that still have the husk rather than oat flour.

Even if you eat unrefined oats, it doesn't have a greater weight loss effect compared to other foods.

If you are not a fan of oats, there is no need to force yourself to eat them.

Sounds plausible, right?
