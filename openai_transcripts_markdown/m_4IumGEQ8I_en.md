Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video talking about intermittent fasting.

In Part 1 of the video, we discussed the most important fundamental principles of intermittent fasting.

In the second part of the video, we explored the reasons why some people find it difficult to practice intermittent fasting.

In this video, if you are practicing intermittent fasting,

I would like to talk about the claim that there is no need to restrict the food we eat.

Since the content of the video is continuously connected from the beginning,

If you haven't watched the previous video, it's best to watch them in order.

For those who want to watch the previous video, the playlist link is available in the top right corner.

If you click, you can watch the videos in order starting from the one before.

If you have watched parts 1 and 2 of the video,

You understand that intermittent fasting and intermittent binge eating are different, right?

Sometimes, there are people who say that as long as you stick to the fasting hours, it's okay to binge eat.

The claim is completely opposite to what was presented in Parts 1 and 2 of the video.

The reason for this claim is due to the high-calorie intermittent fasting experiment.

What this is about is that intermittent fasting has become popular.

When eating foods with the same calories

There have been many experiments comparing eating while practicing intermittent fasting to not eating at all.

There is an experiment that compared when a person consumes more calories than their daily metabolic rate.

So a person consumes more calories in food than the basal metabolic rate in a day.

It compares eating while practicing intermittent fasting to eating without it.

What results came out of that experiment?

When I ate high-calorie foods without practicing intermittent fasting,

The results showed an increase in body fat.

I practiced intermittent fasting while eating foods with the same calories, and...

The result shows that body fat has not increased or has even decreased.

To put it simply,

It's a large amount of food that could lead to obesity if not following intermittent fasting.

If you just eat this and have a fasting period,

The result is that either weight loss occurs or at least obesity does not happen.

So, based on this, the argument has emerged that if one simply adheres to the fasting period, there is no need to control food intake.

Why did this result come out?

Everything in the world has a limit to the capacity that can be handled at one time.

If you try to process more than this limit at once, it won't be handled properly because you're exceeding the limit.

To make it easier to understand, for example,

Even if you put enough rice and water for 10 servings into a rice cooker designed for 3 to 4 people,

That doesn't mean it becomes enough rice for ten servings; it's exceeding the limit, so it doesn't cook properly.

The human digestive system also has a similar limit to its capacity.

If you eat a large amount of food at once that exceeds this limit,

Of course, the digestive system is not functioning properly, so digestion is not happening correctly.

So if the food is such that it would increase body fat when eaten in three meals a day,

Objectively speaking, there is a lot of food.

If you eat all this food within a span of 8 hours,

So much food is coming in a short amount of time.

It has exceeded the limits of the digestive system, so the digestive system cannot process it.

So, even though I eat a lot of food, my body fat doesn't increase.

Alternatively, it is possible for body fat to decrease.

However, we are eating too often and too much.

The digestive system is being overworked and the body's metabolism is breaking down.

Intentionally having a fasting period during which you do not eat food.

Let's give the digestive system some time to rest and help the body's metabolism recover healthily.

This is the original purpose of intermittent fasting, isn't it?

However, the act of eating a large amount of food that the digestive system cannot process at once

Is intermittent fasting really the right approach? When you think about it, it's not; it strays from its original purpose.

And because humans are creatures of adaptation, if these eating habits are continued in the long term,

The digestive system adapts here, allowing it to handle a larger capacity at once.

If this happens, the capacity to process increases, which may weaken the effects of the diet.

Alternatively, there are cases where body fat may increase further.

In the first part of the video, I discuss the essential reasons why fasting hours are necessary for intermittent fasting without fully understanding that aspect.

It was said that simply understanding "having fasting hours means intermittent fasting" could lead to misunderstandings.

This corresponds to that.

Eating food in this way completely deviates from the original purpose of intermittent fasting.

It's called intermittent fasting because there are periods of fasting.

I think that by considering intermittent fasting, I can achieve the same effects.

However, this is not intermittent fasting; it's intermittent binge eating.

So you can't achieve the same effect.

In the next video, we will address the second question that was mentioned at the end of part two.

I will talk about people who find it difficult to stick to fasting times while eating unrefined foods.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

I will make sure the next video appears on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not the intermittent fasting part 4 video,

I am still in the process of making the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
