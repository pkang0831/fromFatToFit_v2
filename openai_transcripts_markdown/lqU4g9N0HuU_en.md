Hello, this is pkang.

This is the ninth video about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In Part 1 of the video, the types of low-carb, high-fat diets are discussed.

In the second part of the video, a strange low-carb, high-fat diet is created by mixing two different meal plans.

In Part 3 of the video, refined foods and unrefined foods are discussed.

In Part 4 of the video, a balanced diet.

In part 5 of the video, a recommended low-carb, high-fat diet is discussed.

In the sixth video, we discuss low-carbohydrate diets and insulin.

In Episode 7, we discuss low-carb diets and exercise.

In the eighth video, we talked about whether we need to follow a lifelong diet plan.

In this video, I will talk about the reasons why you can lose weight even when you eat enough.

Since the content continues from the first part of the video,

You need to watch the videos in order starting from Part 1 to understand the content without any misunderstandings.

If you haven't watched the videos in order starting from Part 1, the playlist link is available in the top right corner.

You can click the link and watch the videos in order starting from Part 1.

When you hear that you need to reduce body fat for dieting,

I think we should use that body fat.

And to use body fat, what nutrients do you think should be consumed in insufficient amounts?

If there is a lack of fat, the body will use the amount of fat that is lacking from body fat reserves.

The diet that comes from this idea is a calorie-restricted diet that limits fat intake.

If you eat insufficient carbohydrates, your body will replace the lacking carbohydrates with body fat.

The diet that comes from this idea is a low-carbohydrate diet that restricts carbohydrate intake.

However, body fat can decrease even if nutrients are not lacking.

To help with understanding, let me briefly talk about muscles.

The reduction of muscle mass in the body is referred to as muscle loss.

What actions should be taken to cause muscle loss?

For example, not engaging in any activities and just lying in bed all day.

Or do you have to intentionally eat too little for muscle loss to occur? That's not the case.

Of course, if you continue to lie in bed or eat insufficiently, muscle loss will occur.

Even if you maintain a normal level of activity and eat enough food, muscle loss can still occur.

This refers to a person who has a very high amount of muscle mass.

People who consistently engage in high-intensity exercise will see an increase in their muscle mass.

In this person's case, even if they engage in sufficient activity and eat an adequate amount of food,

If you don't exercise, you will experience muscle loss.

So, people with a lot of muscle mass worry about muscle loss when they are unable to exercise.

So it's not that any specific action causes muscle loss, but rather...

The action that leads to the development of a lot of muscle in the body is that if you don't exercise, muscle loss occurs.

This can be directly applied to body fat.

People who frequently eat processed foods often experience false hunger, leading them to eat more.

If this continues to happen, body fat will increase, leading to obesity over time.

So the excess body fat you have now has accumulated because you have eaten too much food.

Just like a person who has built a lot of muscle through exercise will lose muscle if they stop working out.

A person who has gained body fat from eating too much food will lose body fat if they stop eating so much.

It's not about eating less of something; it's about not overeating.

Muscles built through exercise will shrink if you stop working out because they are no longer needed.

Does this apply the same way to body fat?

You can think about whether the body fat accumulated in our bodies is necessary or not.

Are we in an environment where it's difficult to obtain food right now, and is that why we need emergency rations and are accumulating body fat?

No.

Too many nutrients are absorbed from processed foods, and because of this, too much insulin is secreted.

It's accumulated due to too much insulin, not because the body needed to store fat.

It's not something I accumulated out of necessity, so from the body's perspective, body fat is unnecessary.

Just as unnecessary muscles diminish when you don't exercise, unnecessary body fat will also naturally decrease.

Muscles consume energy even when at rest, so I understand that they reduce activity to conserve energy.

Body fat does not consume energy; it is a stored form of energy.

Does the body that is trying to save energy think it doesn't need body fat?

As mentioned in the question, the human body has a response to conserve energy.

However, having a lot of body fat is not necessarily advantageous for energy conservation.

For example, if you are going on a backpacking trip to a place that takes three days to reach on foot,

Between taking food for 3 days and taking food for 10 days,

Which option saves energy?

Taking three days' worth of food is an action that saves energy.

Because 10 days' worth of food is three times heavier than 3 days' worth, and 3 days' worth of food is sufficient.

However, taking food for 10 days that is more than three times heavier is a waste of energy.

Carrying heavy food requires more energy.

Similarly, a body with a high amount of body fat is heavy due to the weight of the body fat.

Moving heavy weights consumes a lot of energy.

So in situations where it is easy to obtain food,

Carrying excess body fat continuously results in a waste of energy.

On the contrary, when you feel hungry, if you force yourself to endure the hunger and do not eat,

From the body's perspective, it is in a situation where obtaining food is difficult, so body fat is recognized as necessary as emergency food.

Because we recognize that body fat is necessary, we tend to conserve and use it sparingly.

This is why people say that starving diets or low-calorie diets are not good.

I know that if you're hungry, you can just eat, but what do you do if you're not hungry?

Since I'm eating unrefined foods, I don't feel hungry, so I eat less, and it seems to be lower in calories.

If you are not hungry, you don't have to force yourself to eat.

I briefly mentioned it in the video of Part 5.

One reason to eat unprocessed foods is to restore the body's signals to normal.

When the body's signals normalize, you can start to trust these signals.

Being trustworthy applies to both being hungry and not being hungry.

The signal has returned to normal, but the reason for not feeling hungry is

It means that there is no lack of energy in the body.

If the amount of food you eat is small, why might you not feel low on energy?

This is because the body is using the stored body fat.

So when I have a sufficient meal when I'm hungry, my body doesn't really need a lot of body fat.

Since a lot of body fat is not needed, I plan to use body fat.

When body fat is used, energy is supplied to the body.

Since energy is supplied from body fat, there are situations where food is not necessarily needed.

So, that's why I don't feel hungry.

At this time, there is no need to force yourself to eat, as it will prevent your body from using stored fat.

When you use a certain amount of body fat, you will feel hungry, and at that time, you can eat food.

You can think of artificially creating fasting periods in intermittent fasting as utilizing this mechanism.

It's great that you can lose weight without having to force yourself to endure hunger.

Does the effect appear the same regardless of whether it's a man or a woman?

I've heard that a low-carb, high-fat diet is effective for men but not for women.

In the next video, we will discuss this question.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not part 10 of the low-carb, high-fat diet series, then...

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
