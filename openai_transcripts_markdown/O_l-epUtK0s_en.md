I have reached my diet goal weight, but I don't look slim.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I reached my weight loss goal, but I received a message saying that I don't look slim, so I want to talk about it.

First, let's read the content of the story.

Mr. pkang, I need to have a goal because I'm the type who works hard when I have one.

When you start a diet, you set a target weight, right?

That was my friend's weight.

My friend is about the same height as me, but they are slim.

After several failures, I finally reached the same weight as my friend.

My friend looks slim at first glance, but I do not.

I'm not fat, but I'm not slim either; I'm just average.

There is still some belly fat on my lower abdomen.

Why is there such a difference when the height and weight are similar?

I worked really hard on my diet, but seeing these results makes me feel discouraged.

They say that even if the weight is the same, the body can be different if the muscle mass is different.

It is true that I haven't been able to exercise due to a lack of time while I was on a diet, but...

My friend doesn't exercise either.

Just in case, I measured it with the InBody scale.

There was no significant difference in muscle mass either.

But why is this happening?

This is the story of such content. Let's discuss it in detail.

First of all, the accuracy of home body composition scales is not very high.

When measured with a home body composition scale, just because the muscle mass is similar...

In reality, it is difficult to say that the muscle mass of the person sharing their story and their friend is similar.

However, what the person who shared the story is curious about is not this.

So, let's assume that the muscle mass of the person sharing their story and their friend is similar, and I'll proceed with the discussion.

If height, weight, and muscle mass are similar, we should assume that body fat percentage is also similar.

In that case, if height, weight, muscle mass, and body fat are all similar...

Can one person be slim while the other may not be slim?

That can happen. There are different types of body fat.

When I see the content that says I couldn't exercise because I was short on time,

It can be inferred that the person in the story lost weight solely through diet without exercising.

When the goal of the diet is to weigh the same as a friend.

You can tell that I focused on losing weight.

If you focus on losing weight through diet alone without exercise,

Most people diet by eating less food.

This becomes a problem.

The body fat in our bodies can be broadly divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat that accumulates next to the organs.

Because they are close to the internal organs and gathered in one place.

It's a type of fat that is good for energy use.

Excess energy can be stored as visceral fat.

Insufficient energy can be supplemented by stored body fat.

It is a type of energy storage known as fat.

Subcutaneous fat is the fat located beneath the skin, and it is the outermost layer of fat on the body, excluding the skin.

Because it is too far from the internal organs and scattered throughout the body.

It is fat that is difficult to utilize for energy.

It is fat that protects the body from external shocks or serves the role of maintaining body temperature.

Now let's think about it.

What happens if you eat less food and the energy entering your body decreases?

As the energy entering the body decreases, it leads to a situation of energy deficiency.

To replenish that lacking energy

You will extract energy from the energy storage, which is visceral fat.

So, the visceral fat will decrease.

However, the subcutaneous fat does not decrease or may even increase.

Humans are warm-blooded animals that need to maintain a constant body temperature.

If body temperature is not maintained and drops, it can lead to death from hypothermia.

However, boiling water at 100 degrees will eventually cool down over time.

To keep the water warm, you need to keep boiling it.

It means that you need to keep putting in energy.

The same goes for a person's body temperature.

But what happens if you reduce your food intake for dieting?

It becomes increasingly difficult to continuously secure the energy needed to maintain body temperature.

In this situation, I try to lose as little body heat as possible.

If you want to keep the water warm but can't keep boiling it,

You can think of it as putting water in a thermos.

Subcutaneous fat is the fat that protects the body from external shocks or helps maintain body temperature.

So if you diet by eating less food,

While visceral fat decreases, subcutaneous fat becomes more necessary.

It is difficult to reduce body fat by eating less food for this reason.

Visceral fat is the fat that is located deep inside the body, surrounding the organs.

This internal organ and visceral fat are covered by muscle.

Muscles are strong and resilient enough to support and move the body.

So even if my visceral fat increases and my belly tries to stick out,

It is possible for the muscles to apply pressure.

Of course, if the visceral fat increases to the point where it pushes the muscles outward, that would be a problem.

If it is within the normal range of visceral fat.

It looks slim because the muscles are pressing, so there is no problem.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is the fat located beneath the skin.

Except for the skin, it's the outermost part of the body.

Because it is outside the muscle, it cannot press or hold the muscle.

The skin does cover the subcutaneous fat, but...

The skin is too weak to withstand the weight of fat, unlike muscles.

So when body fat increases, it becomes saggy and loose.

This is what we call life.

Now let's think about it.

The person who shared their story and their friend assumed that they had the same body fat percentage.

The person shared that they have been dieting by reducing their food intake, but...

By doing this, the visceral fat that acts as an energy storage will decrease.

However, my friend did not follow a diet that involved reducing their food intake.

Therefore, compared to the person sharing their story, you may have relatively more visceral fat.

It is assumed that the total amount of body fat you have is the same.

Individuals with low visceral fat tend to have relatively high subcutaneous fat.

A friend with a lot of visceral fat tends to have relatively less subcutaneous fat.

It was said that visceral fat can be held in check by muscles, so there is no problem with looking slim.

So my friend's body, which has a lot of visceral fat and little subcutaneous fat, is slim.

However, the person's body has low visceral fat and high subcutaneous fat.

Subcutaneous fat is located outside of the muscles, so the muscles cannot hold it in place.

So it becomes droopy and saggy.

It's because of this fat that I don't look slim.

Even if the amount of body fat is the same,

It depends on whether that body fat is visceral fat or subcutaneous fat.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

The body fat in our body is largely divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat serves as an energy storage.

Subcutaneous fat serves the role of clothing.

Second

A diet that involves eating less food is

While it is possible to reduce visceral fat, which serves as an energy storage.

It is difficult to reduce subcutaneous fat, which serves the role of clothing.

Third

Subcutaneous fat is located outside of the muscles, so the muscles cannot hold the subcutaneous fat in place.

Therefore, when there is an increase in body fat, it becomes saggy and loose.

If there is a lot of subcutaneous fat, it is difficult to appear slim.

If the goal is to look slim,

Dieting by reducing meal portions is not a good choice.

I can organize it like this.

So, how can I reduce body fat?

You need to exercise.

There was a question about how to exercise in the past, so I made a video about it.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

If you are curious about how to reduce subcutaneous fat, you can click here to see more.

So, do I need to eat less while exercising?

No, that's not it.

In the first place, dieting is not about eating less.

I need to change the types of food I eat.

In a video explaining the principles of dieting, I talked about this part in detail before.

I will make sure to display related videos in the upper right corner.

Stress is bad for dieting.

I heard that exercising puts stress on the body.

So, isn't exercise bad for dieting?

That's not it.

I made a video before because the same question came up.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
