Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video created in response to a question about how thin people can gain weight that was posted in the comments.

In the first part of the video, we will discuss the common responses that a thin person hears when they express a desire to gain weight.

When we followed that story, we talked about why we couldn't achieve the desired results.

The link to Part 1 of the video is displayed in the upper right corner, so if you want to watch it, you can click on it.

In this video, a thin person who wants to gain weight...

I will talk about the reasons for not gaining weight and the solutions.

The fundamental reason why someone who wants to gain weight is not gaining weight is

It is because the amount of food absorbed by the body is small.

I have mentioned it a few times in other videos as well.

A person cannot absorb 100% of the nutrients from the food they eat.

A certain percentage is digested and absorbed, while the nutrients that cannot be processed are excreted as they are.

How much of the nutrients from the food consumed have been absorbed? This is referred to as the absorption rate.

This absorption rate is not a fixed value; it changes depending on the situation.

The fluctuation in this absorption rate is closely related to homeostasis, which seeks to maintain the current state.

When the amount of food consumed increases, the body tries to maintain the current weight by lowering the absorption rate.

When the amount of food consumed decreases, the body tries to maintain the current weight by increasing the absorption rate.

Because of this, if you go on a diet and eat less or starve yourself,

The absorption rate of food is gradually increasing.

After the diet is over, when I ate the same amount of food I used to eat.

With the increased absorption rate, more food is absorbed by the body.

Sometimes, a yo-yo effect occurs, resulting in gaining more weight than before the diet.

In the case of thin individuals, there are various factors that lead to a very low absorption rate.

If you force yourself to eat a lot of food when your absorption rate is low,

Due to the homeostasis that aims to maintain the current weight, the absorption rate decreases.

So even if you force yourself to eat a lot of food you don't want to, you won't gain weight easily.

Usually, when someone says they want to gain weight, the common advice is to eat a lot.

The reason many people give up is that even if they force themselves to eat a lot, they don't gain weight.

So... how can we increase the absorption rate?

You just need to create a situation where your body requires more nutrients.

Thin people tend to avoid exercising because they are afraid of losing more weight.

If you don't exercise, you don't need additional nutrients.

In that case, the absorption rate would naturally not increase.

On the contrary, when you exercise, various reasons create a situation where your body needs more food.

For example, when you do exercises to build muscle, you consume glycogen in the muscles during the workout.

To replenish this glycogen, carbohydrates are needed.

As you exercise, you gradually burn more calories, and as calories are burned, your body needs fat for replenishment.

When you continuously apply load to your muscles through exercise, the muscles need to grow in size to resist that load.

To increase muscle size, protein is necessary.

When you exercise like this, you will find that you need more of three things: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

In that case, the body will require more food.

So even if you eat the same food, it can be absorbed more and lead to more weight gain.

The desire to eat increases, which can lead to an improvement in eating habits by consuming less food.

So it's not about the concept of forcing yourself to eat food you don't want to eat.

It creates a situation where the body needs food, and when the desire for food arises, one eats.

I understand what you’re saying, but I find it a bit difficult to exercise because I'm too thin.

Even a little bit of strenuous exercise makes me tired and my head spins.

It seems like it will be difficult to exercise. What should I do?

Thin people eat a lot of food, but their absorption rate is low, so they remain thin.

There are people who are thin because they actually eat a small amount of food.

If the amount of food you actually eat is small, the phenomenon you asked about may occur.

In the next video, for those who eat a small amount of food,

I will talk about how to exercise.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

I will make sure the next video appears on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not the third part of the "Skinny Person" series,

I am still in the process of making Part 3 of the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

If you found this video helpful, please subscribe and like it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
