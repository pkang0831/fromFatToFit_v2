Many people struggle to diet because they have a taste for foods that make them gain weight.

In the last video, we discussed that the reason for developing such tastes is due to the food we eat and the condition of our bodies.

If you change the foods you eat to a proper diet and change your body's condition with the right exercise,

As the body returns to normal, it was said that taste changes and the desire for foods that cause weight gain decreases.

In fact, there are quite a few comments on my video saying that their taste has changed.

It used to be a food I liked and ate often.

I followed the diet as instructed, but my taste changed, and now it doesn't taste good.

The link to the previous video is displayed in the top right corner.

However, there are people who have consistently followed a proper diet and exercise routine but have not experienced a change in their taste preferences.

In this case, the issue may be more about memories or thoughts related to the food rather than the taste of the food itself.

In this video, let's talk about this.

Usually, when someone says they want to eat a certain food, we think they want to eat it because it tastes good.

However, there are cases where it doesn't relate to taste.

The case of New Coke by Coca-Cola is a representative example.

The well-known companies associated with cola are Coca-Cola and Pepsi.

These two companies have been competing in the cola market for a very long time.

The leading player, Coca-Cola, was being pursued by the latecomer, Pepsi.

Pepsi emphasized that its prices are relatively lower in order to take market share away from Coca-Cola.

In this process, Coca-Cola is delicious but expensive, while Pepsi is affordable but lacks a bit in taste.

This perception arises.

From Pepsi's perspective, they don't like that kind of perception. That's why they conduct blind tests.

We conducted a test where the brand of the cola was hidden, and participants were asked to choose the tastiest cola based solely on flavor.

Interestingly, in the test, there were overwhelmingly more people who said that Pepsi tastes better than Coca-Cola.

Pepsi is inexpensive, but its taste is relatively inferior.

This was simply a preconceived notion, and the truth is that Pepsi actually tasted better.

Because such results came out in the blind test, Pepsi began to promote this on a large scale.

And finally, there was a growing expectation that Pepsi would become the industry leader by surpassing Coca-Cola.

People will naturally choose Pepsi because it is cheaper and tastes better than Coca-Cola.

However, no matter how much we promoted the results of this blind test, Pepsi never came in first place.

Why? Was the blind test result strange?

In reality, Coca-Cola tastes better, but Pepsi may have manipulated the results for promotional purposes.

Or it may be said that Pepsi tastes better, but the difference isn't that significant...

Yes, you can think that way. However, it wasn't like that.

Because after those test results came out, Coca-Cola started developing a new cola.

If, in reality, Coca-Cola tastes better, but Pepsi manipulated the results of the blind test, then...

If the results of the blind test were insignificant and showed no noticeable difference,

From Coca-Cola's perspective, there is no need to develop a new flavor of cola.

If Coca-Cola actually tastes better, then it would be enough for them to conduct a blind taste test to refute that.

However, the method chosen by Coca-Cola was to create a new cola called New Coke.

And with the launch of New Coke, they simultaneously discontinued the cola they had been selling.

So, it was intended to make the taste of New Coke the representative flavor of Coca-Cola, rather than the existing cola flavor.

In other words, it means that the situation was serious enough to require changing the flavor that represents the company.

If Pepsi's blind test were false or the difference were minimal, they wouldn't have gone this far.

So, was the newly created New Coke tastier than Pepsi?

Yes, that's right.

The reason Coca-Cola developed a new cola in the first place was due to test results showing that Pepsi tasted better.

Therefore, the goal of the new cola was to be tastier than Pepsi.

We continued to conduct research and development until we achieved this goal.

Of course, a cola that tastes better than Pepsi has been created.

In fact, Coca-Cola has conducted blind tests with hundreds of thousands of people.

The existing Coca-Cola has indeed been found to taste better than Pepsi.

Because of these results, we were able to make the decision to discontinue the existing cola.

So, did this New Coke become popular among people as the most delicious cola?

It didn't happen that way.

Coca-Cola stopped selling its original cola and began selling New Coke.

Thousands of complaints have been received nationwide, and over 500,000 consumers have started to protest.

Nationwide protests broke out, and the situation became serious enough to be reported in the news.

Ultimately, Coca-Cola will resume production of the original cola under the name Coca-Cola Classic.

This is a very famous case in marketing.

Isn't it strange?

If the desire to eat something is driven by taste being the most important factor,

The most delicious cola, New Coke, should have gained the greatest popularity.

Coca-Cola, which previously tasted worse than Pepsi, had to give up its number one spot to Pepsi.

However, what actually happened was the exact opposite.

Pepsi could not defeat Coca-Cola, and New Coke suffered from protests and demonstrations.

So, it's not the actual taste, but there are other factors that make it feel delicious.

What factors contribute to making something taste delicious?

There are various factors, but primarily, there are biases and familiarity.

Coca-Cola is the industry leader, so Coca-Cola is more expensive than Pepsi.

So, of course, Coca-Cola is going to taste better than Pepsi because of this bias.

In the blind taste test, Pepsi tasted better, but Pepsi could not beat Coca-Cola.

I feel that the Coca-Cola I've been drinking since I was young tastes better than the new New Coke.

The New Coke, which was rated the best in blind taste tests, failed to gain popularity.

From the same perspective, a person who has frequently eaten fattening foods since childhood is

Since I am familiar with that food, I think it tastes good.

Due to the preconceived notion that diet food is tasteless and fattening food is delicious,

It means that foods that can make you gain weight can be perceived as delicious.

But does it make sense that just thinking about something can make food taste better or make you like it more?

Yes, that makes perfect sense.

In the third part of the thought diet I created earlier, I talked about an experiment where just changing my thoughts led to weight loss.

To the housekeeper who cleans the hotel, provide some information to change their perspective.

When I visited again after four weeks, the housekeepers had lost weight.

It wasn't that I was given a diet or exercise plan; rather, I was just provided with information and changed my mindset, which led to weight loss.

The link to Part 3 of the Thought Diet video is being shared at the top right.

If you are curious about the details of this experiment, you can click to see more.

Returning to the original story.

When I changed my mindset, I was able to lose weight. This means that the opposite is also possible.

Therefore, it is possible to feel food tastes better just by thinking about it, or to have a desire for food as much as one wants.

So, it may not actually taste better, but you might perceive it as delicious or want to eat it due to preconceived notions, right?

It's a bit hard to understand, but let's just go with that. So what should we do?

The simplest way is to record my emotional changes on my smartphone and listen to it later.

Let's talk about this in more detail in the next video.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the "Weight Gain Taste" series,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
