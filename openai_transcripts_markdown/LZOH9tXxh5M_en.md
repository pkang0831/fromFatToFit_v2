Evidence of weight loss even without changes in body weight and body fat - Eye Body Part 3

When a person is working hard on something, they want to see the results of their efforts.

If you are working hard on your diet, you will want to check the results of your efforts.

The main indicators used at this time are weight and body fat percentage.

However, because of the reasons mentioned in the first and second videos,

Body weight and body fat percentage can be参考, but they are not accurate indicators.

So it's best to check your body with your own eyes by looking at your body.

In this video, I will talk about how to view your body through the eyes.

It's already well-known that using visual body measurements is a good indicator for dieting.

But why do many people prefer weight and body fat percentage instead of body measurements?

I don't know where to look with my eyes.

It's hard to tell if I've lost weight because I don't know where to look.

Since it's hard to understand just by looking, people tend to prefer numbers like weight or body fat percentage.

Moreover, the human eye is not as accurate as one might think.

I can hardly see anything other than what I'm focusing on.

I will show you a simple video now.

It is a video of a woman in black clothing and a woman in white clothing passing a ball to each other.

Count how many times the woman in white clothes has passed the ball.

The correct answer is a total of 16 times.

If you have good concentration, you might have seen something black passing by while getting the answers right.

By the way, did you know that it's a gorilla?

If you haven't seen it, please rewind the video to check.

You can see a gorilla passing between women wearing white clothes and women wearing black clothes.

It's an experimental video made by Harvard.

Half of the people who watched this video did not see the gorilla.

If you have seen the gorilla, did you notice that the color of the curtain changed?

If you saw the color of the curtains change, what about the woman in black who left?

Isn't it fun?

I clearly saw everything with my eyes, but I didn't fully comprehend it.

So, it means that if I'm not focusing on something, I can't see it properly.

This applies directly to body image as well.

There are certain areas on everyone’s body that tend to gain weight easily and are difficult to lose weight from.

And that area becomes particularly concerning.

If you are gaining weight in your arms and it's not coming off easily, the area you are most concerned about will be your arms.

If you are gaining weight on your thighs and it's not coming off easily, the area you are most concerned about would be your thighs.

In this state, when I do a body check, my eyes naturally go to my arms and thighs.

The reason that area is concerning in the first place is that the fat doesn't come off easily.

When I look at that area, it seems like I'm working hard on my diet, but I'm not sure if it's having any effect.

Other areas have clearly lost fat, but

After all, people tend not to see much beyond what they are focused on.

You will not be able to see the rest.

So when doing a body check, instead of focusing on the areas I'm concerned about,

It's better to think of it as looking for the areas where your body has lost weight.

So where should I look?

Basically, you should look at the areas where the flesh overlaps and where it touches.

First, for the face, you should look at the lower jaw area where the flesh of the chin and neck overlap.

When you gain weight, the jawline, which is the boundary between the chin and neck, becomes less visible.

The lower part of the face is not distinguishable from the neck, which can make the face appear larger.

The jawline is defined, distinguishing the neck from the face.

If it seems like your face is getting smaller, it means you are losing weight.

In the case of the upper body, you can see the armpit where the arm fat and chest fat overlap.

When you gain weight, the area under the armpit that overlaps will bulge out in a round shape.

Conversely, when you lose weight, what has risen may also disappear.

For the lower body, you just need to check if the thighs and calves are touching.

When standing with both feet together.

When you gain weight, your thighs and calves touch each other, leaving no gap.

The more weight you lose, the bigger this gap becomes.

You can start with these three as the basics and then add other elements.

Losing facial fat can make the eyes appear larger and the nose bridge higher.

The back fat or breast tissue may disappear.

Sometimes it feels like the clothes I used to wear are getting loose.

Isn't there a way to measure the circumference of the waist, arms, and thighs with a measuring tape?

Yes, that's a good method too.

However, in that case, the man can just relax.

In the case of women, it should be done according to the menstrual cycle.

I talked about it in the menstrual diet series.

Women may experience an increase in body water and swelling due to their menstrual cycle.

When the body swells, the body size becomes thicker.

Therefore, it is advisable for women to take measurements only during their golden period of dieting.

I talked about the golden period for dieting in the menstrual diet series.

For those who are curious about the details, you can click to see more.

In summary, depending on the person, there are areas where weight is easily lost and areas where it is not.

Rather than focusing continuously on the areas that are difficult to lose weight,

You can check your entire body to find any missing areas.

The presence of such areas means that the diet is going well.

I'm concerned about the fat on my arms, but no matter how I look at it, it doesn't seem like I'm losing any weight.

However, the facial features have become more distinct, and the legs have become thinner.

This means that the diet is going well.

So if you're losing weight from anywhere on your body, it means you're doing it right.

Once this is confirmed, there’s no need to worry much about the rest.

If you maintain it as is, eventually the areas where you haven't lost weight will also start to lose weight.

Don't focus on a specific area; instead, look for the areas where you have lost weight throughout your entire body.
