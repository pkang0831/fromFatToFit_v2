Hello, this is pkang.

This is the 11th video in the low-carb, high-fat diet series.

With this video, it seems that the low-carb, high-fat diet series will come to an end.

In Part 1 of the video, the types of low-carb, high-fat diets are discussed.

In the second part of the video, a strange low-carb, high-fat diet is created by mixing two different meal plans.

In Part 3 of the video, refined foods and unrefined foods are discussed.

In Part 4 of the video, a balanced diet is discussed.

In part 5 of the video, a recommended low-carb, high-fat diet is discussed.

In the sixth video, we discuss low-carbohydrate diets and insulin.

In Episode 7, we discuss low-carbohydrate diets and exercise.

In the 8th video, the reason why you don't have to eat a lifelong diet is explained.

In the 9th part of the video, the reason why body fat decreases even when not eating insufficiently.

In the 10th episode, we talked about how men lose weight while women gain weight on a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In this video, I will summarize the content of the previous video and discuss the Longo diet.

Since the content of the video is all connected, it is easier to understand if you watch it in order starting from Part 1.

For those who haven't watched the previous video, the playlist link is available in the top right corner.

You can click the link and watch the videos in order starting from Part 1.

The rules of the Longo diet are three.

The first is to reduce the intake of refined foods and eat unrefined foods.

In Part 3, I explained what refined and unrefined foods are and why we should reduce refined foods.

The second rule is to eat when you are hungry and not to eat when you are full.

The reason body fat accumulates is that we eat more food than necessary.

The reason for eating more food than necessary is

Processed foods disrupt the body's metabolism, leading to false hunger.

Reducing the intake of processed foods eliminates false hunger.

In reality, you only feel hunger when you actually need food.

If you eat little or do not eat at this time,

A low-calorie diet or starvation diet can actually hinder your weight loss efforts.

Because a hunger response occurs.

As mentioned in the video part 9, you don't have to intentionally starve yourself or eat less.

If you don't eat more food than necessary, body fat will naturally decrease.

You don't have to force yourself to endure hunger while dieting.

And when you start to reduce body fat, you begin to obtain energy from the body fat.

If we can obtain so much energy this way, then there would be no need to get energy from food.

So, a person who has a lot of body fat and is using that body fat on their own is...

Even if I eat little, I don't feel hungry.

It's because there is no lack of energy that I don't feel hungry.

In this situation, eating food even when you are not hungry is an action that prevents the burning of body fat.

So when you don't feel hungry, not eating can help with fat burning.

So, the act of forcing oneself to endure hunger in order to eat less is...

The hunger response kicks in, which interferes with dieting.

Eating less food because you are not hungry is helpful for dieting.

What matters is not whether the amount of food I eat is large or small, but rather...

What's important is whether I force myself to endure my hunger or not.

It means that if you're hungry because of this, you should eat, and if you're full, you shouldn't eat.

I know that eating regularly is good for health and dieting.

If you eat when you're hungry and don't eat when you're full, doesn't that make your meals very irregular?

Most people live their lives in a similar pattern every day, and as a result, the energy they consume at different times is also similar.

The fact that the energy consumption is similar by hour means that

It means that the time you feel hungry and the amount of food you need at that time are similar.

So if you eat according to your hunger, you will naturally have regular meals.

So, in the early stages of a diet when there is a lot of body fat, there is energy that comes from the reduction of body fat.

Due to this energy, there are times when I don't feel hungry, which leads to irregular meal times.

When body fat is sufficiently reduced, the energy supplied from body fat decreases.

When the energy supplied from body fat decreases, it is necessary to obtain energy from food.

This will naturally lead to having regular meals.

What should I do if I'm hungry and it's too late?

Even if I have to eat late because of work, there are situations where I have to eat and go to bed right away.

If I eat and go to bed right away, my stomach feels very uncomfortable the next day.

Depending on my lifestyle, I need to go to bed before midnight, but there are times when I feel hungry at 11 PM.

In this case, it's okay to have a meal a little earlier than 11 o'clock, even if you're not hungry.

The saying that you shouldn't eat if you're not hungry means that you shouldn't eat unnecessarily.

You should never eat when you're not hungry. It's not a rule that says you'll be in big trouble if you do.

If you regularly feel hungry at 11 PM, then that's when you need food.

Eating the necessary food a little earlier at this time does not cause any problems.

When I eat at 11 o'clock, I'm hungry, so I eat a full meal.

Since I’m eating a few hours earlier, I’m not really hungry, so it feels a bit overwhelming to finish a whole meal.

In this case, do I have to force myself to eat even if I don't want to?

There must be a certain amount of food that my body needs.

I'm worried that eating just a little because I don't want to eat might not be good for my diet.

If it's too much to eat in one meal, you can just have a little.

Because...

As you mentioned, there is a certain amount of food that the body needs.

Continuing to eat insufficiently will trigger hunger responses, which is indeed detrimental to dieting.

However, if I eat a little less for dinner today, I feel hungry in the morning to make up for what I lacked.

For example, if the amount of food I need to eat in a day is 200,

I lived a life where I ate 100 for lunch and 100 for dinner.

In this way, I don't feel hungry in the morning because the amount of food I eat is sufficient.

However, I originally need to eat 100 in the evening.

Since I moved my meal time earlier, I found it burdensome to eat a full meal, so I ate 50 units of food.

If this happens, with lunch being 100 and dinner being 50, the total amount of food I ate in a day is 150.

The required food is 200, so there is a shortage of 50.

This deficiency will manifest as hunger the next morning.

So originally, I wasn't hungry in the morning, but...

Since I had a light dinner, I felt hungry in the morning to make up for the lack of food.

If you have breakfast at this time, there will be enough food.

So I have a daily routine, and if there are convenient times for meals within that routine,

Please eat as much as you want at that time.

Then, the body adjusts its hunger signals to match the changed eating patterns.

So, it's like telling your body, "This time is convenient for me to eat."

Then, "If you're going to have a meal at that time, please eat this amount of food." This is how you respond with appetite.

The third point is that you need to change your diet while communicating with your body.

A significant number of people, when they set their diet at the beginning of their weight loss journey,

I believe that you should maintain that diet until the end of the diet.

However, there are two problems with this type of diet.

The first problem is that it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the same diet while dieting.

So at the beginning of the diet, I maintained my diet well, but then...

As the diet progresses, many people find it difficult to maintain their meal plan and end up giving up along the way.

The second point is that if you eat foods other than your diet after finishing your diet, you will experience a rebound effect.

The reason these problems arise is that our bodies change.

In the early stages of the diet, there would have been a lot of body fat, but as the diet progressed, the body fat would have decreased.

When body fat decreases, body weight also decreases.

Since your weight has decreased, starting to exercise will lead to changes in your muscle mass as well.

When body fat and muscle mass change, daily metabolism also changes.

As my body has changed like this, the amount of food my body needs will naturally change as well.

However, problems arise when you ignore these changes and continue to maintain the same diet.

So, I naturally need to adjust my diet to match the changes in my body.

When I adjust my diet to fit my body, it becomes easier to maintain the diet.

Continuing to diet becomes easier.

Once you reach your target weight, it's easier to avoid gaining it back even if you eat different foods.

The method of structuring a diet according to changes in the body was discussed in detail in part 5 of the plateau video.

The link to the video is displayed at the top right, so if you're curious about the content, you can click on it to watch.

So far, I have discussed the low-carb, high-fat diet in detail across a total of 11 videos.

Sounds plausible, right?

I hope it will be helpful to many people.

I will return with another video next time. Thank you.
