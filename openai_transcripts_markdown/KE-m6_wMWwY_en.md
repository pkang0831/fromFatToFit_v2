They say that if you eat less, your body becomes prone to gaining weight, but is there no opposite effect?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

If you diet with a very low-calorie diet by eating too little food,

As the basal metabolic rate decreases, the energy the body consumes also decreases.

As my body becomes prone to gaining weight, I experience yo-yo dieting.

When you study about dieting, it's the most common thing you can hear.

It's something I often talk about too.

If that story is true, shouldn't there also be a counter mechanism?

A question with this content has been posted.

If your basal metabolic rate decreases and dieting becomes difficult when you eat less food,

On the contrary, if you eat a lot, your basal metabolic rate should increase, making it easier to lose weight.

Why isn't that the case?

To conclude, there is such a mechanism.

In this video, let's talk about this.

Eating a lot of food leads to an increase in body fat.

When body fat increases, body weight becomes heavier.

To support and move a heavy weight, greater strength is required.

To exert greater strength, more muscle is needed.

So when your weight increases, your muscle mass also increases.

When muscle mass increases, the basal metabolic rate also rises.

Isn't most of the basal metabolic rate the energy consumed by organs like the brain, heart, liver, and lungs?

The energy consumed by muscles in the basal metabolic rate is said to be 20% of the total, right?

Yes, that's right.

It's not just that the basal metabolic rate increases simply because muscle mass has increased.

To maintain a larger, heavier, and more muscular body, organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs have to work harder.

Because you are doing more work, the energy you expend increases.

So, that means the basal metabolic rate increases.

If you look at the formula for calculating basal metabolic rate, you can see that it includes height and weight.

The taller you are and the heavier your weight, the higher your basal metabolic rate becomes.

So, if you eat less, your basal metabolic rate decreases, making it easier to gain weight.

If you eat a lot, your basal metabolic rate increases, making it easier to lose weight, right?

If that's the case, then why is there obesity?

It is due to the type of food being eaten.

The food we eat is broken down into nutrients and absorbed in our bodies.

Among the hormones that process the nutrients absorbed in this way, there is a hormone called insulin.

Insulin stores the carbohydrates we eat as glycogen and body fat.

Help proteins to be used for muscle synthesis.

It stores fat as body fat.

Among the foods we eat, there are some that cause a particularly high release of insulin.

Eating a lot of this kind of food can cause excessive insulin production.

In this case, the time required for the insulin to stabilize becomes longer.

This is a problem.

You can't go to the left while going to the right at the same time.

Because you are trying to do opposing things at the same time.

This is the same for hormones as well.

Insulin does several things, one of which is increasing body fat.

So, when it comes to body fat alone, insulin is a hormone that increases body fat.

In that case, it means that hormones that burn body fat are unlikely to be released before insulin stabilizes.

You can't go to the left while going to the right at the same time.

Let's connect the two stories that were mentioned earlier.

When the amount of food increases, the body becomes heavier.

When the body becomes heavier, the basal metabolic rate increases.

When the basal metabolic rate increases, more energy is required.

If you obtain more energy from body fat at this time,

Body fat is more effectively reduced, leading to weight loss.

When you eat a lot, your basal metabolic rate increases, and there is a mechanism by which this effect leads to weight loss.

However, if the food consumed at this time causes a lot of insulin to be released,

Due to the insulin hormone, it becomes impossible to draw energy from body fat.

The basal metabolic rate has increased, so the energy needed has also increased.

What should I do if I can't obtain that energy from body fat?

You need to eat more food to gain it.

So, the desire to eat food frequently and in large amounts arises.

If the food eaten at that time is one that causes a lot of insulin to be released,

Body fat increases, but this body fat cannot be used as energy.

So I eat more food.

This vicious cycle keeps repeating.

As a result, they will gradually become more obese.

If we summarize the content so far in two points,

If you eat less, your basal metabolic rate decreases, making it easier to gain weight.

Eating a lot increases your basal metabolic rate, making it easier to lose weight.

While the insulin hormone that stores the second body fat is being released,

It is difficult for hormones that use body fat as energy to be produced.

So, there is a mechanism that makes it easier to lose weight when you eat a lot.

If you eat foods that cause excessive insulin hormone release,

It's difficult to use body fat, which is why weight doesn't decrease and obesity gradually increases.

If you say this in reverse,

By changing the types of food you eat, you can prevent excessive secretion of insulin hormone.

It means that body fat will naturally decrease and you will lose weight.

To diet, you don't have to eat less or starve yourself.

You need to change the types of food you eat.

How should I change the types of food I eat?

What foods cause a lot of insulin to be released?

What foods help to reduce insulin production?

In a previous video about diet plans, I explained it in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click here to see it.

Insulin is a hormone that processes nutrients, so it is released when you eat, right?

It seems like the problem is that I eat food often and in large amounts, which causes insulin to keep being released.

So, if I don't eat until my insulin stabilizes, will I lose weight?

Yes, it works.

The meal method that actually utilizes such an approach is intermittent fasting.

The problem is that it's not easy to hold out without eating until the insulin stabilizes.

Even if you endure hard work, there are often cases where a reward mentality leads to binge eating.

There have been a lot of questions about intermittent fasting, so I previously discussed it in detail in a series.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

Most questions about intermittent fasting have already been answered, so if you're curious, you can click and take a look.

A lot of nutrients are entering the body.

If the problem is that a lot of insulin hormone is released to process that nutrient, then...

What happens if you chew food just to taste it and then spit it out?

Since I didn't swallow it, the nutrients aren't entering my body.

Then insulin doesn't get released, right?

You shouldn't do that.

Chewing food just to taste it and then spitting it out is called "chew and spit."

There was a question about spitting in the past, so I made a video explaining it in detail.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
