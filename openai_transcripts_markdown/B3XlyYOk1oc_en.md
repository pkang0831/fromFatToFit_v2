I heard that frozen vegetables have no nutritional difference from fresh vegetables. Is it okay to blend frozen vegetables and eat them?

Let's start by discussing the differences between fresh vegetables and frozen vegetables.

Basically, all living organisms consume energy at every moment.

This is no different from vegetables.

The vegetables grown in the field have a lot of nutrients because they obtain them from the soil.

To replenish the energy it consumes with the nutrients from the soil.

It accumulates what is left as nutrients.

The problem arises after the harvest from the field.

Since it can no longer obtain nutrients from the field, it begins to consume the nutrients it has.

So, regular vegetables are most nutritious right after they are harvested.

The longer the distribution process or the display time in stores, the more the nutrients gradually decrease.

In the case of frozen vegetables, they are harvested, processed, and frozen immediately.

Even if the distribution time is long, there is not much loss of nutrients.

However, during the freezing process, some nutrients are destroyed.

There are cases where frozen products are distributed with the refrigeration units turned off in order to reduce costs during the distribution process.

In this case, as the vegetables thaw, nutrients are lost at an incredible rate.

It is common to refreeze vegetables that have been thawed like this and sell them.

In this case, it is difficult to distinguish by appearance, but the loss of nutrients is serious.

To summarize:  
1. Freshly harvested common vegetables.

2. Frozen vegetables that have not been thawed.

3. Common vegetables after some time has passed since harvest.

4. Vegetables that have been thawed and then refrozen.

You can consider that the nutrients are abundant in this order.

In that case, you can choose the vegetables that suit you based on your situation, whether they are fresh or frozen.

For example, if you have knowledge about the freshness of vegetables, you can determine the harvest time.

Or a place to purchase that you can trust and buy from.

For those who quickly consume vegetables at home, regular vegetables are better.

However, if you have knowledge to distinguish vegetables or a trusted place to purchase them,

For those who do not consume vegetables quickly at home.

Since time passes inside the refrigerator and nutrients are lost anyway,

In such cases, frozen vegetables are a better choice.

And for those who have no knowledge of when to harvest and no trusted place to purchase from.

You can just comfortably eat frozen vegetables anyway, since you won't be able to know.

If the frozen vegetables you purchased show signs of having been thawed and refrozen, consider changing your place of purchase.

What are the characteristics of thawing and then refreezing?

Vegetables release a large amount of moisture during the thawing process.

If you refreeze vegetables, the moisture will freeze again.

So if there is an excessive amount of ice on the surface of the purchased vegetables,

If the water is frozen in a lump.

It may be vegetables that have been thawed and then refrozen.

In this case, it would be better to change the purchasing company.

Isn't the water that comes out during the process of preparing and washing the frozen vegetables?

There is definitely a possibility of that.

However, frozen vegetables are sold by weight, right?

In the case of a company that froze products without draining the water from the cleaning process.

This means that the amount of contents removed is equal to the weight of the water that was frozen together.

It's not necessarily good for a business to operate this way.

So in such cases, it is advisable to change the purchasing company.

The question of whether it is okay to grind and eat the second vegetable depends on the purpose of eating the vegetable.

In the case of general vegetables that have not been consumed.

We need to directly carry out the process of chewing, breaking down, and dissolving with gastric juice in our bodies.

This digestive process consumes time and energy.

Vegetables take a long time to digest.

It has the characteristic of not absorbing all the nutrients and calories, and instead expelling them from the body.

As a result, the nutrients obtained are small, but the energy consumed is significant because the digestion time is long.

So, when it comes to dieting, eating vegetables until you feel full is not a problem.

Even if you eat a lot, the calories that enter your body are not significant.

The more you eat, the more calories you consume.

However, when it is ground and eaten,

Because the process replaces some of the digestive work that my body is supposed to do.

The digestion time becomes very short.

So, you will be able to absorb most of the nutrients and calories.

If you are worried that the nutrients from vegetables won't be absorbed while you need to eat them for your health,

Eating blended vegetables is good for absorption.

To summarize,

If the purpose of eating is to obtain the good nutrients in vegetables, it is better to consume them in a blended form.

However, if you are eating for diet purposes, it's better to choose regular vegetables that are not processed.

I want to eat vegetables for dieting purposes, but is there a specific reason why I should definitely eat them blended?

It is advisable to be careful so that I do not eat too much.

I need to puree vegetables due to my circumstances.

How can I know if I'm eating too many vegetables?

Because there are differences among individuals, it is difficult to set a uniform standard of above or below a certain number of grams.

Choose a day to eat plenty of vegetables that you haven't eaten.

The amount I can eat when I do that is not too much for my body.

Remember that amount, and you can grind and consume just that much.

Sounds plausible, right?
