Reasons why severely obese individuals may not want to exercise.

Hello, this is pkang.

Over the past few videos, I have talked about dieting and exercise.

Regardless of the calories burned through exercise, the act of exercising itself holds significance.

If you take on a workout that is so difficult it's hard to continue, don't give up halfway.

I mentioned that it's good to do exercise that is somewhat challenging.

However, I don't like exercising. I don't want to exercise.

I see quite a lot of comments like this.

In this video, I would like to talk about the reasons why people don't want to exercise.

I made a video titled "If it's not fattening food, can you lose weight even if you eat a lot?"

In that video, we talked about appetite.

For those who haven't seen the video, let me briefly summarize the content.

In the case of a person who has a strong appetite and eats a lot of food, leading to obesity,

I think I eat a lot of food because I naturally have a strong appetite.

In fact, appetite is greatly influenced by the food we eat.

Eating processed refined foods can create false hunger, leading to increased appetite.

Because my appetite has increased, I need to eat a lot of food to feel satisfied.

If the amount of food you eat increases, you will likely become obese.

On the contrary, reducing the intake of processed foods will eliminate false hunger.

When false hunger disappears, appetite decreases.

Because my appetite has decreased, I feel satisfied even when I don't eat much.

If you don't eat a lot, you will naturally lose weight.

When looking at success stories about dieting, there are many mentions of the stomach shrinking.

They say that because their stomach has shrunk, they feel satisfied even without eating a lot.

In fact, this phenomenon occurs not because the stomach has shrunk, but because the appetite has decreased.

For those who are curious about more details on this, there is a link in the upper right corner.

You can click and take a look.

So I originally thought that I had a strong appetite and ate a lot of food, but...

The truth is that it was actually influenced by the food we eat.

The same goes for exercise.

"I originally dislike exercising." "I think I hate moving," but...

In fact, it is likely that it is being influenced by other factors.

There are various factors that can make someone dislike exercise.

The factor I will discuss in this video is weight.

To move a light object, a small amount of force is sufficient, but

To move a large object, a lot of force is needed.

So when you do weight training with heavy weights, your muscles develop.

However, this applies not only to exercise but also directly to body weight.

When you gain weight and your body becomes heavier, it requires a lot of effort to move your body.

To generate this strength, muscles inevitably develop.

So in the case of severe obesity with a high body weight,

Even if you have no exercise experience at all, the InBody measurement may show that you have a lot of muscle mass.

However, the muscles developed in this way are somewhat different from those developed through exercise.

To use muscles, oxygen and energy are needed.

Oxygen is supplied to the body through the lungs.

The oxygen and energy supplied to the lungs are delivered to the muscles through the blood.

This blood spreads throughout the body through the heart.

In order to properly use muscles, the capabilities of the heart and lungs need to be supported.

The ability of the heart and lungs is referred to as cardiopulmonary capacity.

When you build muscle through exercise, your cardiovascular capacity naturally develops during the process.

In cases where muscles develop while supporting a heavy body without exercise,

When cardiovascular capacity is not developed, only the muscles will develop.

There is an imbalance between muscle strength and cardiovascular ability.

Severe obesity makes it easier to become short of breath and causes the heart rate to increase significantly, even with the same level of activity.

This is because the cardiovascular capacity is lacking compared to the muscles.

However, if your body is gradually getting heavier and, in line with that, your muscle mass is slowly increasing,

As muscle mass increases, doesn't cardiovascular capacity also develop alongside it?

As the muscle mass increases, the required oxygen and energy must have also increased.

Yes, that's right.

It didn't happen overnight that I suddenly became severely obese; it took time and gradually led to obesity.

If the level of activity has been maintained, it is normal for cardiovascular capacity to also develop.

The problem is that in modern society, it is possible to not maintain an active lifestyle.

When traveling long distances, it is better to use public transportation or a car rather than walking or running.

When going up to the upper floor, I use the elevator instead of the stairs.

In this case, since gravity continues to act, the muscles that support the body will grow.

Due to low activity levels, cardiovascular capacity develops relatively less.

And as the imbalance between muscle and cardiovascular capacity worsens, the body tries to reduce activity levels more and more.

With my current cardiovascular ability, it's very difficult to move my body.

Doesn't the human body try to maintain balance?

The low level of physical activity has weakened your cardiovascular capacity, but if you reduce your activity even more, the imbalance will worsen.

Yes, that's right. The human body tries to maintain balance.

However, originally this is a response that balances things out.

In the past, humanity had to engage in activities such as gathering and hunting to obtain food.

Reducing activity means not engaging in hunting and gathering.

In other words, it means not seeking food.

If you don't find food, you will have to starve, and if you starve, you will lose weight and experience muscle loss.

When weight decreases and muscle loss occurs, the body becomes one that can be managed with the current level of cardiovascular capacity.

Then, you can increase your activity level again and engage in gathering and hunting.

On the contrary, continuing to be active without starving yourself also has the effect of maintaining balance.

Even if your cardiovascular capacity is lacking, if you keep being active, your cardiovascular ability will gradually improve.

So if you maintain your activity level, your body's cardiovascular capacity will adjust accordingly.

When you reduce your activity level and starve yourself, your body adjusts to your cardiovascular capacity.

However, in modern society, even if we reduce our activity levels, there is no problem in obtaining food.

So the imbalance is becoming more and more severe.

As the imbalance worsens, the burden on the heart and lungs increases when physical activity is increased.

From the body's perspective, it is trying to reduce activity levels even more.

If this continues to repeat,

I get the impression that I originally disliked being active or exercising.

There is an interesting experiment.

The human body moves in response to electrical signals from the brain.

It is possible to stimulate a specific part of the brain to induce certain behaviors.

For example, if you stimulate the brain area involved in raising the arm,

You can raise your arm.

In the experiment, a stimulus was applied to make the arm lift.

We concealed the fact that we provided stimuli to the experiment participants.

And I asked why they raised their arm.

Most of the participants responded, "I raised my arm because I wanted to raise it."

The reason for raising the arm is that it stimulates the brain.

The participants in the experiment, who were unaware of that fact, answered that I wanted it.

So when the brain feels a certain stimulus, I recognize it as something I want or...

Or about actions that I can't understand why I did them.

"Oh, this is what I wanted." It means to assign significance to it.

Then what happens when the brain sends signals like "do not increase activity" or "do not exercise"?

I recognize that I don't want to exercise.

The reason I don't want to exercise is that it makes me feel like it's something I want.

If I were to express this in words, it would be "I am originally lazy."

"I dislike moving."

"I don't like exercising." That's how it goes.

So, I wasn't born as a person who inherently dislikes exercise.

The situation I am in can make my body dislike exercise.

Then, what happens if the brain sends signals to "increase activity, exercise"?

Recognizing that I want to exercise

The reason I want to exercise is that I give it meaning because I wanted it.

So, a person who exercises regularly feels discomfort when they don't work out.

Actually, I was someone who hated exercising.

I lost weight from dieting, and since I consistently exercised,

Many people have changed to enjoy exercising.

I will summarize.

Feeling like you don't want to exercise right now is

You were not born as someone who hates exercise.

Currently, my body is not suitable for exercising, which is causing these physical reactions.

There is a high probability that you are perceiving this as something I don't want to do or are attributing meaning to it.

I hate exercising, but the thought of having to do it for a lifetime for the sake of dieting and health is really terrifying and dreadful.

There are quite a few people who think this way.

By balancing your body, you can develop a liking for exercise.

It's not something you have to endure and do for a lifetime even if you don't want to.

Exercising for about an hour a day can be a pleasant experience.

So what should I do?

The explanation is complicated, but the conclusion is always the same: you just need to follow a diet and exercise.

If you lose weight through diet, you no longer need the muscles that support your weight.

Muscles that are no longer needed will decrease in size.

By reducing weight and muscle like this, I can create a body that matches my cardiovascular capacity.

By improving my cardiovascular capacity through exercise, I can develop a level of cardiovascular fitness that suits my body.

At this time, there is no need to obsess over exercises that burn a lot of calories.

You can do exercises with a slightly challenging intensity that I can continue without giving up.

By balancing the body in that way, you naturally move on to more challenging exercises.

So far, the story has been about severe obesity, right?

I'm not severely obese, but I dislike exercising. Why is that?

In the next video, we will talk about people who are not severely obese.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure the next video appears on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not the one about reasons for not wanting to exercise, please wait a few more days as it is still being made.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
