Hello, this is pkang.

In this video, we will talk about the weight difference between muscle and fat.

In the past, muscle is much heavier than fat.

There was a saying that the weight difference is more than double.

So, by following the right diet and exercise, if you reduce body fat and increase muscle, then...

Light body fat has decreased, and heavy muscle has increased.

There were many comments saying that even though I had successfully lost weight, my weight could still increase.

At the same time, a photo titled "Same Weight, Different Feel" starts to trend on the internet.

Even with the same weight, if you have more muscle, your body shape looks good, but if you have more body fat, your body shape does not look good.

In other words, even if the number on the scale is low, if there is little muscle mass and a lot of body fat, it can appear as obesity.

Even if the number on the scale is high, if you have a lot of muscle mass and low body fat, you can still look slim.

Don't obsess over the numbers on the scale; focus on following a proper diet.

At the same time, a photo comparing 1 kg of muscle and 1 kg of fat also becomes popular on the internet.

Muscle is more than twice as heavy as fat.

Even with the same weight, the volume of fat is represented much larger.

However,

Recently, there has been a lot of talk about how the weight of fat and muscle is not that different.

Muscle is heavier than fat, but the difference is not significant, around 20%.

So when comparing 1 kg of muscle to 1 kg of fat, there is only this much difference.

In fact, when comparing the density of muscle and fat, there is roughly a 20% difference.

When comparing the weight of actual muscle to the weight of fat, it is true that there isn't a significant difference.

However, if this statement is true, one question arises.

If the weight of fat and muscle is not significantly different, then their volume would also not be significantly different.

When the weight is the same, there shouldn't be much difference whether there is more fat or more muscle.

In that case, the statement that you don't need to obsess over the number on the scale because muscle is heavier than fat becomes a lie.

So, in the end, is how much you weigh the most important thing?

To get straight to the point, that's not the case.

Because even though the weight of muscle and fat may not differ much,

The weight due to muscle and fat can vary significantly.

So it's not that one side is right and the other is wrong; rather, the reference points for the discussion are different.

First of all, there is a significant difference in weight between fat and muscle. The claim that there is more than a twofold difference is...

The weight that actually applies to the body, meaning it is based on changes in body weight.

The claim that there is little difference in weight between fat and muscle is

It is based purely on the weight of muscle and fat, not on body weight.

What this is about is

Muscles store energy in the form of glycogen.

This glycogen has the characteristic of being stored with water when it is stored.

If the amount of glycogen stored is high, the amount of water stored along with it also increases.

If the amount of glycogen stored is low, the amount of water stored along with it will also decrease.

Even if we don't exercise separately, our muscles are still being used in our daily lives.

So glycogen continues to be consumed.

The glycogen that is depleted in this way is replenished using carbohydrates as the raw material.

If you limit your carbohydrate intake, you won't be able to replenish the glycogen that has been used up.

So, if you limit carbohydrate intake, the amount of glycogen stored will decrease.

When the amount of glycogen stored decreases, the amount of water stored along with it will also decrease.

So, your weight will decrease by the amount of water lost.

However, the weight of the moisture that decreases at this time is quite heavy.

The weight of glycogen and the water stored with it can be understood through a simple diet.

It is a diet called ketogenic that extremely restricts carbohydrate intake.

It is a diet that severely restricts carbohydrates, inducing symptoms of carbohydrate deficiency in the body.

Because carbohydrates are restricted, the storage of glycogen decreases.

As glycogen and the stored water are released,

In the early stages of starting a diet, there is a characteristic of losing weight quite rapidly.

It's common to see reviews stating that people lost about 10 to 15 kg in the first month.

Most of the weight lost during this time is due to the weight of glycogen and water.

It's much heavier than I expected.

So excluding the glycogen and water stored in the muscles.

If we simply consider the weight of muscle, it is correct that the weight difference between muscle and fat is not significant.

However, including the weight of glycogen and water stored in the muscles.

How much weight does it actually increase? Based on this,

Weight gain due to muscle and fat can differ by more than double.

So, when body fat decreases and muscle mass increases, there can be cases where weight actually increases.

Just like in the photo, you can have a different feeling at the same weight. Even if the weight is high, you can still achieve a great body shape.

So, if you are following a proper diet and exercising, it is true that you don't need to obsess over the numbers on the scale.

Sounds plausible, right?
