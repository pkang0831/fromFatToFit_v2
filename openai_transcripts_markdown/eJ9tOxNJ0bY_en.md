This is the second video in the series about glutinous rice.

The first video presents the claim that brown rice is good for dieting and the opposing claim that one should not eat brown rice while dieting.

We talked about the reasons behind these two opposing claims.

If you're curious about the video content, you can click the video link in the top right corner to watch it.

The topic of this video is brown rice and health.

When talking about brown rice and health, the most frequently mentioned aspect is

It is arsenic, residual pesticides, and phytic acid.

Let's start by talking about arsenic.

Arsenic is a substance that was once used in poison and is highly toxic, and it is now classified as a Group 1 carcinogen.

However, it is not a substance that occurs naturally in brown rice.

During the cultivation process, it is absorbed into the brown rice.

The reason for the absorption is that there are arsenic components in the compost made from manure and in pesticides.

It accumulates in the soil and water, and is then absorbed into the brown rice.

In other words, all crops that use compost made from manure and pesticides can accumulate arsenic.

And pesticide residues are not a unique characteristic of only brown rice.

It is detected in all crops that use pesticides.

Arsenic and pesticides accumulate in the husk of brown rice.

They say that brown rice with the skin is bad, but white rice with the skin removed is okay.

It is true that there are a lot of pesticides and arsenic on the outer skin.

However, we need to consider whether this is a dangerous amount.

If we assume this is a dangerous amount, then vegetables without skins become even more dangerous foods.

Vegetables are also cultivated using pesticides, insecticides, and manure fertilizer, just like rice.

In this process, arsenic and residual pesticides accumulate.

So, arsenic and residual pesticides are detected in other crops as well, including brown rice.

It's hard to understand why other crops are fine but brown rice is not.

Vegetables are not a staple food, but rice is considered a staple, so it's said to be risky because people eat a lot of it.

Because of the word "stock"

When eating brown rice, it's easy to think that you're primarily consuming brown rice.

That's not actually the case.

Because half of brown rice is made up of water.

To make 300g of brown rice, you need about 130g of brown rice.

When we consider a meal based on one bowl of rice, we eat about 130g of brown rice.

The amount of vegetables eaten as side dishes is more than 130g.

Since it's a stock, it's hard to say that I eat the most brown rice.

Rather, I eat more vegetables.

Lastly, there is phytic acid.

As mentioned in the first video, phytic acid...

It is a substance that plants possess as a means to defend against predators.

When a predator eats the seeds

It has the effect of hindering digestion in order to be expelled without being digested.

It has the effect of forcibly being expelled by combining with the nutrients in the predator's body.

The nutrients released in this way become fertilizer and help promote plant growth.

Phytic acid is not a unique substance found only in brown rice.

It is a substance that plants possess to protect their bodies.

Seeds contain all the necessary substances.

If phytic acid is considered dangerous, then whole grains, nuts, and foods like brown rice and beans will also be deemed dangerous.

In fact, phytic acid is sometimes referred to as a unique toxin that plants possess.

There are diets that prohibit the consumption of grains altogether, citing the reason that one should not ingest poison.

However, phytic acid does not only have negative effects.

Phytic acid has the effect of binding with nutrients in the body and forcing their excretion.

Not all nutrients that combine are beneficial for the body.

Because harmful nutrients, like heavy metals, can also combine in the body.

There is also a beneficial effect of expelling heavy metals.

So it's true that brown rice has harmful components, but it's okay because it's not just brown rice that has those.

Since brown rice is rich in nutrients, is it good to eat brown rice for health?

It is true that brown rice is rich in nutrients.

However, it seems that the undesirable components of brown rice are not exclusive to brown rice itself.

The good nutrients in brown rice are not found only in brown rice.

You can sufficiently obtain the nutrients found in brown rice from other fruits and vegetables as well.

It is not necessary to eat brown rice for the sake of health.

To summarize,

Brown rice is not particularly good for health compared to other foods, nor is it particularly bad.

It's just one of the foods.

So, I dislike brown rice, and since it's said to be healthy, there's no need to force myself to eat it.

I like glutinous rice, but I've heard "it's toxic. It's bad for your health." There's no need to avoid it for that reason.

Sounds plausible, right?

Isn't the way to eat brown rice incorrect?

They say that chewing it well for a long time or eating it as sprouted brown rice can solve those problems.
