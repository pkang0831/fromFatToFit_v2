The topic of this video is "What happens if you only do low carbs without high fats?"

A question with the following content was posted in the comments.

"Isn't it enough for someone who naturally has a lot of body fat to just follow a low-carb diet without going high-fat?" you asked.

This question can be interpreted in two ways.

Is it necessary to consume a large amount of fat?

The second question is, if there is no need to consume a large amount of fat, why is it called a low-carb diet instead of a low-carb diet?

I will answer these two questions.

The first question is, "Is it necessary to forcefully consume a large amount of fat?"

The answer is "no."

When talking about a low-carb, high-fat diet, many people tend to think of a single type of diet.

It refers to any diet where the calories obtained from fat are greater than the calories obtained from carbohydrates.

You can think of it as a very large concept.

This concept includes various types of diets.

So, as I think, there is no need to forcefully consume a large amount of fat.

Reducing refined carbohydrates decreases carbohydrate intake.

In this case, even if you don't eat a lot of fat, it becomes relatively high, resulting in a low-carb, high-fat diet.

However, there are other diets that claim you should consume a large amount of fat.

This diet has a rule that you must consume a certain amount of grams of fat every day.

The reason I oppose this kind of diet is that

A person on a diet finds it difficult to stick to their meal plan.

At first, they eat it saying it's delicious, but then they react by saying, "It's greasy and makes me feel sick; I don't want to eat it."

However, the diet insists that you should eat even if you have to force yourself.

I'm looking for ways to eat less greasy food.

The most extreme method I have seen is...

I cut the butter into pill-sized pieces, freeze them, and swallow a butter pill every morning.

However, I am showing this kind of rejection from my body, and I believe that if I force myself to keep eating, it will cause problems.

In reality, many people experience health issues while following such a diet, leading them to visit a hospital and stop the diet.

So the answer to the question "Should you force yourself to eat a large amount of fat?" is "No."

Second question.

"If there is no need to forcefully consume a large amount of fat, then why is it called a low-carb, high-fat diet?"

"Can't we just call it a low-carb diet?"

This is to distinguish it from a low-calorie diet.

If you mention a low-carb diet to someone who is dieting,

Because there is a negative perception of fat.

I am trying to eat a salad diet composed only of fruits and vegetables, with most of the fat removed.

It's not that fruits or vegetables are bad.

It is a very good unrefined carbohydrate.

However, unrefined carbohydrates are characterized by their low calorie content.

If you compose your diet with just this, it will be a low-calorie diet.

A low-calorie diet cannot sufficiently supply the calories needed by the body.

You develop a hunger response and become more prone to gaining weight, increasing the likelihood of experiencing yo-yo dieting.

In order to meet the necessary calories for the body, it is important to consume a certain amount of fat.

It is labeled as "high fat."

However, there may be some people who find this puzzling.

"Isn't it natural that to lose weight, you need to eat less than the calories your body needs?"

"If you eat all the calories your body needs, how can you lose weight?"

"Is a low-calorie, starvation diet very harmful to our bodies?" There may be some people who have this curiosity.

There is a video I made earlier titled "The Reason Why Fasting Diets Are Unfair" for people like this.

How unhealthy starvation diets are for the body.

This is a video explaining how it is possible to lose weight while consuming all the calories your body needs.

The video link is displayed in the upper right corner, so if you haven't seen the video, you can click to watch it.

In summary, the reason it is called a low-carb high-fat diet instead of just a low-carb diet is because...

This is to prevent confusion with a low-calorie diet.

You understand, right?
