Hello, this is pkang.

This video is the second one about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about the various types of low-carb, high-fat diets.

In this video, I will discuss the important reasons for distinguishing between low-carb, high-fat diets.

Since the content continues from Part 1, it is recommended to watch the previous videos in order.

For those who haven't watched Part 1, the playlist link is available in the top right corner.

By clicking, you can watch the first part of the video in order.

At the end of Part 1 of the video, we talked about the existence of hybrid diets that are created by mixing different types of diets.

It is made in such a way that...

The ketogenic diet is a diet that induces a state of ketosis.

The Paleo diet is a lifelong diet for health.

It's fine as long as the diet has a specific name and it's recognized that these two are different diets.

However, people who are unaware that there are various types of diets simply refer to it as a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Then it becomes a sentence like the following.

A low-carb, high-fat diet is one that induces a state of ketosis.

A low-carb, high-fat diet is a lifelong diet for health.

In this case, both are using the term low-carb, high-fat diet.

I think people who are unaware that there are various types of low-carb, high-fat diets assume that they are talking about the same diet.

If this happens, combine the two sentences.

To maintain health, it is thought that a lifelong state of ketosis is achieved through a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.

A strange hybrid diet is created by mixing the ketogenic diet and the paleo diet.

The claim that a low-carb, high-fat diet is unhealthy mostly refers to this hybrid diet.

And it is true that this hybrid diet is not good for health.

As mentioned in the first part of the video, the state of ketosis is a kind of emergency situation due to a lack of carbohydrates.

If this state lasts for a long time, it is not good for your health.

So, the ketogenic diet has the condition that it should be followed for a short period of time.

People who talk about the ketogenic diet say that it's good to maintain ketosis continuously, right?

Unfortunately, in Korea, a hybrid diet is referred to as a ketogenic diet.

Many people say that this is what a ketogenic diet is.

However, the reason this diet is not a ketogenic diet is that the diet itself has a logical flaw.

The basic logic of a hybrid diet is that a state of ketosis is beneficial for health.

So maintaining this state is good for your health.

However, for this logic to be correct, carbohydrates themselves must be unhealthy.

The state of ketosis is beneficial for health, but carbohydrates can disrupt ketosis.

As a result, in a hybrid diet, carbohydrates are extremely restricted regardless of whether they are refined or unrefined.

The consumption of fruits is completely prohibited, and the intake of vegetables is only allowed in small amounts, limited to leafy greens.

In severe cases, protein and fat can replace carbohydrates.

There are cases where it is claimed that carbohydrates are not necessary to eat at all.

However, unrefined carbohydrates like vegetables and fruits contain not only carbohydrates but also a lot of vitamins and minerals.

Limiting the intake of vegetables and fruits also restricts the intake of vitamins and minerals.

If you become deficient in vitamins and minerals, other health issues may arise.

In this case, the theory that maintaining a state of ketosis is good for health will be broken.

To maintain a state of ketosis, carbohydrates must be extremely restricted.

To severely restrict carbohydrates, it is necessary to limit the intake of fruits and vegetables.

If this happens, it will lead to a deficiency in vitamins and minerals, which is not good for health.

A healthy state and a state of ketosis cannot coexist.

Sometimes people say that it's enough to just take supplements.

It is contradictory to say that a diet is healthy only if you have to take separate supplements.

The second error is the logical fallacy that fat can only be burned when in a state of ketosis.

First, to summarize the main argument, it is as follows:

When not in a state of ketosis, the body primarily metabolizes carbohydrates.

Because the metabolism is primarily focused on carbohydrates, body fat is not burned, leading to obesity.

When in a state of ketosis, the body primarily metabolizes fat.

Since the metabolism focuses on fat, body fat is burned, obesity is resolved, and health improves.

So, it is said that being in a state of ketosis, which primarily metabolizes fat, is good for health.

For this claim to be true, body fat must not be burned unless one is in a state of ketosis.

If body fat can be burned without entering a state of ketosis, then there would be no need to achieve ketosis.

A vegetarian diet that excludes animal products and consists only of plant-based foods primarily derives most of its calories from carbohydrates.

So, the intake of carbohydrates is quite high.

Then, a person who follows a vegetarian diet cannot enter a state of ketosis, right?

If a state of ketosis is required for body fat to be burned, then vegetarians should not be able to burn body fat.

Many people have successfully lost body fat and achieved their diet goals through vegetarianism.

So the logic that body fat can only be burned when in a state of ketosis is also broken.

You don't have to be in a state of ketosis for body fat to be burned.

Isn't it true that more body fat is burned? I've heard there are studies on that.

As mentioned in Part 1 of the video,

Some of the organs in the human body usually use carbohydrates as energy.

In a state of ketosis, where carbohydrates are scarce, the body can use body fat as energy.

Then, an organ that originally did not use body fat for energy starts using body fat as energy.

When in a state of ketosis, it is true that the amount of body fat used increases.

However, the fat loss effect that can be achieved from this is temporary.

Because I mentioned it in the stagnation video.

When the human body lacks certain nutrients, its absorption rate increases to compensate for the deficiency.

When there is a deficiency of carbohydrates, the absorption rate of food increases in order to supplement carbohydrates.

When the absorption rate increases, the amount absorbed by the body also increases, which leads to an increase in body fat.

When the increased body fat and the body fat reduced through ketosis reach a balance,

Body fat stops decreasing, which leads to a plateau.

In fact, among those who have been on a hybrid diet for a long time, many have experienced a plateau.

There are many questions related to that, right?

However, the unfortunate thing is that the basic principle of a hybrid diet is that you shouldn't eat carbohydrates.

Try to restrict carbohydrates more severely.

Or it tells you to limit your protein intake because glucose can be produced in your body through gluconeogenesis.

Then, the intake of carbohydrates was originally prohibited.

Since protein intake needs to be limited, meat consumption should also be reduced.

Then the only thing you can eat is fat, right? Like butter or oil...

A diet that suggests eating a little bit of vegetables, fruits, and meat while consuming a lot of butter or oil is...

No matter how you look at it, it can't be a healthy diet.

The reason for recommending a normal ketogenic diet instead of a hybrid diet for a short period is

This is because it has the effect of reducing body fat without posing a significant threat to health when done for a short period.

However, when it extends over a long period, the reduction in body fat disappears as the absorption rate increases.

The reason they say it's meaningless and that you should only do it for a short period is because the threat of health deteriorating only increases.

So, the ketogenic diet and the hybrid diet are different.

Ah.. it's so complicated.. Wouldn't it be better to just diet with a balanced diet?

Do I really need to follow a low-carb, high-fat diet?

In the next video, I will talk about this question.

There are currently two videos playing on the screen, and I will make sure that the next video appears on the right once it is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the low-carb, high-fat diet series, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
