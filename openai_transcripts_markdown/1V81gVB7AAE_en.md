Does fasting after 6 PM make you lose weight no matter what you eat?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I don't eat food after 6 PM. I'm doing an intermittent fasting diet that starts after 6 PM.

I saw a video where someone lost weight even after eating chicken, ramen, and cola.

Is it possible to achieve this just by fasting after 6 PM?

A comment was posted asking what principle makes it possible, if it is possible.

I would like to talk a bit.

First of all, the video mentioned in the question is

This is a vlog-style video where I try living a week on an intermittent fasting diet after 6 PM.

If you write down the times you ate and what foods you consumed over the course of a week,

On the first day, I eat pasta at 3:29 PM and waffles at 5:53 PM.

On the second day, I had gukbap at 9:40 AM.

After that, although the time is not mentioned, I visited a friend's store.

I eat noodle dishes, kimbap, ade, rice bowls, fried foods, and sushi.

On the third day, I had ramen at 12:35.

I eat waffles at 4:37 and kimchi stew at 5:30.

On the fourth day, I had jjimdak at 12:13.

At 5:15, I eat waffles, then I have ramen, and for dessert, I eat cherry tomatoes.

On the 5th day, at 11:52, I eat chicken, cheese balls, and cola, but I leave about 3 pieces of chicken.

At 5:25, I finished eating the chicken I left earlier.

After that, I eat ramen and have two more snacks for dessert.

On the 6th day, I had jjimdak with a carbonated drink at 12:43.

I eat yogurt with cereal at 5:31.

On the 7th day, we will have pork belly rice bowl, handmade dumplings, and pork cutlet at 12:39.

Finally, we eat pork belly at 5:35.

Looking at the food I ate over the past seven days...

Chicken, braised chicken, waffles, ramen, snacks, and carbonated drinks are foods that are far from a diet.

The amount of food eaten is not small either.

However, the result is a weight loss of 1kg.

Is it possible to lose weight even after eating like that?

Losing 1 kg a week isn't a small amount.

Is there a secret about the time 6 o'clock?

So if I fast after 6 PM, can I eat anything?

No, that's not the case.

That result was not solely due to fasting after 6 PM.

Fasting after 6 PM is good for dieting. The reason this statement has come about is...

When I said I go to sleep at 10 PM.

This is because the time that goes back 4 hours needed for food digestion is 6 o'clock.

So, if you finish all your meals by 6 o'clock, based on going to bed at 10 PM,

In four hours, my digestion will be complete and I will go to sleep.

This is good for dieting, right?

Simply put, not eating late-night snacks is good for dieting.

If we eat a late-night snack and go to sleep without digesting it,

I need to digest while I'm sleeping.

This causes confusion in hormone metabolism and makes it difficult to get a good night's sleep.

When there is a disruption in hormone metabolism, appetite control becomes difficult, leading to an increase in food intake.

If the amount of food increases, it is naturally not good for dieting.

Not getting enough sleep is also not good for dieting.

So, fasting after 6 PM ultimately means cutting out late-night snacks.

The weight loss effect that occurs when you stop late-night snacking is not enough to lose 1kg even if you eat like that.

Then why did I lose 1kg even though I ate so much?

It is because I ate a lot of food in a short period of time.

There is a diet called the Emperor's One Meal Diet, which is similar in approach.

Singer Hong Jin-young is famous for a diet she follows.

It is a diet method where you eat a lot of food that you want in just one meal a day.

Even if I only eat one meal a day, I eat a lot.

How does dieting work?

It's because there is a limit to digestion.

For example, if you put enough rice and water for 10 servings into a rice cooker designed for 3 people and cook it,

Since I put in rice and water for 10 servings, will it make 10 servings of rice?

Of course, it won't work.

It exceeds the capacity that a 3-person rice cooker can handle.

Everything in the world has a limit to its capacity, and

This is also true for the human digestive system.

If you drink a large amount of water at once, it won't be properly absorbed.

It is said that when drinking water, it's better to drink small amounts frequently.

If you eat a lot of food in a short period of time, based on the same concept,

That food is not being properly digested and absorbed.

I exceed the limit of what my body can digest.

So even if you eat a lot of food, if you eat it all in one meal,

It is possible to temporarily lose weight.

The problem is that this type of meal puts an enormous strain on the digestive system.

It can trigger binge eating disorder.

Temporarily, weight may decrease.

It means that there will be problems if done for a long time.

But that video doesn't show just one meal a day, does it?

Yes, that's right.

Except for the second day when I visited a friend's store.

Looking at the meal times for the remaining 6 days,

I always eat between 12 and 6 o'clock.

So, you ate all that food within 6 hours.

I didn't eat anything for the rest of the time.

This is similar to intermittent fasting, where you eat for 8 hours a day and fast for 16 hours.

And there has already been a similar debate regarding intermittent fasting.

When intermittent fasting was first introduced, most people focused on fasting for 16 hours.

So as long as you stick to a 16-hour fast,

There has been a claim that you can eat freely during an 8-hour meal window and still lose weight.

When you eat more calories than your daily metabolic rate.

If you eat without fasting for 16 hours, your weight will increase.

There is also an experiment that showed results indicating weight loss after a 16-hour fast.

Based on this experiment, if you simply fast for 16 hours, you can lose weight regardless of what and how you eat.

This is why such words have come about.

However, as mentioned earlier, this effect is temporary.

As time passes

I am practicing intermittent fasting, but my weight is actually increasing.

The amount of food consumed during the 8-hour meal period is gradually increasing.

There has been an increase in the number of people showing symptoms of binge eating.

Ultimately, this method of intermittent fasting is referred to as intermittent binge eating.

Intermittent fasting and intermittent binge eating are different, and they are distinguished from each other.

From then on, I should practice intermittent fasting. I must not engage in intermittent binge eating.

The 16 hours of fasting is important, but the 8 hours of eating is also important.

During the 8-hour eating window, one should consume high-quality food.

The total calories consumed during the 8-hour meal period should not exceed the daily metabolic rate.

Stories like this have started to emerge.

To summarize...

The essence of intermittent fasting after 6 PM is not eating late-night snacks.

Therefore, it has a similar diet effect to not eating a late-night snack.

If you don't eat late-night snacks, there will definitely be a dieting effect, but...

Eating a lot of things like chicken, ramen, and cola doesn't really lead to weight loss.

In the video mentioned in the question, the weight did decrease, but...

This is an effect that occurred because I ate a lot of food in a short period of time.

This method can temporarily reduce weight, but

It can put a strain on the digestive system, leading to health issues.

Because it can develop into binge eating disorder.

As time goes by, the effects of dieting diminish, and it often results in weight gain instead.

So just because you fast after 6 PM doesn't mean you can eat anything and still lose weight.

One of the reasons why eating late-night snacks is not good for dieting is that it disrupts deep sleep.

Is sleeping really that important for dieting?

Yes, it's important.

I previously made a video about how important sleep is for dieting.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will have a video about sleep playing in the top left.

If you're curious, you can click to see it.

Intermittent fasting mainly focuses on the fasting period.

I never thought that mealtime was important.

It seems to be much more important than I thought?

Please tell me more about intermittent fasting.

I previously created a series of videos about intermittent fasting.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right.

If you eat a lot of food in a short period of time, your stomach expands.

I feel like I might binge eat because of that.

Conversely, if you eat less food, your stomach will shrink.

When the stomach shrinks, you feel full even after eating just a little. There's that saying, right?

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure that a video about the line-reducing diet appears in the bottom left.
