Is it correct to say that it prevents muscles from gaining fat?

A question has come up, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the content of the question.

Mr. pkang, they say that exercise is important when dieting.

If you exercise to build muscle, your basal metabolic rate increases.

I understand that if your basal metabolic rate increases, you will have a body type that doesn't gain weight.

A friend said that people who make money through exercise are using deceptive marketing tactics to earn money.

Athletes have a lot of muscle because they have been exercising their whole lives.

If it prevents muscles from gaining fat,

The retired athlete could not refute the statement about why they gained weight.

I know an athlete who gained weight after retiring.

I think my friend's words might be right, but I'm a bit confused.

Is it true that it prevents muscles from gaining fat? Or is it just a marketing tactic?

This is a question about such content. Let's discuss it in detail.

First, let's talk about basal metabolic rate.

Even if we lie down and sleep all day without doing anything,

The heart beats, the lungs breathe, and the brain needs to think.

Energy is consumed in this process.

To maintain life in this way, the energy that is fundamentally consumed is called the basal metabolic rate.

Most of the basal metabolic rate is the energy consumed by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

The energy consumed by muscles in the basal metabolic rate is approximately 20%.

20% may seem like a lot, but it's 20% of all the muscles in the body combined.

When muscle increases by 1 kg, the basal metabolic rate increases by about 13 kcal.

If you really, really work out hard and increase your muscle mass by 10 kg,

The basal metabolic rate increases by about 130 kcal.

It's not a very large amount.

Even if muscle mass increases because of this, there is not a significant difference in the basal metabolic rate.

Increase muscle mass to boost basal metabolic rate.

The claim that you can have a body type that doesn't gain weight from that is a lie.

Such a story has come up.

So, is what the writer's friend said correct?

Does building muscle through exercise not have the effect of preventing weight gain?

No, that's not the case.

To move a large and powerful car, a high-performance engine is needed.

In the same concept.

To move a large, strong body with a lot of muscle, high-performance organs are needed.

Lungs that supply oxygen

Digestive organs that supply energy

Oxygen and energy are delivered to the muscles through the blood, and the heart supplies that blood.

The brain that manages and regulates the entire body.

In the process of exercising to develop muscles, these organs also develop alongside.

The proportion of muscle in the basal metabolic rate is about 20% of the total.

So even if the muscles develop, the increase in basal metabolic rate is not significant.

However, the organs account for 80% of the basal metabolic rate.

As such organs develop, the energy consumed increases.

Considering these points,

The increase in basal metabolic rate when muscle mass is increased through exercise is not so low that it is meaningless.

However, blood sugar is a bit more important than basal metabolic rate.

In the past, the cause of obesity was thought to be high calories.

Recently, high blood sugar is being recognized as a cause of obesity.

The carbohydrates we eat are converted into glucose in the body.

This glucose moves through the blood.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is referred to as blood sugar.

When the glucose in the blood increases, blood sugar levels rise.

When the glucose in the blood decreases, blood sugar levels drop.

If high blood sugar levels are maintained, inflammation occurs in the blood vessels.

When blood sugar levels rise, hormones that lower blood sugar are released.

It is a hormone called insulin.

Insulin helps to lower blood sugar levels that have risen due to carbohydrates, but it also...

It also helps in the use of protein for muscle synthesis.

It also works to store the fat we eat as body fat.

When we eat food and nutrients enter our bodies,

It's the hormone that processes that nutrient.

However, from a diet perspective, it is a hormone that increases body fat.

If blood sugar rises frequently, quickly, and significantly, insulin is released frequently, quickly, and in large amounts.

This leads to frequent, rapid, and significant accumulation of body fat, resulting in obesity.

So recently, in dieting, it is considered important to suppress the rise in blood sugar levels.

There are various ways to suppress the rise in blood sugar levels.

One of them is to build muscle through exercise and maintain an active lifestyle.

It is said that building muscle through exercise helps prevent weight gain.

So if that's true, why do retired athletes gain weight?

It is because they are unable to maintain their activity level.

When the glucose in the blood increases, blood sugar levels rise.

It was said that insulin lowers this blood sugar.

Insulin lowers blood sugar by storing glucose in the blood as glycogen and body fat.

Glycogen is an energy source made from glucose and is stored in the liver and muscles.

It is easier to store glucose as glycogen rather than as body fat.

If you can store a lot of glycogen, it is more advantageous for blood sugar control.

And it can also prevent glucose from being stored as body fat.

However, there is a limit to the amount of glycogen that can be stored.

It is also important to continue consuming stored glycogen.

You need to continuously create empty spaces by depleting stored glycogen.

You can use it to manage blood sugar when it rises during the next meal.

Exercising increases muscle mass and strengthens physical fitness.

As muscle mass increases, the amount of glycogen that can be stored also increases.

When muscles develop, strength increases and stamina becomes stronger.

It becomes easier to move your body.

When it becomes easier to move the body, the level of activity naturally increases.

This increased level of activity allows for continuous consumption of glycogen.

Athletes often struggle to maintain their activity levels after retirement.

That's the problem.

Why can't athletes maintain their activity levels?

The muscles and physical strength developed through exercise are generally greater in athletes than in the average person.

Yes, that's right.

However, there are also many injuries.

The general purpose of exercise for most people is health or beauty.

However, the purpose of an athlete training is to achieve good results.

In order to achieve good results, I push my body to the limit and exercise excessively.

Many players get injured because of this.

Many athletes also experience joint problems.

I have a lot of muscle in my body, so I can store a large amount of glycogen.

There are often cases of pain in the body due to injuries or issues with the joints.

That's why it's difficult to maintain an active lifestyle.

If you do not maintain your activity level, glycogen will not be properly utilized.

In this way, the effect of preventing muscle from gaining fat gradually decreases.

And when you exercise, muscle mass increases, but

If you don't exercise, your muscle mass gradually decreases.

If there is at least some level of activity, the muscles can be maintained to some extent because they are continuously used.

If you don't exercise and your activity level gradually decreases,

Eventually, the muscles will also decrease.

When muscle mass decreases, the basal metabolic rate also decreases.

In this case, gaining weight is inevitable. This is the problem.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

Most of the basal metabolic rate is the energy consumed by the organs.

It is true that the increase in basal metabolic rate from muscle is not significant.

As muscles develop through exercise, the organs also develop alongside them.

The increase in basal metabolic rate when building muscle through exercise is not so low as to be meaningless.

Second

Recently, diets have been placing more importance on blood sugar rather than calories.

Increasing muscle mass and maintaining activity levels helps with blood sugar management.

It is true that building muscle through exercise has the effect of preventing obesity.

Third

Athletes train to achieve records.

I exercise, even at the risk of damaging my body.

This often leads to injuries or problems with the joints.

So after retirement, many people do not exercise and their activity levels often decrease.

This can cause weight gain.

I can organize it like this.

For an average person, increasing muscle mass through exercise is

It helps with dieting and also prevents weight gain.

It's good to exercise.

When blood sugar rises and insulin is released, body fat increases.

By suppressing the rise in blood sugar, it can help with dieting and prevent weight gain, right?

You mentioned that there are various ways to suppress the rise in blood sugar.

Besides building muscle through exercise, what other methods are there?

One way is to create a diet consisting of foods that raise blood sugar less in the first place.

When blood sugar rises after eating food.

Using glucose in the blood as energy

There are ways to suppress the rise in blood sugar levels.

When eating foods that raise blood sugar, there is also a method of consuming vegetables or vinegar together.

I explained everything in detail in a video before.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

The video about foods that raise blood sugar less is in the top left.

The video showing the use of glucose in the blood as energy after a meal is in the upper right.

I will place the vegetables in the bottom left and the vinegar in the bottom right.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
