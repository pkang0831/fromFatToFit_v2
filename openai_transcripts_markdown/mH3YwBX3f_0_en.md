When I'm bored or feeling dull, I tend to keep eating something, and I want to change this.

A comment with this kind of content has been posted, so I would like to discuss it.

The reasons for frequently wanting to eat can be broadly divided into four categories.

The first is a hormone issue, the second is insufficient food intake, the third is a lack of nutrients, and the fourth is habits.

I have already talked about hormone issues, insufficient food intake, and nutrient deficiencies in other videos a few times.

According to the comments on the question, it seems that they are already addressing these three issues.

However, you say that you can't stand the boring moments and end up eating something.

In this case, it is likely a problem of habit.

When you receive a reward for a certain action,

You will develop a desire to repeat that behavior.

And when a specific behavior is repeated, that behavior becomes a habit.

Eating snacks can also become a habit.

In fact, it is quite easy to develop a habit of eating snacks.

Eating sweet foods makes me feel good, and

Eating spicy food feels like it relieves stress.

Eating food itself can be a reward.

Eating while watching movies, dramas, or animations.

Like eating snacks while using the computer.

The situation of eating food is mainly when I am doing something I like and enjoy.

There are many cases where eating food is connected to the experience.

The most important thing here is the reason for repeating the behavior.

Before it becomes a habit, repetition is done based on the purpose of obtaining a reward.

Once it becomes a habit, the act of repeating that behavior itself becomes the goal.

So before it becomes a habit,

When you are stressed at work

To relieve that stress, I went home after work and ate spicy food.

Once this becomes a habit

Even if I haven't been particularly stressed at work,

I feel a desire to eat spicy food when I get off work.

Is it that you want to eat snacks not because of another issue, but just out of habit?

Yes, that's right.

So, by changing the types of food we eat, we can address hormone issues.

Make sure to have enough meals so that you don't feel hungry.

Even if you balance the nutrients to ensure there are no deficiencies,

I have a constant desire to eat something because I'm feeling bored.

It's not that there's something lacking that makes me want to eat; rather, I just want to repeat the act of eating itself.

So how do we solve this?

The solution is simpler than you might think.

You can prepare tea or water and drink it whenever you feel like eating something.

As mentioned earlier,

The desire to eat habitually is about wanting to repeat the act of eating.

Since the act of eating is the purpose, it doesn't really matter what you eat.

It means that you can drink tea or water.

A person who usually eats snacks often

I heard that drinking a lot of water is good for dieting.

When you try to drink a lot of water, you may end up eating fewer snacks.

That's because I drank a lot of water and now my stomach is full.

When you're full, don't you feel like you don't want to eat snacks?

If someone doesn't want to eat snacks because they are already full, that person wouldn't have become obese in the first place.

The reason we become obese is that we overeat even when we are full.

I just had a filling meal, but I want to drink a sweet beverage, so I'm drinking it.

I just had a filling meal, but if there are snacks in front of me, I end up putting them in my mouth, which makes me gain weight.

One of the reasons many people fail at dieting in the first place is due to their cravings for food.

When you're on a diet and really want to eat cake.

Drinking 2 liters of water or eating a lot of salad doesn't eliminate the desire to eat cake.

Being full is one thing, but I still want to keep eating cake.

The human stomach is an elastic organ that can expand in size.

Even if you eat a lot of food to the point of filling up completely,

If there is a desire to eat more

The stomach expands to create space, allowing for more food to be consumed.

When you want a snack, drink water to fill your stomach.

That won't eliminate the desire for snacks.

Um... I don't quite understand.

If drinking water doesn't eliminate the craving for snacks, then why are we advised to drink water?

I mentioned it at the beginning of the video.

The reasons for wanting to snack can be broadly categorized into four main types.

Hormonal issues, insufficient food intake, nutrient deficiencies, habits.

Here, issues related to hormones, meal quantity, and nutrients become the reasons for needing food.

Therefore, just drinking water will not solve the problem.

There is a reason why food is needed, and it cannot be solved with water.

However, the issue with habits is not that food is needed.

The act of eating is the main purpose of repeating it.

In this case, it means that you can drink water instead of having a snack.

When there is only a habit problem without any other causes.

This can be resolved with water or tea.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

The reasons for wanting to eat the first snack can be broadly divided into four categories: hormones, meal size, nutrients, and habits.

There is no problem with the type, quantity, or nutritional balance of the second food being consumed.

If you're feeling bored and want to eat something because your mouth is feeling empty, you might find yourself looking for a snack.

It is likely to be a habitual issue.

In the case of the third habit issue

The food itself is not the goal; the purpose is to repeat the act of eating.

Therefore, it is possible to resolve it by drinking tea or water instead of food.

Simply put, prepare water or tea in a large tumbler.

It means that whenever you habitually want to eat something, you can just drink instead.

You don't have to drink so much that you feel full.

Just a simple sip or two is enough.

What if I still want to eat snacks even if I do that?

Then that means it's not a habit issue, but rather that there is another problem.

This means there are issues with hormones, meal quantity, and nutrients.

In this case, you need to adjust your diet a bit.

What does it mean to crave snacks due to hormones, meal quantity, and nutrient issues?

The food we eat affects the hormones in our bodies.

This can lead to a craving for snacks.

To be precise, it's not just a craving for snacks that arises.

I often develop a desire to eat a lot of food itself.

It's not that I need food and want to eat; it's because of a hormonal issue that I want to eat.

The issue with meal portions is that when the portions are insufficient, you feel hungry, which leads to a desire for snacks.

I want to diet, but I don't want to give up snacks.

So instead of eating snacks, it often happens that people reduce their meal portions like this.

The issue with nutrients arises when specific nutrients are restricted, such as limiting carbohydrates or fats.

As the desire for that nutrient increases, it talks about trying to fulfill that nutrient through snacks.

For example, if you severely restrict carbohydrates, you may start craving cakes that are high in carbohydrates.

When you restrict fat and end up with a calorie deficit, you start craving high-calorie foods like cake.

Here, hormonal issues are the biggest cause of obesity.

Issues with meal quantity and nutrients are a typical cause of improper dieting.

So, to diet correctly, you must address these three things.

What foods affect hormones and make you want to eat frequently and in large amounts?

To create a meal plan that does not have issues with portion size and nutrients, what should be done is

I explained it in detail in another video.

Even if you eat food to fill up the top in the middle of the video earlier,

You mentioned that if there is a desire to eat more food, the stomach expands to create space.

Is that really true?

Yes, it's true.

In fact, there have been instances on Korean TV broadcasts where the expansion of the stomach was shown.

There was a question about the size above in the past, and I talked about it in detail in a video answering that question.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right.

I know that snacks like bread, cookies, macarons, and chocolate are not good for me...

I love these foods so much that thinking about having to give them up feels really overwhelming.

You don't have to cut it off completely.

You can create a body that can enjoy bread, snacks, macarons, and chocolate.

The same question came up before, so I made a response video.
