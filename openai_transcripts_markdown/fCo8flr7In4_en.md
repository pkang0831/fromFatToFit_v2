If stress is a cause of obesity, what is the emotional struggle diet? - Stress Part 1

Hello, this is pkang.

Questions about stress and body fat have come up in the comments, so the topic of this video is stress.

A well-known fact about stress and dieting is that stress can lead to weight gain.

In the comments, it is mentioned that stress can lead to weight loss.

The process by which stress leads to weight gain.

Now, let's look at the situation where weight decreases when experiencing stress.

There are a wide variety of situations in which modern humanity experiences stress.

In the past, situations that caused stress for humanity were primarily life-threatening situations.

In such situations, the solutions can be broadly divided into two categories: struggle and escape.

Struggle is a way to secure safety by fighting and defeating enemies that threaten life.

Escape is quickly fleeing to secure safety in a life-threatening situation.

In stressful situations, the body's state changes in a way that favors this fight or flight response.

This is called the fight-or-flight response to stress.

Regardless of whether you choose struggle or escape, you need to actively utilize your muscles.

It mainly progresses in a way that allows the muscles to exert sufficient strength.

In stressful situations, a hormone called cortisol is released.

Cortisol raises blood sugar levels to secure energy for muscle use.

It induces rapid breathing to secure the oxygen that the muscles will use.

The secured oxygen and energy are delivered to the muscles through the blood.

It also has the effect of making the heart beat faster so that blood can flow quickly.

And after a dangerous situation has ended, it is necessary to replenish the energy that was urgently expended.

It increases appetite to encourage eating a lot of food and makes it easier for the consumed food to be stored as body fat.

The response of cortisol is certainly helpful in situations of fight or flight.

The problem is that most of the stress modern humanity experiences is not related to threats to life.

So, in the midst of struggle and escape, it means not choosing either.

Blood sugar was raised to favor struggle and escape.

If you do not take any action between struggle and escape, the elevated blood sugar will become unnecessary.

Insulin hormone is secreted to lower blood sugar levels.

Insulin lowers blood sugar by converting glucose in the blood into body fat for storage.

The insulin secreted to lower blood sugar becomes a cause of obesity.

All diet plans prohibit the consumption of foods that rapidly and significantly raise blood sugar levels.

However, my blood sugar levels are rising even though I haven't eaten.

The secretion of insulin to lower blood sugar is obviously not good for dieting.

And the more important point is the source of the glucose that raises blood sugar.

In a situation where food has not been consumed, in order to raise blood sugar levels, glucose must be obtained from somewhere in the body.

Some of the glucose that cortisol brings about is made by breaking down muscle.

So cortisol breaks down muscle to obtain glucose and raises blood sugar levels.

To lower elevated blood sugar levels, it is being converted and stored as body fat.

It's literally turning muscle into body fat.

To lose weight, you need to reduce body fat and increase muscle mass.

Because the exact opposite phenomenon occurs and happens.

Stress is a cause of obesity. When you are stressed, you gain weight.

That's how this story came about.

Considering everything so far, it seems that I should naturally gain weight when I am stressed.

In the comments, it was mentioned that weight decreases when one is stressed.

If the function of the stomach is impaired due to stress, this phenomenon can occur.

In fact, the brain and the gut are connected by a bundle of nerves known as the brain-gut axis.

Through this gut-brain axis, signals are exchanged, creating a relationship where they influence each other.

So when you eat in an uncomfortable situation, it can lead to indigestion and cause you to feel bloated.

When you experience a lot of stress, you may feel a burning sensation in your stomach.

In severe cases, even if there are no issues with the stomach itself, problems can arise with the stomach's ability to digest and absorb.

This is referred to as functional gastrointestinal disorder or neurogenic gastritis.

In such situations, even if you eat food, it may not be properly absorbed by your body.

On the contrary, a malfunctioning stomach can affect the brain and completely eliminate appetite.

Because the food is not digested or absorbed, or because one does not eat at all.

There will be a phenomenon of weight loss.

This is the emotional struggle diet.

If you eat but don't absorb it and your appetite decreases, it might seem good for dieting.

So, is it good for dieting to be under a lot of stress?

Of course, that's not the case.

Not having an appetite to the point of not eating at all, or even if you do eat, not being able to absorb the food means that

Essentially, it's no different from a low-calorie diet or a starvation diet.

Although weight may decrease for now, metabolic rate decreases and muscle mass diminishes.

There is a problem that the body can easily become prone to yo-yoing.

In the past, there were quite a few instances where fasting diets or low-calorie diets were recommended.

After it became known that having a body prone to yo-yo dieting ultimately hinders weight loss,

This type of diet method is not particularly recommended.

And except for some people whose digestive function deteriorates when they are stressed.

Most people gain weight when they are stressed.

It can't be said that experiencing a lot of stress is good for dieting.

They say that exercising puts stress on the body.

If stress is not good for dieting, does that mean exercise hinders dieting?

There are indeed such claims.

In the next video, I will talk about whether stress from exercise interferes with dieting.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the right leg video is not the stress part 2 video, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making the video.
