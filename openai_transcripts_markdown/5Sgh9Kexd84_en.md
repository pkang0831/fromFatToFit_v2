I'm eating unrefined foods that reduce appetite, but I'm still feeling hungry. Why is this happening?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

The reason we become obese is that we eat too much food.

The reason for overeating is that refined foods have increased appetite.

If you reduce refined foods and eat unrefined foods,

As appetite returns to normal, the amount of food intake decreases, making it easier to lose weight.

This is the most fundamental aspect of the diet I am talking about.

However, even though I eat unprocessed foods, I still feel hungry and eat too much.

I saw a comment with this kind of content.

In this video, I would like to talk about why such phenomena occur.

First of all, for those who are new to my videos, let me explain what refined and unrefined foods are.

Why does eating processed foods increase appetite?

You probably don't know why eating unrefined foods normalizes appetite.

I will make sure to have a detailed explanatory video available in the upper right.

If you're curious, you can click and take a look.

If you are eating unprocessed foods but still feel hungry or are eating a lot,

In most cases, there is a problem with dietary balance.

For example, I am eating vegetables, chicken breast, and brown rice.

There are comments saying that they often feel hungry because they don't maintain a sense of fullness, and as a result, they eat a lot.

What might this person be lacking?

It is fat.

Vegetables and brown rice contain very little fat.

Chicken breast is synonymous with lean meat.

So, you are intentionally limiting the amount of fat you consume.

This is the problem.

From the body's perspective, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are all necessary.

Since fat is needed, but fat intake is restricted, signals to eat fat are being sent out.

Because of that signal, you continue to feel hungry, which leads you to eat a lot of food.

This phenomenon applies not only to fats but also directly to carbohydrates and proteins.

Actually, those who have watched my videos while following a low-carb, high-fat diet...

There is a tendency to try to eat as few carbohydrates as possible.

In this case, because there is a lack of carbohydrates, you often feel hungry and tend to eat a lot.

So does that mean I need to balance carbohydrates, fats, and proteins every time I eat?

It's not that; it's about the overall direction.

Some days, I crave a lot of meat, so I eat a lot of protein and fat.

Some days, I didn't want to eat meat at all, so I didn't consume any protein.

Some days, I mix vegetables into my rice and eat it, so I consume a lot of carbohydrates.

It's not a problem to eat like this.

Just because a single meal is unbalanced doesn't mean that a problem will arise immediately.

Today, I focused on eating carbohydrates, so I consumed a lot of carbs while eating less protein and fat.

Tomorrow, if I eat fewer carbohydrates and consume more protein and fat, then...

Ultimately, from a broader perspective, everything balances out.

This won't be a problem.

However, if you structure your diet with the intention of limiting fat intake,

Today, tomorrow, a month from now, and a year from now, I will continue to follow a diet that is low in fat.

This means that there will be problems due to a lack of fat.

Now that we know the cause of the problem, let's try to find a solution.

Check what I am restricting or what is relatively lacking in my diet.

You can check your body's reaction when you eat it.

For example, if you were limiting your intake of fats,

Try adding about one to two tablespoons of fats that can be consumed directly, like olive oil.

You can check your body's reaction when you eat like that.

After eating olive oil, I feel full even when I eat less than usual.

If the feeling of fullness lasts for a long time,

I have been lacking fat in my diet, and because of that, I have been feeling hungry continuously.

So from now on, you can add fats to your diet.

If you were restricting carbohydrates with the same concept, you can try eating about 100g of carbohydrate foods.

You can eat one medium-sized potato or sweet potato, or you can have 100g of brown rice.

Olive oil is about one to two tablespoons, which is approximately 5 to 10 grams.

Why do we eat carbohydrates in 100g portions?

In the case of olive oil, the olives are pressed to extract only the fat.

So, 5 to 10 grams is all fat.

On the other hand, carbohydrate foods like potatoes, sweet potatoes, and brown rice are not entirely made up of carbohydrates in 100g.

In 100g of potatoes, sweet potatoes, or brown rice, there are about 20 to 30g of carbohydrates.

And among them, there are also dietary fibers that are not digestible.

The actual amount of carbohydrates consumed is less than 20 to 30 grams.

So, you need to eat about 100g of potatoes, sweet potatoes, or brown rice to match the amount of 5-10g of oil.

So that's how you eat it.

I will summarize.

Eating unprocessed foods has normalized my appetite.

If you are not feeling full and are constantly hungry or eating too much food,

There is a problem with the diet I am currently following.

Since my appetite has returned to normal, it signals if there is a problem with my diet.

Think about what might be lacking in my diet.

You need to check what kind of reactions occur in your body when you eat something insufficient.

Dieting is something I do with my body.

So don't ignore the signals from my body.

It means that I need to have a conversation with my body.

You need to do it that way to avoid any issues.

Thanks to you, my diet is going well. I've lost about 10 kg.

It doesn't show much on the surface.

Others seem to look completely different after losing 10kg, but why am I like this?

It is due to the rate of change and the blindness to change.

There was a question that came up before, so I made a video explaining it in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos appear on the left.

If you have the same concerns, you can click here to see.

Can you tell me the signs that indicate whether my diet is going well and the order in which I will lose weight?

I used to create a video series that explained the process of losing weight in detail.

I think you will find that video helpful.

I will make sure to have a video about the process of losing weight on the right side.
