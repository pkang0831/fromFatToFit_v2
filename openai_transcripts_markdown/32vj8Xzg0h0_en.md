Hello, this is pkang. Today, I have a brief announcement video.

Recently, there have been comments saying that the microphone is too loud, making it hard to understand.

I noticed it a lot, so I changed the microphone.

I feel that the sound reverberation is much more pronounced compared to the microphone I used to use.

It has decreased, and it feels a bit cleaner.

I hope our readers will feel the same way. So, moving forward with the videos...

I hope it is a bit more comfortable for you to look at.

Oh, today's announcement is that we will be accepting applications for remakes.

If you look at the videos I made in the early days, you'll see that there are videos with voice modulation.

There are a lot of them, so at first, I made a video while hanging a male band line.

Now, many people are requesting that it would be nice if voice-to-text apps were more convenient.

At some point, I started to untangle the flat wire and began making videos.

Oh, I recently watched a video and subscribed, and when I saw the first video, there was voice modulation.

Because of this, it has become increasingly difficult, and more people are experiencing this.

I am thinking about remaking some of my old videos.

However, when I suggested remaking all the videos with voice modulation, it felt too repetitive.

I think there might be subscribers who dislike seeing repetitive content.

I received a request for a remake, and I'm considering focusing mainly on videos that have a lot of requests.

There are some videos that are carefully selected from my previous videos, which are inconvenient to watch every week.

Since there is too much content to discuss in video 1, the information is...

If you request a long and complex video that is a bit difficult to discuss, I will provide it by topic.

Please split the video and re-upload it with the voice remade in a voice that hasn't been spoken first.

I will do it.

The fact that it's only going to be uploaded as a remake from now on, just because I'm making a remake video...

No, it's a mix of remake videos and new videos, so it's blended together like this.

You don't need to worry about that part since I plan to upload it.

The application method has been remade, so please write the titles of the videos in the comments, or alternatively,

If there are already comments that have been submitted, you can just click the recommend button there.

Then, I will focus on remaking videos that have a lot of requests or recommendations.

Oh, please just acknowledge that, and I will return with the next video.

Thank you.
