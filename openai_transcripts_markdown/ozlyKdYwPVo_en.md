Reasons why losing weight by starving is not advisable. Basal metabolic rate Part 4.

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the fourth video about basal metabolic rate.

In the first part of the video, we discussed research indicating that even when losing weight through starvation, the basal metabolic rate does not decrease.

In the second part of the video, we discussed the claim that even with a starvation diet, muscle loss does not occur.

In the third part of the video, we discussed the reasons why people who follow starvation diets keep emerging.

In this video, I will talk about someone who lost weight by starving but does not experience yo-yo dieting.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it is recommended to watch it in order starting from Part 1.

For those who haven't seen the previous video, a link is appearing in the top right corner.

You can click and view them in order.

In the previous video, it was mentioned that if you follow a starvation diet or a low-calorie diet,

To protect the basal metabolic rate, the activity metabolic rate and exercise metabolic rate decrease.

When the basal metabolic rate and exercise metabolic rate decrease, the total amount of energy consumed in a day also decreases.

It was said that when you eat the same amount of food, your body can become more prone to gaining weight.

However, reduce the amount of food you eat to match the total amount of energy decreased.

If you continue to eat small amounts of food, it is possible to maintain your weight.

There are people who actually lose weight by starving themselves and then manage their weight with a low-calorie diet.

People like this can maintain their weight without experiencing yo-yo effects.

It may be easy to think that there are no problems because there is no yo-yo effect.

The truth is, that's not the case.

Basal metabolic rate is essential for maintaining life.

Even in situations where energy is lacking, there is a response to protect.

If you follow a low-calorie diet for a long time, your metabolism will gradually decrease.

You mentioned that a decrease in basal metabolic rate and exercise metabolic rate can lead to muscle loss.

Does that mean that muscle loss leads to a decrease in basal metabolic rate?

That's not the kind of story.

The proportion of muscle in the basal metabolic rate is about 20% of the total.

Even if muscle loss occurs, it doesn't mean that all the muscle is gone; only a portion is lost.

The decrease in basal metabolic rate due to muscle loss is not as significant as one might think.

The reason for the decrease in basal metabolic rate is that the functions of the major organs, which account for the remaining 80%, are declining.

To use muscles, oxygen and energy are required.

Oxygen is supplied to the body through the lungs, and oxygen and energy are delivered to the muscles via the blood.

The heart is responsible for sending this blood to the muscles.

If you exercise a lot and use your muscles extensively, your muscles will consume a lot of oxygen and energy.

As you use your heart and lungs more, your cardiovascular capacity naturally increases.

On the contrary, if the level of activity and exercise decreases, and muscles are not used properly, then...

As muscle loss occurs, the functions of the heart and lungs will also decline.

And if you continue to eat less food, your digestive system will also not be used properly.

If this situation continues, the function of the digestive system will gradually decline.

Other pieces also go through a similar process.

When the functions of major organs decline like this, the basal metabolic rate decreases.

The problem does not end here.

The fat that we commonly refer to as body fat can be broadly divided into two types: visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat refers to the fat that is located right next to the internal organs.

Because it is close to the intestines, it has characteristics that make it suitable for energy utilization.

It is fat that primarily serves as an energy storage, playing the role of supplying energy.

On the contrary, subcutaneous fat refers to the fat located just beneath the skin.

It is fat that is difficult to utilize as energy because it is far from the intestines.

Instead, the fat is spread throughout the body in a way that wraps around the muscles.

It is fat that protects the body from external shocks and serves the role of keeping body temperature warm.

Humans are warm-blooded animals that need to maintain a constant body temperature.

However, there is a characteristic that using muscles generates heat.

People with a lot of muscle and high activity levels generate a lot of heat in their bodies.

To maintain body temperature, you need to release this heat outside of your body.

However, if there is a lot of subcutaneous fat with insulation properties, it would be difficult to release heat.

So, a person with a lot of muscle mass and high activity levels has a response to reduce subcutaneous fat.

On the contrary, a person with low muscle mass and low activity levels generates less heat in their body.

To maintain body temperature with minimal heat, it is necessary to insulate so that the heat does not escape.

So, a person with low muscle mass and activity levels has a response that increases subcutaneous fat.

Due to this, men with a lot of muscle often have a higher prevalence of visceral fat obesity.

Women with low muscle mass primarily experience subcutaneous fat obesity.

So what happens if you follow a low-calorie diet and experience muscle loss, along with a decrease in activity and exercise levels?

Muscle mass decreases while subcutaneous fat increases.

Muscle is denser than body fat, which is why it is heavier.

So when muscle mass decreases and subcutaneous fat increases, body weight can actually decrease.

If this situation repeats, my weight will gradually decrease, leading to a thin body weight.

Subcutaneous fat tends to increase over time.

A body that has a low weight but a high amount of subcutaneous fat is referred to as "skinny fat."

So, if you lose weight by starving yourself and then maintain a low-calorie diet...

While I can maintain my weight, my body is gradually becoming thin but obese.

Subcutaneous fat is located outside of the muscles, so the muscles cannot hold it in place.

If there is an increase in body fat because of this, the skin will sag and become flabby due to gravity.

Visceral fat has a much more negative impact on health, but from a cosmetic perspective, subcutaneous fat is a much bigger issue.

So when body fat increases, I decide to go on a diet again.

In the past, I had experiences of easily dieting through starvation diets or low-calorie meal plans.

You will choose to go on a starvation diet again or opt for a low-calorie diet.

The problem is that the situation is completely different from back then.

In the past, the body's response to reduce body fat was stronger.

It was easy to obtain energy from body fat.

It's not like that right now.

If there is a lot of body fat, the body itself has a strong response to try to reduce body fat, right?

Why is the response to reduce body fat weak in individuals with skinny obesity, who have a high amount of body fat?

It is because it is subcutaneous fat that has been accumulated to maintain body temperature.

In the first place, it was said that subcutaneous fat is difficult to utilize as energy because it is far from the intestines.

And since I am on a low-calorie diet, my muscle mass has decreased and my activity level has dropped.

To maintain body temperature, this subcutaneous fat is essential.

So it doesn't really shrink well.

So right now, both the basal metabolic rate and the exercise metabolic rate are already in a lowered state.

To protect the basal metabolic rate, there are no other metabolic rates that can be lowered.

Extracting energy from body fat is not an easy situation either.

In such a situation, if you try to diet by reducing the amount of food you eat,

There is no other way than to lower the basal metabolic rate.

However, since I have been on a low-calorie diet for a long time, my basal metabolic rate has already decreased.

If you lower your basal metabolic rate any further here, it can really put your life in danger.

So the signals that indicate the need for food become very strong.

This makes my appetite extremely strong.

In the past, I didn't find it very difficult to follow a low-calorie diet or to fast, and I was able to endure it quite well.

This time, it's really hard to endure.

The bigger problem is that even after enduring so much difficulty, the weight doesn't seem to decrease well.

This is something that was discussed in the third part of the video on basal metabolic rate.

Following a low-calorie diet or fasting means eating little to no carbohydrates and salt.

Carbohydrates and salt have the effect of retaining body water.

If you eat less carbohydrates and salt or avoid them altogether, body fluids will be lost.

When body water is lost, body weight will decrease by that amount.

And if you eat less or do not eat at all, the amount of food and waste in the stomach decreases.

As this decreases, your weight will also decrease accordingly.

So when you first start a fasting diet or a low-calorie diet, there is a phenomenon where your weight drops very quickly.

However, if you lost weight by starving yourself and then continued to manage your diet with a low-calorie meal plan,

The amount of carbohydrates and salt that I was originally consuming is low, so the amount of body water retained is not much.

Because the amount of food consumed is small, the quantity of food and waste in the stomach is not large.

In this situation, even if you starve, your weight won't decrease.

The amount of body fluids, food, and feces that can be excreted has always been low.

My appetite has increased, making it harder to diet, but my weight isn't decreasing at all.

At this point, you will finally become aware that something is wrong with your body.

The weight is clearly normal or underweight, but on the outside, it appears to be obese.

I starved myself to lose weight, but unlike before, my weight isn't decreasing well.

My appetite has become very strong, and I've developed cravings that I didn't have before.

I will summarize.

With starvation diets and low-calorie diets, problems do not arise immediately.

Problems have accumulated over a long period, and ultimately, it has exploded.

You might think it's okay because you don't feel an immediate problem, but...

In fact, it's not like that, so it's better to avoid it if possible.

I am someone who has lost weight by starving myself and managing with a low-calorie diet, and a lot of time has already passed.

I didn't have much of a craving for food before.

Right now, my cravings have become so strong that it's difficult, and I'm also feeling a lot of stress.

I want to follow a diet, but it seems like I can't digest food well even when I eat.

The desire to eat foods like ice cream or cake is so strong that it's hard to stick to my diet.

When I went to the hospital, they said my digestive system wasn't doing well and advised me to eat soft foods.

Mr. pkang said that foods like that are quickly digested and absorbed, so they are fattening foods.

What should I do?

In the next video, we will discuss this question.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure the next video appears on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not the video for the basal metabolic rate part 5, please wait a few more days as it is still being made.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
