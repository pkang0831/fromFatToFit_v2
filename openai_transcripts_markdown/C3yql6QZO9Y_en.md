A woman who weighed 42 kg but became 62 kg after a car accident.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I'm not sure how to start my diet or which direction to take.

I received a story with this kind of content, and I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the content of the story.

I am a woman who is 152 cm tall.

I had some weight during high school, but I lost it after starting my job.

I tend to sleep in a lot in the morning.

Since middle and high school, I took a taxi to school in the morning.

I walked home from school.

As I started working, the distance between my home and workplace increased, resulting in a longer commute.

I walked the distance that takes about 40 to 50 minutes by bus when I got off work.

I have lost weight and now weigh around 42 to 45 kg.

At that time, I don't think my eating habits were to eat a lot.

I think the principle was to eat the food I want, but to eat only as much as I can.

At the age of 24, I was hospitalized in the intensive care unit due to a car accident, and my weight when I left the ICU was 40 kg.

After that, I spent more time in the hospital before being discharged.

The clothes I wore when I was admitted did not fit when I was discharged.

I came home wearing sweatpants because my thighs wouldn't fit.

At that time, the weight I remember is 52 kg.

Two years later, my weight had reached 62 kg.

At that time, I remember eating a lot and consuming a lot of fast food.

After that, I attended swimming lessons for about 3 to 4 years.

Thanks to swimming, it's not so much that moving my body or walking is difficult, but rather...

Due to the aftereffects of a traffic accident, my leg is uncomfortable, which feels a bit bothersome.

I have moved now and can no longer go to the swimming pool.

My weight is the same at 62kg, but I can feel that my body is gradually getting bigger.

My body feels heavy, I don't want to move, and it's tough.

I haven't exercised for nearly 10 years, and even when I did, I only did it a few times before stopping.

The diet was mainly focused on binge eating.

I relied on medication for my diet as well.

I tried both traditional medicine and Western medicine about five times.

I lost weight down to 52 kg just once, but then I returned to 62 kg.

The remaining four did not experience any weight change even after taking the medication.

These days, my eating pattern is such that I often skip breakfast because I'm too lazy to eat.

For lunch, I usually order food for delivery and tend to leave some leftovers.

If there's something delicious for dinner, I'll eat it.

If there's nothing tasty, if I'm feeling lazy, and if I'm not really hungry, I just skip eating.

Then, I usually eat chicken late in the evening.

When I don't eat delivery food, I only eat about half of a small bowl.

I was thinking of getting a personal trainer to start exercising.

Because my leg is not in good condition, you said you would just walk with me.

In that process, I gave up after demanding 1.5 million won with the condition of working twice a week.

I want to lose weight.

I want to find balance again.

But I don't know how to start.

When I eat less, I don't eat a lot, but my weight still doesn't go down.

Have you ever thought that you really need to eat nothing to lose weight?

For about four days a week, the amount I eat is very small.

On days when I have a late-night snack or go out to eat, I finish an entire serving by myself.

I am not writing to ask for everything to be explained.

I want to know what direction I should take to achieve physical changes.

Where should I start? What direction should I take?

Since I don't know the starting point or the direction, it's difficult to ask questions.

No matter where I ask, whether it's a gym or a fitness center, I can't seem to get a clear answer.

The hospital tells me to diet, but all they talk about is diet pills and injections.

I'm so frustrated.

This is a story with that content.

If we divide the story into four main parts,

It can be divided into before the traffic accident, after the traffic accident, after quitting the swimming pool, and now.

If we look at how eating habits and lifestyle habits have changed in each part,

You can understand what the problem is and what needs to be done.

The narrator before the traffic accident

When eating, if I felt full, I was someone who could stop the meal even if there was food left.

It means that I was able to control my appetite and the amount of food I ate by myself.

And I had enough activity to walk home from work, which takes about 40 to 50 minutes by bus.

If I had this level of activity,

I believe there was a certain level of activity in daily life as well.

I maintained a weight of 42 to 45 kg by controlling my appetite and meal portions, as well as my activity level.

However, this will change after the traffic accident.

When I was discharged from the intensive care unit, my weight was 40 kg.

During my hospital stay, my weight increased to 52 kg.

I gained weight up to 62 kg within two years after being discharged.

The reason this happened is due to the two factors that helped maintain my weight.

This is because appetite, meal quantity, and activity levels have all changed.

During my hospital stay, my level of activity naturally decreased.

Moreover, the types of food being consumed are mainly fast food, and the portion sizes have also increased.

It's natural for weight to increase.

They said they went to the swimming pool for 3 to 4 years after being discharged. Wouldn't that have helped restore their activity level?

In the case of the person sharing their story, they injured their leg in a traffic accident.

In this case, activities are possible in places like a swimming pool where buoyancy supports the body, but...

When I come out of the water and go about my daily life, my uncomfortable leg hinders my movement.

So it's not easy to increase my activity level again.

I think there wasn't much physical activity except for the time spent swimming.

In reality, after moving away from the swimming pool, I became unable to go to the pool.

I haven't done any other exercise for 10 years.

It seems that it is uncomfortable and difficult to move on land rather than in water.

So, just like before the traffic accident.

While being able to control appetite and meal portions on your own,

I need to get my body back to a state of high activity.

To do that, you first need to improve your eating habits.

But didn't you say in another video that exercise is important for women's diets?

Yes, that's right.

The body fat in our body can be broadly divided into two types: visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

In the case of men, body fat primarily accumulates as visceral fat.

In the case of women, body fat primarily accumulates as subcutaneous fat.

It is a phenomenon that occurs because men's bodies and women's bodies are different.

In the case of visceral fat, it is located right next to the organs, making it easy to utilize as energy.

So when you are on a diet, it is effective for losing fat, but...

Subcutaneous fat is the fat located just beneath the skin.

Except for the skin, it is located on the outermost part of the body and is scattered throughout the entire body.

It is fat that is difficult to utilize for energy.

So, it's the fat that is effectively lost when you exercise rather than focusing on diet.

So the woman said that exercise is important.

However, in order to achieve the effects of exercise, it is necessary to first improve your eating habits.

Carbohydrates provide glycogen, which is the energy needed for exercise.

When protein is used as a material for muscle synthesis during the effects of exercise, it contributes to muscle growth.

The calories from fat help maintain daily metabolic rate.

In addition to that, cholesterol in fat serves as a building block for various hormones.

Vitamins and minerals in vegetables are also very important.

First, a proper diet should be established, and then exercise should follow for effective results.

Exercising alone will not yield results if your eating habits are in disarray.

In fact, the person has been swimming for 3 to 4 years, but there hasn't been any significant change.

This was because my eating habits were a mess at that time.

That's why there's a saying that eating is also a form of exercise.

Let's improve our eating habits now.

Looking at the eating patterns, I skip breakfast because it's too much trouble.

I ordered delivery food for lunch.

I often skip dinner and end up ordering delivery food for a late dinner.

Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late dinner are all interconnected and influence each other.

If you eat a late dinner the night before and go to bed, you will feel bloated the next morning.

I am tired and lacking energy because I am not getting proper sleep.

Because of this, I didn't want to eat breakfast, so I didn't eat.

Since I don't eat breakfast, I feel weak and very hungry by lunchtime.

I don't have the energy to prepare food myself, but I'm really hungry.

I find delivery food that I can eat right away without needing to prepare anything.

I need to diet, but I had delivery food for lunch.

Because of that guilt, I was trying not to have dinner.

I start to feel hungry late in the evening.

Since I already had spicy delivery food for lunch,

You end up craving that kind of food even late at night.

If you eat delivery food late at night, you'll probably skip breakfast the next morning.

We need to break this vicious cycle.

First, you need to stop skipping breakfast.

No matter how tired and weak you feel in the morning, make sure to have a meal.

If you eat even a little in the morning, you'll gain energy proportional to what you eat.

The hunger felt at lunchtime tends to decrease.

This way, I will have some free time for lunch, so I might not have to eat delivery food.

As my hunger decreases, I don't really feel like eating food quickly either.

Since I have gained a bit of strength, I can use that strength to make and eat it myself.

If you didn't eat delivery food for lunch, there's no reason to feel guilty about dinner.

Then there's no need to skip dinner.

If you eat dinner without skipping it, you won't feel hungry late at night, so you won't end up eating.

If you don't eat a late dinner, you won't feel tired or have an upset stomach the next morning.

It becomes easier to have breakfast.

First of all, it is important to create this virtuous cycle.

But in another video, you said that if you're not hungry, you don't have to eat.

Yes, that's right.

However, like the person in the story, not having breakfast made me feel very hungry by lunchtime.

Not having dinner makes me feel very hungry late in the evening.

It's not that I'm not hungry. I'm actually hungry.

It's just that the times I'm hungry don't match my lifestyle pattern.

In this case, I intentionally eat a little earlier so that I'm not hungry.

You need to adjust it so that you feel hungry at a time that is convenient for me to eat.

The idea that you don't have to eat if you're not hungry means that...

What I'm saying is not to force yourself to eat when you're not hungry and don't need food.

It's not that you should absolutely not eat if you're not hungry because it will cause some big problems.

When I don't eat delivery food, I only eat about half of a small bowl of rice.

Usually, I don't finish a whole serving.

When it's time to go out to eat because of a promise, I see the content about eating one serving.

I am eating delivery food, but I think I'm not eating a large amount.

So, "Why am I not losing weight when I eat so little?"

Do I have to starve myself to lose weight? This is the question I have.

As mentioned earlier,

In the case of women, body fat tends to accumulate primarily as subcutaneous fat.

This subcutaneous fat protects the body from external shocks and helps to retain body heat to prevent heat loss.

Humans are warm-blooded animals that need to maintain a body temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius.

If you cannot maintain your body temperature, survival is impossible.

Therefore, in order to raise body temperature, energy is continuously used.

At the same time, it uses subcutaneous fat to retain heat so that body temperature is not lost.

When the amount of food intake is reduced, the energy entering the body decreases.

We need to conserve the energy used to raise body temperature.

To achieve that, the need for subcutaneous fat to keep the body warm without losing body temperature increases.

The less you eat, the greater the need for subcutaneous fat becomes.

Then, of course, body fat won't come off easily.

Therefore, you should not try to eat very little or starve yourself.

Lastly, I am currently in a situation where my leg is uncomfortable due to a traffic accident.

Rather than immediately receiving personal training or exercising,

You can reduce the time spent lying down in your daily life and consciously increase your level of activity.

Just doing that will have a significant effect.

And please visit the hospital to get tested.

Please consult with your doctor and receive physical therapy.

First of all, it is important to ensure that there are no issues even if you engage in activities that way.

If it is said that you can exercise after that, you should proceed in the direction of exercising.

You said that I shouldn't eat less.

To lose body fat, shouldn't we use that body fat as energy?

If you don't eat less, you won't be lacking in energy.

If there is no energy shortage, the body won't use body fat for energy.

So how does dieting work?

It's one of the most frequently asked questions.

To reduce body fat

It is not necessary to put your body in a state of energy deficiency.

How body fat can be lost without putting the body in a state of energy deficiency is about.

I explained it in detail in another video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

I understand that I shouldn't eat less and that delivery food isn't good.

So what should I eat? I can't just eat anything, right?

You can eat unrefined foods compared to the foods you were previously eating.

In a video explaining the principles of dieting, I talked in detail about unrefined foods.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right.

What foods contribute to obesity and through what mechanisms do they do so?

If you are curious about what foods you can eat to feel full while still losing weight,

You can click to see it.

I understand that I should eat unprocessed foods, but I just don't want to.

I keep wanting to eat snacks or cake.

It feels like I can't digest unrefined food even if I eat it.

If you live for a long time with a small amount of food, your basal metabolic rate will decrease.

As the basal metabolic rate decreases and the digestive system weakens, that can happen.

In this case, you should prioritize recovering the digestive system.

In the past, a flight attendant requested help with a similar story.

So we talked about ways to recover a weakened digestive system.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click here to see it.

Earlier in the video, you mentioned that there are two types of body fat.

It is said that men tend to gain weight primarily in the form of visceral fat, while women tend to gain weight mainly as subcutaneous fat.

Why does such a difference occur, and why is exercise effective for reducing subcutaneous fat?

I previously created a series of videos about subcutaneous fat and explained it in detail.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
