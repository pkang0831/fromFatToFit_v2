Hello, this is pkang.

A question came up in the comments asking what I think about doing cardio on an empty stomach.

This is the second video made about aerobic and anaerobic exercise.

The content continues from the first video.

If you haven't watched the previous video, you may not understand the content or may misunderstand it.

The video link is available in the top right corner.

I recommend that those who haven't watched the previous video go and watch it.

If you have seen the first video,

Anaerobic exercise is high-intensity exercise, while aerobic exercise is low-intensity exercise.

You probably know that high-intensity exercise is better for burning body fat than low-intensity exercise.

If this information is misunderstood, it may seem that activities like running, walking, cycling, and jumping rope are less important.

Weightlifting, which involves lifting heavy objects, can be thought to be more effective for losing body fat.

Exercises like running, walking, cycling, and jumping rope are considered aerobic, low-intensity exercises.

Weight training and strength training are often thought of as anaerobic, high-intensity exercises.

The distinction between low-intensity exercise and high-intensity exercise is based on intensity rather than the type of exercise.

The intensity varies depending on the person.

So, depending on the person who exercises and the intensity of the exercise,

Running, walking, cycling, and jumping rope can sometimes lead to better fat burning.

Weight training and strength training can sometimes lead to better fat burning.

For example, in the case of a severely obese person with no prior exercise experience,

Even just power walking makes me out of breath and my heart races, and it's hard to do it for a long time.

However, in the case of someone who has exercised to some extent,

With power walking at the same pace, I don't get out of breath, my heart doesn't race, and it isn't difficult.

The exercise known as power walking can be considered a high-intensity workout for individuals with severe obesity.

For someone who has done some exercise, it becomes low-intensity exercise.

If you perform weight training with a weight that is suitable for you, it can be done at a low intensity while maintaining your breathing.

When you exercise with a heavy weight, your breathing becomes irregular, resulting in high-intensity exercise.

So, I heard that walking doesn't help you lose weight; you have to run.

A person who finds it very difficult just to walk quickly tried to force themselves to run.

There are times when it's so difficult that I can't even run properly and end up giving up on exercising.

If walking is challenging enough for me, it can be considered a high-intensity workout.

So, you don't have to be obsessed with the idea that you have to perform a certain exercise in a specific way.

How can I tell if the exercise I am doing is high intensity?

The easiest way is to check your heart rate.

When exercising, if the heart rate exceeds 80% of the maximum heart rate, it is considered high-intensity exercise.

Exercise at 70% or below of your maximum heart rate is considered low-intensity exercise.

A person's maximum heart rate gradually decreases as they age.

There is some error, but the simplest way to calculate is (220 - age).

For example, for a 25-year-old, the maximum heart rate is 220 - 25, which equals 195.

80% of 195 is 156, and 70% of 195 is 136.

So when a 25-year-old person exercises,

If the heart rate is above 156, it is considered high-intensity exercise, and if the heart rate is below 136, it is considered low-intensity exercise.

If it's between 156 and 136, then you are doing moderate-intensity exercise as shown in the first video.

I heard that you shouldn't take breaks while exercising. Is it okay to take a break if your heart rate is high?

As long as your heart rate is maintained, you can rest.

High-intensity exercise with a high heart rate makes it quite difficult to continue exercising.

So, after raising the heart rate sufficiently with high-intensity exercise,

Rest briefly or engage in low-intensity exercise while keeping your heart rate within a manageable range.

There is a way to do high-intensity exercise again.

By doing this, you can relatively easily maintain your heart rate compared to doing high-intensity exercise continuously.

A high heart rate is maintained for a long time, making it very effective for burning body fat.

This way of exercising is called interval training.

How do you measure heart rate?

If you have a smartphone, you can measure your heart rate using an app.

If you don't have a smartphone, place your hand on the pulse point on your wrist.

After checking how many times the heart beats in 6 seconds, multiply that number by 10 to calculate the heart rate.

For example, if your heart beats 15 times in 6 seconds, it means your current heart rate is around 150.

So, how do you actually exercise?

First, please choose the type of exercise based on your situation and preferences.

You can follow the workouts of famous trainers, celebrities, and YouTubers exactly as they do.

You can choose an exercise that is easily accessible because it's near your home or an exercise you want to do.

If you have chosen the type of exercise, please adjust the intensity to suit your body.

For example, if there is an exercise with 15 repetitions and a 1-minute rest, how many sets should be done?

If you exercised 15 times but your heart rate is not high, it means the intensity of your workout is low.

If the exercise intensity is low, don't just follow along blindly; please increase the intensity to make it high for yourself.

There are various ways to increase exercise intensity, and you can adjust it according to your goals.

If you want to increase muscle size, you should increase the weight or change your posture to increase the load.

If you want to improve your agility, you should increase the speed of your workouts.

If you want to increase your endurance, you should do more than 15 repetitions.

In this way, I increased my heart rate during exercise.

If your heart rate drops too much during the rest period between sets,

Since the break time is long, we need to reduce the break time itself.

If reducing the rest time means that I can't recover and can't do the next set, then...

You can maintain your break time, but you can do low-intensity exercise during that time.

On the contrary, if the intensity of the exercise is too high and I find it difficult to keep up,

Just don't give up; you can lower the load, slow down the pace, or reduce the number of repetitions.

To summarize, the high-intensity exercise that I can continue without giving up is

This is about the most effective diet exercise for me.

So don't just follow blindly, and don't give up just because it's difficult.

You can adjust it to suit your body and exercise accordingly.

Sounds plausible, right?

In the next video, I will talk about fasted cardio.
