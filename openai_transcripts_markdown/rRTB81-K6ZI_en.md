The most important thing in a diet plan - Losing belly fat Part 3

In Part 1 of the video, we explored what belly fat is and how to lose it in general.

In the second part of the video, we talked about improving eating habits.

In this video, I would like to talk about how to plan a diet.

To lose weight, one must improve their eating habits. This is something everyone knows.

However, many people often misunderstand the phrase "improving eating habits."

If this happens, even if you succeed in your diet, the yo-yo effect will come back.

To improve our eating habits, we need to understand which foods make us gain weight and

To understand which foods help us lose weight, we need to grasp the basic concepts.

I talked about this in detail in the video on how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight.

It's really good to learn how to distinguish between foods...

Can you just decide and tell me to eat this?

No, it won't work.

Many people follow the diet of celebrities or YouTubers who have successfully lost weight.

And quite a few people succeed in dieting using that method.

However, in this case, most people tend to stop their diet once they succeed in losing weight.

Because the diet is over.

Since the diet is over, isn't it natural to stop following the diet plan?

If the purpose of the diet is to lose weight, then yes.

I followed a diet to lose weight, but...

Since I've lost weight, there's no need to continue the diet.

The problem is that if I don't stick to a diet, I end up eating the same foods I used to eat.

In the first place, I gained weight from eating the food I originally ate, so I will end up gaining weight again.

When you gain weight, you end up falling into a vicious cycle of having to diet again.

Even if I gain weight again, I can lose it by following a diet.

It is a repeating cycle, but isn't it not a vicious cycle?

It is indeed a vicious cycle.

The human body is inherently characterized by its ability to adapt to repeated stimuli, resulting in a gradual weakening of its response.

In simple terms, it's about developing resistance.

This resistance also applies to dieting.

Even if someone has actually succeeded in dieting,

Once the yo-yo effect occurs, it can be difficult to lose weight using the same methods.

So it is correct to see it as a vicious cycle.

So, does that mean I should continue eating the diet plan even after the diet is over? For a lifetime?

How can you eat that for a lifetime??

You just need to avoid creating a diet with foods that you can't eat for a lifetime.

A diet solely aimed at losing weight is

There are often limitations in order to maximize the effects.

Barely adding seasonings like salt or sugar

It's common to severely restrict fats or eat very few carbohydrates.

In this case, it would obviously be hard to eat, and it doesn't make sense to eat this kind of food for a lifetime.

The advice to improve your eating habits does not mean to eat such foods for a lifetime.

It means to change the quality of the food you eat.

At the end of the video on how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods.

There is talk about low-carb high-fat diets and high-carb low-fat diets.

A low-carb, high-fat diet is based on the idea that carbohydrates are the cause of obesity.

It is a diet that suggests reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat intake.

A high-carb, low-fat diet is because fat is the cause of obesity.

This is a diet that suggests reducing fat intake and increasing carbohydrate intake.

Usually, when there are opposing arguments like this, if one side is right, the other side must be wrong.

In reality, both diets can lead to weight loss.

This is because the basic principle of dieting is the same.

The diet and weight loss methods you know, as well as the ones you will learn about in the future.

Everything is created by adding different conditions on top of this basic principle.

When the condition of restricting carbohydrates is added to the basic principle, it becomes a low-carb, high-fat diet.

When a condition to limit fat is added to the basic principle, it becomes a high-carb, low-fat diet.

Simply put, no matter what diet you choose, as long as you stick to the basic principles, you can lose weight.

Within the scope of adhering to that basic principle, I can freely choose the ingredients I want.

For example, if you like meat, you can eat unprocessed meat.

I’m told to eat a lot of vegetables, but I don’t like them because they have a bitter taste.

In that case, you can eat vegetables that have a sweet taste, like onions or cabbage.

I don't like meat. In that case, you can have eggs or tofu.

I don't like greasy food. In that case, you can go for a high-carb, low-fat diet.

So, someone followed a certain diet and lost a few kilograms.

Don't just blindly follow what you hear.

It is about finding a diet that suits me.

That diet is suitable for that person from the beginning; it’s not the right diet for me.

Actually, one of my acquaintances is

I got angry while watching YouTube trying to follow the diet of a slim YouTuber.

The reason was because of the avocado.

I tried eating avocado because many people eat it, but I didn't find it very tasty.

The price is relatively high, and it was difficult to find because it wasn't available at the nearby store.

The diet that included avocado did not suit that acquaintance.

I need to create a diet with foods I like that are easy to obtain and not financially burdensome.

While dieting, the meal plan is not difficult.

Even after the diet is over, there is no problem continuing with the meal plan.

Creating a meal plan myself with foods that suit me like this is

The first step in changing eating habits is

The meal plan created here is realistic and sustainable.

It's not that I have to endure a diet that doesn't suit me and continue eating it to change my eating habits.

You need to do this to change your eating habits.

However, even if you choose your favorite ingredients like that, it won't taste good if you can't season them properly.

Yes, that's right. So you can season it.

As mentioned earlier,

A diet that solely aims to lose weight must maximize its effectiveness.

It is common to limit salt or sugar.

In this case, the diet lacks flavor.

As mentioned in the video about why diet meals are tasteless,

The problem is not adding salt or sugar itself, but rather adding too much of it.

You can adjust the portions to enjoy delicious food while still being able to diet.

Videos related to the taste of the diet are linked at the top right.

In the next video, we will talk about the ET body shape, also known as the tadpole belly.

I will talk about body types that have limbs but carry a lot of belly fat.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the fourth part of the belly fat loss series,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
