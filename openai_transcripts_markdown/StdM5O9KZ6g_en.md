Hello, this is pkang.

"I gain weight even when I starve; I gain weight just by drinking water." I will talk about this statement.

The reaction of people to that statement is mostly that it is impossible.

It's because they think that not eating food or drinking calorie-free water won't lead to weight gain.

So I think that even though they ate the food, they forget about it and say such things out of misunderstanding.

Is it possible to forget that you ate food?

Forgetting the fact that you actually ate food or

There are quite a few cases where people are not aware of how much food they are eating.

So when I was asked to keep a food diary recording everything I ate,

Many people are surprised to realize that they have eaten more food than they thought, and from that moment on, they start dieting.

So there is a saying that you can lose weight just by diligently keeping a food diary.

However, if that statement comes from a misunderstanding of the amount of food being consumed,

"Even if I starve, I gain weight. 'I gain weight just by drinking water.'"

The person saying this should be present in similar proportions of men and women.

Men can also misjudge the amount of food they eat.

However, most of the people who say such things are women.

Are you saying that women misjudge the amount of food they eat?

Of course, that's not the case.

There are quite a few men who misjudge the amount of food they eat.

When we look at men who actually eat a lot but are troubled by being too thin,

In many cases, people mistakenly believe they are eating a lot, even though the actual amount of food they consume is quite small.

Misjudging the amount of food one eats is not something that only happens to women.

Then why do only women say things like "I gain weight even when I starve" or "I gain weight just by drinking water"?

It is because I actually experience such phenomena.

Although it is expressed as gaining weight, what is actually experienced is an increase in body weight.

A woman of childbearing age ovulates an egg once a month.

When an egg is ovulated, blood vessels in the endometrium expand and secretory glands develop for pregnancy.

When pregnant, the body retains nutrients and water for the purpose of supply.

When something that wasn't in the body is created and nutrients and moisture are bound together, this causes an increase in weight.

So, in the case of women, when ovulation begins,

Even if you don't eat and just drink water, you will experience an increase in weight.

So, there are stories like "I gain weight even when I starve" and "I gain weight just by drinking water."

In the case of men, they do not experience menstruation, so they cannot have such experiences.

That's why they don't talk about such things.

The unfortunate thing is that many women do not properly understand these changes in their bodies.

During that time, I worked hard on my diet, but instead, I gained weight and ended up giving up on the diet.

Due to the stress from gaining weight, I sometimes binge eat and fail at dieting.

It is normal to gain weight during the ovulation period.

When menstruation begins, the endometrial tissue breaks down and is expelled along with menstrual blood.

As the nutrients and moisture that were trapped in the body are released, it returns to its original weight.

I hope you don't give up on your diet or feel too stressed just because your weight has increased during ovulation.

In the following video, I will summarize the changes in appetite and weight according to the menstrual cycle.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the menstrual diet video, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making it.

If you found this video helpful, please subscribe and like it. I will return with the next video.

Thank you.
