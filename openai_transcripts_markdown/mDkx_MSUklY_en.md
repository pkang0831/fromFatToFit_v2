I want to diet, but I keep giving up quickly.

A comment with this kind of content has been posted, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the content of the comments.

I have been obese since I was young and have never been thin even once.

I don't want to spend my twenties like this, so I've been on a diet a lot.

Most of them gave up after a short time.

I don't think there is anything wrong with the dieting methods.

It's not that I just ate less or starved myself.

I have studied a lot about dieting on YouTube.

I have watched a lot of videos from pkang, so I am well aware of the importance of unrefined foods.

I didn't starve or eat less; I diligently followed my diet while carrying a packed lunch with me.

Eating unprocessed foods really reduces my appetite.

I was a bit surprised that I could lose weight even after eating until I was full.

I'm not just following a diet; I'm also working out hard for an hour each day at the gym.

I have also stopped eating late-night snacks after work.

I liked watching dramas, so I enjoyed staying up late to watch them before going to sleep.

It is said that getting more than 8 hours of deep sleep is important for dieting.

I am trying to stop watching dramas and go to bed as early as possible to get more than 8 hours of sleep.

I believe it is a proper diet, and in fact, the dieting effects are quite good.

However, I really work hard for the first one to two months, but after that, I always end up giving up.

I am eating unprocessed foods to my heart's content, so I am not hungry and have no issues with my appetite.

So the diet isn't difficult or anything.

I just... feel drained and don't want to do anything, and when I come to my senses, I'm back to my usual routine.

Why is this happening? Is it just that I lack willpower?

I'm planning to start dieting again, but I'm worried that I might give up again.

I really dislike this side of myself too.

Is there any story that could help someone like me, who is weak-willed?

This is a comment that says.

First of all, cutting out lunch boxes, exercise, late-night snacks, and getting quality sleep are indeed effective methods for dieting.

Of course, there is no separate information on how the diet is structured, but...

If you have a proper understanding of unrefined foods, the likelihood of having issues with your diet is high.

You said that you are not actually hungry and that there are no issues with your appetite.

However, while each method is effective for dieting,

Doing it all at once can be problematic.

Why is it a problem to try doing all the methods that are effective for dieting at once?

You can experience burnout.

Burnout occurs when one becomes excessively enthusiastic and immersed in work.

I am talking about the symptoms of extreme physical and mental fatigue that lead to a feeling of lethargy.

Even if you change your work to a diet here, the same symptoms may occur.

So, being overly enthusiastic about dieting...

When physical and mental fatigue reaches its peak, one becomes lethargic.

You lose the motivation to diet itself and end up giving up on dieting.

Let's talk about one thing at a time.

First, exercise.

It’s said to be just one hour of exercise a day, but it includes the time spent going to and from the gym.

If you consider the time for stretching and washing before and after exercise,

The actual time spent is about 2 hours.

Seeing the term "going home from work" indicates that the person is an office worker.

Most office workers have a routine of starting work at 9 AM and finishing at 6 PM.

The time after work until going to bed is my leisure time.

If you go to bed at 10 o'clock, you will have 4 hours of free time after work.

If you go to bed at 12, you will have about 6 hours of free time after work.

So before starting a diet,

The time I used to relieve stress from work and relax was about 4 to 6 hours.

If you spend 2 hours on exercise, your leisure time will decrease by that amount.

Exercise is good for health and dieting, but...

It is fundamentally an act that puts stress on the body.

Applying strong stress to the body.

You become stronger in the process of overcoming that stress.

So if you spend 2 hours on exercise,

The leisure time for relieving stress decreases by about 2 hours.

Rather, due to the stress caused by exercise.

The total amount of stress I am experiencing is increasing.

Second late-night snack.

Many people relieve the stress they receive at work by eating late-night snacks.

Using late-night snacks to relieve stress is indeed a bad habit.

To lose weight, it's essential to cut out late-night snacks, but...

It is possible to reduce stress with late-night snacks.

The stress received at work remains as it is.

If you stop having late-night snacks that relieve your stress,

The stress I receive at work is not being relieved and is gradually accumulating.

The same goes for watching dramas late at night.

Watching dramas itself is a leisure activity that reduces my stress.

If I cut this out for my diet, I will lose my leisure activities.

As a result, you are unable to relieve stress.

The same goes for the diet.

Food does not come into existence on its own.

Someone has to make that food.

Before starting a diet,

When you enter a restaurant and place an order or order for delivery,

Someone else cooks, and I just have to wait and eat.

When I start a diet, I have to make the food myself.

I need to buy the ingredients to use for the meal plan.

You need to prepare and cook the purchased ingredients before you can eat them.

After eating, you also have to do the dishes.

For someone who is not familiar with cooking, preparing and organizing meals can be quite a concern.

The time spent on preparing and organizing meals reduces leisure time.

The stress I experience like this keeps increasing, but

When the leisure time that relieves that stress decreases,

Eventually, stress starts to accumulate.

Due to the stress that accumulates like this

When physical and mental fatigue reaches its limit,

Burnout leads to feelings of lethargy.

And it is because of this lethargy that I end up giving up on dieting.

It's not that I'm giving up because it's hard and difficult.

The will to diet itself disappears, and so you just stop.

However, there are people who successfully lose weight by changing their eating habits and lifestyle all at once.

Yes, that's right.

Diet burnout occurs when stress accumulates to its limit.

The amount of stress you usually experience is low or

In the case of a person with a high tolerance for stress,

There are cases where people succeed in dieting all at once without experiencing diet burnout.

The problem is that the person in question is not that kind of person.

So, does that mean that people with a low tolerance for stress cannot go on a diet?

No, that's not the case.

You can change the way you diet.

It's not just about doing as many good actions for dieting as possible.

Considering the limits of my stress, I am doing it step by step.

Actions for dieting initially cause stress, but...

When the body adapts, it actually reduces stress.

For example,

In the case of the person sharing their story, they were relieving stress from work with late-night snacks and dramas.

If you can cut off late-night snacks and dramas all at once here,

The means to relieve stress will disappear.

This leads to a buildup of stress.

In this case, even if you go to bed a bit late while watching a drama,

It is better to prioritize cutting out late-night snacks.

I mentioned it in another video as well.

The problem with late-night snacks is that you go to sleep without properly digesting the food.

The problem is that digestion occurs while sleeping.

This will interfere with a good night's sleep.

Then, when you wake up in the morning, you feel quite fatigued.

Because of this fatigue, it was difficult all day long that day.

This is causing me to feel stressed again.

On the other hand, even if you go to bed somewhat late, if you go to sleep without having a late-night snack,

Digestion does not occur while you are sleeping.

The fatigue you feel in the morning will decrease.

Once you get used to this kind of life,

As the total amount of stress I experience decreases, I find myself feeling more relaxed.

When you have some spare time, you can add other methods then.

The same goes for diet and exercise.

If you exercise at too high an intensity, it can create stress on your body, but

Exercising at a light intensity can actually help reduce stress.

To lose weight, you need to exercise hard and intensely for at least one hour a day.

To break free from such thoughts.

You can think of it as just lightly moving your body to relieve stress.

Just by doing that, you can achieve the effects of dieting.

You can relieve stress through exercise.

In fact, just walking for about 10 minutes after a meal can help with weight loss.

Once you become accustomed to exercising and feel more comfortable, you can then increase the intensity and duration of your workouts.

The same goes for the diet.

It is good to carry a packed lunch and stick to a strict diet, but...

Doing that means I have to eat alone at work, and it makes things difficult for me.

I'm feeling pressured because my coworkers are interested in my diet.

If you say that preparing a lunchbox is too cumbersome...

First, let's have lunch as usual.

If you just change the food I eat at home to unrefined foods, that would be enough.

First, do it that way, and if you have some spare time later, you can add other methods then.

So to summarize,

Dieting isn't difficult, but if you keep giving up lethargically, then...

It is that my body cannot withstand the stress caused by dieting.

This is a problem with the way I am dieting, not that I am doing something wrong.

In the first place, everyone is different. Our bodies are different, and the environments we are in are also different.

In a stressful environment, a person who lacks leisure time is...

You may not be able to endure the stress caused by dieting.

That can happen.

So, just because you give up on dieting...

I am a person with weak willpower. I lack perseverance. I have weak willpower. I am foolish.

Please don't belittle yourself like this.

You can take your time with your diet to suit your body and your environment.

In trying to do it quickly no matter what,

Rather than continuously failing, stopping, and returning to the same place,

Even if you go slowly, continuing steadily will ultimately be faster.

If it's difficult to change a lot at once, you can start by changing something manageable.

You can do that.
