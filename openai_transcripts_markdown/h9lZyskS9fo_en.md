Hello, this is pkang.

Is there a way to effectively lose only body fat while maintaining muscle?

In this video, I will talk about muscle loss.

In the case of severe obesity with a high body weight, if you conduct a test using InBody,

It shows that there is a lot of body fat, but it also indicates that there is a lot of muscle mass.

Looking at this, "I have a naturally muscular physique."

I have a body type that easily builds muscle. I think this way sometimes.

So, in the case of men, some think that just getting rid of body fat will make them fit.

If a woman has this much muscle even without exercising,

I'm worried that if I exercise, I'll gain a lot of muscle and end up with a bulky body.

Women do not easily build muscle. I've heard this a lot, but...

I don't even exercise, yet I have so much muscle on my body right now.

I think it's a unique constitution that is different from an average woman.

However, that's not actually the case.

A person whose normal weight is 60 kg but currently weighs 80 kg is considered obese.

Compared to a normal weight, I weigh 20kg more, and since 2 liters of bottled water weighs about 2kg,

It means that they always carry 10 bottles of 2-liter water.

If you always carry heavy things like this, it's natural that your muscles will develop accordingly.

So, it's not that I was born with a lot of muscle or that I have a body type that easily gains muscle.

It means that muscles have developed in order to support and move a heavy body.

However, the muscle gained through weight gain is different from the muscle built through exercise.

To make the explanation easier, muscles developed from body weight are called weight muscles.

Muscles developed through exercise will be referred to as exercise muscles.

It is not an official name, but a term I have arbitrarily chosen for the sake of convenience in explanation.

Muscles develop the more you use them, and they deteriorate the less you use them.

If a person who has built a lot of muscle through exercise takes a long break from working out,

Even if you consume enough nutrients, muscle loss occurs because you do not exercise.

A person weighing 80 kg develops enough muscle to move 80 kg.

If I lose weight to reach 70kg through dieting,

Since you have lost 10kg, you will no longer use that much muscle weight.

Unused muscle mass will be lost over time.

So, experiencing muscle loss while dieting is a natural symptom.

Many people say that when dieting, you should exercise to reduce muscle loss.

Is what these people are saying incorrect?

That's not the case.

Again, muscles develop the more you use them, and they deteriorate the less you use them.

A person who weighs a lot without exercising.

Because I weigh a lot, my muscle mass has developed, but...

Since I don't exercise, my muscles have not developed.

If you diet in this state,

As weight decreases, muscle mass will also decrease.

In that case, the overall muscle mass becomes insufficient.

Because this is not good, increase your muscle through exercise.

It means that we need to ensure that the overall muscle mass is not lacking.

I will summarize.

The muscle gained from being overweight is

When weight decreases, usage decreases, leading to losses.

This is a natural phenomenon, so there is no way to stop it, nor is there a need to.

The problem is the loss of muscle mass.

Without following an extreme low-calorie diet or fasting for a long time,

If you are someone who exercises, your muscle will not be lost.

So if you are dieting correctly,

Even if muscle loss occurs, there is no need to worry too much.

Since it's weight that needs to be lost anyway, it's the muscle that is losing weight.

Sounds plausible, right?
