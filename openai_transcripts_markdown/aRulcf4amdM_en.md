A question with the following content was posted in the comments, and this is the second video answering that question.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

I am curious about the side effects and adverse reactions when following a low-carbohydrate diet, and what foods you would recommend if one is consuming fats.

In the first video, we looked at the side effects that occur when carbohydrates are completely eliminated or consumed in extremely low amounts.

If you haven't seen the first video, there's a link in the top right corner, so you can click on it to watch.

In this video, I will talk about the second question, which is recommendations for local food.

To get straight to the point, it seems difficult to recommend a specific food.

Because each person has foods that are suitable for them and foods that are not.

There are issues of preference and accessibility.

Let me explain each one step by step...

First, a representative example of foods that are suitable and unsuitable is the fruit avocado.

It has become known to be good for dieting, and more people are eating it.

If a person who is suited to eat avocados consumes them, there are no issues.

If the wrong person eats it, they may experience symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea.

I received treatment at the hospital because of this.

"I know that avocado is a healthy fruit, so I couldn't think that it could be the cause."

There are also cases where individuals revisit the hospital after consuming avocados and experiencing symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea.

If you experience any adverse reactions in your body after eating, it is best not to consume that food.

The strongest preference is shown for GMOs.

One way we easily consume fat is through cooking oil.

There are various types of cooking oil.

Some products contain oil extracted from genetically modified (GMO) crops.

Some people show resistance because GMOs involve genetic modification.

Some people believe that GMOs are harmful to the body because their safety has not been verified.

On the contrary, there are people who have no aversion to GMOs themselves.

It has been quite some time since GMOs were introduced, but their harmfulness has not yet been proven.

There is also a viewpoint that it is difficult to see GMOs as having negative effects on health.

This is not a situation where a conclusion has been reached about whether it is harmful or not.

It is a case where each person has different preferences.

The third aspect of accessibility is a characteristic that often arises due to price.

The fat of animals that are raised by feeding them grass and allowing them to graze.

It is natural that animals raised on a diet of feed and kept in confinement have less healthy fat.

However, animals raised this way are very expensive.

For some people, it is an amount they can spend for their health, but...

For some people, it can be food that is too expensive to eat.

Please take the condition of maintaining balance as a basic premise.

Within the range that meets this condition, I have no adverse effects on my body when I eat.

It is easily accessible and not financially burdensome.

You can give what you prefer.

Balancing can be achieved by simply applying well-known principles of fat management.

The balance between saturated and unsaturated fats.

The balance between omega-3 and omega-6 should be maintained.

You may have heard that meat has a high proportion of saturated fat.

You may have heard that plant oils contain a lot of unsaturated fats.

Then, when we eat meat, it gets boring if we only eat one type.

Don't eat like that; start with the fatty parts, then try the lean parts as well.

It's good to eat a variety of foods, such as eggs on some days and chicken on others.

There are times when you need to add oil when eating a variety of foods.

When trying to eat parts without oil, such as frying an egg or eating chicken breast.

In this case, you need to add oil.

At this time, you add vegetable oil.

And in the case of omega-3 and omega-6 as well.

You may have heard that the meat we eat has a high ratio of omega-6 because it is raised on feed.

In that case, when choosing vegetable oil, you should select one with a high ratio of omega-3.

You don't need to think too complicated or difficult.

Sounds plausible, right?

Then I will come back with a different video next time.

See you next time, goodbye~~
