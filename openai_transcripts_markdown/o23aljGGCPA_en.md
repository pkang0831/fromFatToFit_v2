I'm on a diet, but I want something crunchy, so I feel like eating snacks.

I'm on a diet, but I've been seeing comments about wanting to eat snacks all the time.

I am discussing why I crave snacks while on a diet.

There are various reasons why I want to eat snacks.

Among them, I like the crispy texture of the snacks.

So there are times when you think you want to eat snacks.

There was someone who shared their experience very well in the comments of the last video.

I would like to continue the story based on that comment.

To summarize the comments briefly,

When dieting, I often have a strong craving for a crunchy texture.

The first thing that comes to mind is snacks, but they are not good for dieting.

It is said that they will look for alternatives like cheese or fried pork rinds heated in the microwave.

In the case of such substitutes, at first, they are somewhat acceptable to eat, but...

Soon, satisfaction will decrease, and people will look for alternative products like nuts such as almonds.

These nuts have a high level of satisfaction, but...

The nutritional density is too high, like calories.

They say they feel frustrated by the fact that they can't eat much.

When I feel frustrated, I think of today as a cheating day and eat snacks with a sense of giving up.

The next day, they say they start dieting again while regretting it.

And when the desire for a crispy texture arises again, you go back to the beginning.

It's a really typical pattern, and I was surprised that you wrote it so well.

It seems that many people resonate with this, considering the high number of recommendations.

However, if you take a closer look at this information, there is one strange point.

If the reason I want to eat snacks right now is due to a craving for a crunchy texture,

You should be satisfied when eating alternatives like cheese heated in the microwave or fried pork rinds.

You can achieve a crispy texture with such substitutes.

However, even though I ate substitutes, my craving for snacks didn't go away.

So, I want to eat a crunchy snack, but...

The reason for such desires is not the crispy texture.

You don't want a crispy texture? Then why do you want to eat crispy snacks?

In the last video, I mentioned that snacks and cakes are sweet and have a high carbohydrate content, but...

At the same time, it was said to be high in calories.

However, this is also true for crispy snacks.

Snacks are mostly made by processing carbohydrates as the main ingredient.

Basically, it has a high carbohydrate content.

And for a crispy texture, it is often cooked by baking or frying.

When moisture is removed by roasting, the calories per gram increase according to the amount of moisture that has been reduced.

When fried in oil, additional fat is added, which similarly increases the calorie content.

So, the body of a person who usually enjoys eating crispy snacks is

I know that snacks with a crispy texture are foods that can provide a lot of carbohydrates and calories.

Therefore, if you are in a situation where carbohydrates or calories are lacking due to dieting,

It reminds me of a crispy snack that you can get a lot of.

So I thought that wanting a crispy texture was the problem, but...

The truth is that it's the nutrient issue mentioned in the previous video.
