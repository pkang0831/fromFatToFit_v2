Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video about stagnation, created in response to questions about it in the comments.

The traffic jam video is in the top right corner, and the playlist link is being shared.

If you're curious about the previous video, you can click to watch it.

Since there is a continuation from the previous video, it is recommended to watch the earlier video if possible.

In Part 1 of the video, we will discuss how to distinguish between fake identity crises and real identity crises.

We talked about the balance that causes stagnation.

The balance that creates a plateau is established through homeostasis.

Among homeostasis, the absorption rate of food has the most direct impact.

In calorie diet theory,

Let's assume that 100% of the calories from the food I ate were absorbed.

In reality, the nutrients from the food we eat are not absorbed 100%.

A certain amount is absorbed, and the rest is expelled from the body.

After eating, once digestion and absorption are complete, it is expelled from the body as feces.

The reason why plants grow well when this feces is used as fertilizer is

Nutrients remain in the feces, and these nutrients help in the growth of plants.

If nutrients are absorbed 100%, there would be no nutrients in the feces.

In that case, it wouldn't even be usable as fertilizer. But that's not actually the case.

What percentage of the nutrients from the food I ate has been absorbed? This is referred to as the absorption rate.

This absorption rate is not fixed.

There are characteristics that change according to the homeostasis that seeks to maintain the current state.

For example, if you eat a lot, your body tries to maintain weight by lowering the absorption rate.

Eating less is an attempt to increase absorption rates in order to maintain weight.

If you want to maintain your weight when your absorption rate decreases after eating a lot of food,

Isn't it supposed to be that you don't gain weight even if you eat a lot? Why does obesity exist?

In the case of unrefined foods, the absorption rate decreases when consumed in large quantities.

In the case of refined foods, the absorption rate does not decrease.

Refined foods contain a lot of refined carbohydrates such as sugar, white rice, and flour.

Carbohydrates are converted into glucose in the body and spread throughout the body via the bloodstream.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is called blood sugar.

In the case of refined carbohydrates, they have a high carbohydrate content and are quickly digested and absorbed.

When you consume refined carbohydrates, too many carbohydrates enter the body.

There is a problem with blood sugar levels becoming too high.

If blood sugar levels remain too high for an extended period, it can cause inflammation in the blood vessel walls.

The hormone called insulin is secreted, which functions to lower blood sugar levels.

This insulin converts glucose into fat, storing it as body fat, which also lowers blood sugar levels.

The fat you consume is also stored as body fat.

When you eat foods that cause a lot of insulin to be released,

A significant amount of the calories from food is stored as body fat, leading to obesity.

In this situation, there will be a lack of energy available for immediate use, leading to a need for food again.

If there is too much food and it is not needed, the absorption rate will decrease.

If you need food, the absorption rate does not decrease.

In the case of processed foods, even if you eat a lot, a strange phenomenon occurs where the absorption rate does not decrease.

This means that homeostasis cannot prevent obesity.

Returning to the original story.

When you follow a low-calorie diet, you initially lose weight due to the calorie deficit.

Because of the lack of calories, the absorption rate increases and the metabolic rate decreases.

When the absorption rate increases, you get more calories from the same food.

When the metabolic rate decreases, the calorie consumption will also decrease.

When the calories obtained from food and the calories consumed are balanced,

A plateau is formed where body fat does not decrease.

If you give up on your diet in this situation and start eating the foods you used to eat,

Due to the high absorption rate and low metabolism, there is a phenomenon where one gains more weight than their original weight.

This is called a yo-yo.

I don't follow a low-calorie diet, but I make sure to eat at least my basal metabolic rate.

However, I also have periods of stagnation. Why do I experience stagnation?

It is not good to eat little or to starve, so you should at least eat enough to meet your basal metabolic rate.

There are many cases where we talk like this.

Many people think that if they eat only their basal metabolic rate, it is not a low-calorie diet.

In reality, it is not like that.

The energy a person consumes in a day consists of three components: basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate.

Basal metabolic rate refers to the minimum amount of energy required for a person to live.

If there is not enough energy supplied to the heart, it will stop, and that would lead to death.

If there is not enough energy supplied to the brain, it can stop functioning and lead to a state of brain death.

If other organs like the lungs, small intestine, and large intestine stop functioning, life is at risk.

And because humans are warm-blooded animals that need to maintain their body temperature,

You need to always maintain a body temperature of 36.5 degrees.

Even coffee made with boiling water at 100 degrees will cool down after an hour.

To maintain a constant temperature of 36.5 degrees for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, a lot of energy is required.

The energy consumed to maintain life is called the basal metabolic rate.

Eating just enough food to meet your basal metabolic rate means

It means that in order to meet the basal metabolic rate and ensure survival, that food must be absorbed 100%.

So eating only as much as your basal metabolic rate means that

From the body's perspective, it means that the absorption rate should be maximized.

Moreover, the energy a person consumes in a day is not just based on their basal metabolic rate.

The amount of energy expenditure used for activities such as waking up, moving, thinking, working, and studying.

If you are exercising, there is also the metabolic rate used during exercise.

Even if the absorption rate reaches 100%, the energy from the basal metabolic rate and exercise metabolism will still be insufficient.

The body's metabolic rate decreases.

The absorption rate increases while the metabolic rate decreases.

The same problems that occur with a low-calorie diet will arise.

However, shouldn't the calories consumed be greater than the calories ingested in order to use body fat?

How can you diet if you eat all your calories?

What matters is not the calories, but whether you can endure hunger or not.

There is a video I made in the past about the principles of dieting without feeling hungry.

This is the content that was covered in detail in the video.

If you are curious about why body fat decreases even when calories are not lacking,

The video link is displayed in the upper right, so you can click on it to watch.

Returning to the topic of stagnation...

The cause of the plateau that arises from a low-calorie diet is the low calorie itself.

So increasing your calorie intake will solve the problem.

The reason why having a cheat day can help you break through a plateau when you're on a low-calorie diet.

It is because I supplemented the insufficient calories with a cheat day.

The information provided so far seems to be about a low-calorie diet.

I am not on a low-calorie diet and I am eating enough calories.

I think I'm eating about 3000 calories a day. Why am I experiencing a plateau?

In the next video, we will explore the reasons why a plateau occurs even when following a low-calorie diet.

There should be videos playing on both sides of the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure to have the next video appear on the right.

If the video on the right is not the third part of the traffic jam video, then it means that the video is still being made.

I would appreciate it if you could wait a few days.

If the video was helpful, please like and subscribe.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
