It's been quite a while since I've avoided sweet foods like snacks or bread while dieting.

Since it was my parents' birthday, I had cake, ice cream, and chocolate bread.

I suddenly felt dizzy.

I ate quite a bit, but it used to be an amount that was sufficient for me.

A comment was posted asking, "I'm curious why I'm suddenly feeling dizzy."

To put it simply, let's start with the conclusion.

It is true that I felt dizzy because I suddenly ate too much sugary food.

When we eat food, our blood sugar levels rise.

When blood sugar levels rise, insulin hormone is released to lower this blood sugar.

The insulin hormone lowers blood sugar by storing glucose in the blood as glycogen or body fat.

If you eat too many sweet foods, your blood sugar can rise too quickly and significantly.

Our body is startled by sudden changes in blood sugar and quickly releases a large amount of insulin.

Due to the urgent and excessive secretion, more insulin is released than necessary.

Because too much insulin was secreted.

Blood sugar can drop too low, leading to hypoglycemia.

This low blood sugar causes dizziness and headaches.

I ate quite a bit, but it used to be an amount that was sufficient for me.

There was nothing wrong before, so why am I feeling dizzy now?

It is due to insulin sensitivity.

When we eat food, our blood sugar levels rise, and insulin is released.

Insulin lowers blood sugar by storing glucose in the blood as glycogen or body fat.

If you follow the commands of insulin well here,

It reacts sensitively to insulin, so it is said to have good insulin sensitivity.

On the contrary, if you resist the commands of insulin,

It is said that insulin resistance has increased because of resistance to insulin.

When insulin resistance increases, more insulin is needed to perform the same tasks.

If this situation repeats, more and more insulin is produced, leading to obesity.

The reason why dieting works is that it improves insulin resistance and increases insulin sensitivity.

So in the past, insulin resistance was high.

So even if I eat a lot of sugary foods and a lot of insulin is released,

Because of the insulin resistance, my blood sugar didn't drop low enough to cause hypoglycemia.

I am currently on a diet, and my insulin resistance has improved.

So, it reacts sensitively to a large amount of insulin.

The blood sugar has dropped too low, causing dizziness.

In the past, I could eat a lot of sweet foods without experiencing dizziness or headaches.

Right now, if I eat a lot of sugary foods, I experience dizziness or headaches.

I think that my health might be worse now or that some problems have arisen.

In the first place, responses in the pain category, such as headaches or dizziness, are

This is a signal indicating that there is a problem right now.

When you injure your arm, pain occurs in the arm.

This is a signal to address the problem with the arm.

The problem is that I injured my arm; the pain itself is not the issue.

After eating too many single-flavored foods, I started to feel dizzy and had a headache.

Then what about dizziness or headaches?

Eating too many sweets is a signal that it's not good for you.

The problem is that I've eaten a lot of sweet foods.

The food I'm eating right now is too sweet, and it's causing problems for my body.

It is to tell you to either stop eating or to eat a little bit if you are going to eat.

Eating too much sweet food clearly makes us obese and harms our bodies.

If you eat a lot of sweets and don't experience any signals, that's actually strange.

I really love snacks, cakes, and chocolate, but can I not eat them anymore?

No, that's not the case.

There will be two major changes in the future.

First, your taste may change a little.

When a person takes an action and receives a positive response,

A tendency to repeat that behavior develops.

On the contrary, when you take a certain action and receive a negative response,

A tendency to avoid that behavior develops.

Many people relieve stress after work by having late-night snacks.

When you eat a late-night snack and experience a positive reaction that relieves stress,

After getting off work, I always crave a late-night snack.

If you keep repeating it, it becomes a habit.

In a situation where there was no dizziness despite consuming a lot of sugary foods due to insulin resistance,

There are no negative reactions due to sweet foods.

There are only positive reactions felt through sweetness.

I often try to eat sweet foods frequently and quickly, which is why I've come to like them.

However, now when I eat a lot of sweet foods, I experience negative reactions like dizziness.

So, you tend to not prefer eating sweet foods frequently, quickly, and in large amounts.

In this way, the tendency to like sweet foods will change.

I really love sweet food and want to eat it.

It's not about having to force yourself to endure not eating it.

You start to prefer not eating overly sweet foods too often.

It naturally becomes something you don't eat often.

If you actually look at the comments on my video,

I ate as instructed, and my taste has changed.

So there are quite a few comments saying that snacks they used to like now taste bad, so they don't eat them anymore.

The second change is in the way we consume sugary foods.

In the past, I liked foods such as snacks, chocolate, and cake.

So, I put a large amount in my mouth at once, chew quickly, and swallow.

Then I immediately ate it.

But now if I eat like that, I get a headache.

Eat a small amount at a time.

After eating that, I take a little time before having the next bite.

Simply put, it means eating slowly and in small amounts.

Even foods like snacks, chocolate, and cake, if eaten slowly and in small amounts, will cause blood sugar to rise gradually.

If blood sugar rises slowly, insulin does not need to be released urgently.

It prevents dizziness caused by low blood sugar due to excessive insulin release.

And if you eat this way, you won't gain weight even if you eat snacks, chocolate, or cake.

I will summarize.

When you reduce carbohydrates for dieting, insulin resistance improves.

In such situations, if you eat too many sweet foods like snacks, chocolate, and cake,

You may feel dizzy as your blood sugar drops.

Due to this dizziness, my craving for sweet foods has decreased or

Even if I eat sweet foods, I am changing to eat them slowly and in small amounts.

Such changes allow you to eat foods like snacks, chocolate, and cake without gaining weight.

It seems like my slim friend is always eating snacks that everyone envies.

It can be that you become friends.

Are you saying that even if you eat snacks, chocolate, and cake, you won't gain weight if you eat them slowly?

How does that work?

You said that eating a lot of carbohydrates can lead to obesity.

Looking at this photo, our ancestors used to be slim even though they ate a lot of carbohydrates like rice, right?

What do you think about this?

In a moment, two videos will appear on the screen.

On the left, there will be a video explaining why eating slowly does not lead to weight gain.

On the right, I will have a video explaining why our ancestors ate a lot but were still slim.

You can choose and watch the video that you're curious about between the two videos.
