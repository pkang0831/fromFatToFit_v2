The topic of this video is refined proteins and fats.

A question with the following content was posted in the comments.

I have something I'm curious about, Mr. pkang.

Mainly, everyone talks about refined carbohydrates.

Are refined fats and refined proteins okay?

I'm also curious if Diet Coke is okay.

You mentioned MCT oil as an example of refined fat.

Refined protein includes protein powder, which is an example of the supplements we commonly refer to.

The question is about refined fats and proteins, and since there are two things regarding Diet Coke.

I plan to answer over two videos.

In this video, we will talk about refined fats and proteins.

Among the videos I created earlier, there is one titled "Reasons for Gaining Weight."

When asked about the usual reasons for gaining weight, people often say it's because they eat a lot.

What I am talking about in this video is

It was said that the cause of increased appetite, which makes you want to eat a lot, is refined carbohydrates.

Eating refined carbohydrates leads to fluctuations in blood sugar levels and energy conversion issues, which continuously increases appetite.

Eating a lot of food due to increased appetite can lead to obesity.

On the contrary, if you reduce the intake of refined carbohydrates to eliminate increased appetite,

It means that you can eat a lot of food without becoming obese.

I don't eat excessively, so I naturally end up dieting as well.

If you are curious about the content of the video, you can check the video link that is displayed in the top right corner.

From this perspective, refined fats and proteins do not cause an increase in appetite.

So it may have an indirect effect on dieting.

It doesn't have a direct impact.

If we talk about it based on health rather than dieting, there are certain aspects that need to be taken into consideration.

Don't overthink it; just consider the characteristics of processed foods.

When a person eats food, it does not immediately turn into energy.

It needs to go through the process of digestion.

Unrefined foods are not processed, so it's difficult to eat a large amount at once.

It refers to foods that are slowly absorbed because they take a long time to digest.

Refined foods undergo processing to be convenient for consuming large quantities at once.

It refers to foods that are quickly absorbed by the body due to their short digestion time.

And this concept is no different for refined fats and refined proteins.

Refined protein is referred to as protein powder or supplements.

People who build muscle eat a lot.

The reason we eat in the first place is that it is processed in a way that makes it easy to consume, allowing us to eat a large quantity.

This is because the protein necessary for building muscle is absorbed quickly.

MCT oil is processed to be easy to consume, and it is said to be an advantage that it is quickly absorbed by the body.

Processed foods are not necessarily good or bad; it depends on the situation.

I have talked about the need to reduce the intake of refined carbohydrates in many videos, but...

This is based on dieting.

If refined carbohydrates quickly supply a lot of energy to the body, it can lead to obesity.

On the contrary, there are cases where a quick supply of energy is helpful.

A typical example is porridge.

Because it is made by using dead white rice as an ingredient and mashing it.

It has the characteristic of being able to eat a large amount at once and being well-digested and absorbed.

If you eat in unnecessary situations, you will become obese.

A situation where our body urgently needs energy.

For example, patients who are hospitalized are sometimes given porridge.

In such situations, it can be helpful.

Easy to eat, can consume a large amount, quickly absorbed.

If these characteristics can be applied as advantages, that would be great.

If such characteristics are considered disadvantages, it is not a good thing.

For example, I am working out hard and

The muscles in my body are growing quickly.

In this case, the body needs a lot of protein, right?

However, when I tried to eat unrefined protein,

Since it's meat, it needs to be grilled, steamed, or boiled, but given my situation, it's difficult to do that.

In such situations, supplements can be helpful.

However, taking supplements without exercising or

I am exercising, but I think that the more protein I have, the more muscle I will build.

Eating too much can lead to health problems.

The same goes for MCT oil.

If you need to quickly absorb fat into your body, this can be helpful.

If that's not the case, too much fat can lead to side effects from the fat.

So it is advisable to use it selectively according to the situation I am in.

Sounds plausible, right?

The link to the next video should be appearing in the top right corner.

In the next video, I will talk about the second question regarding Diet Coke.
