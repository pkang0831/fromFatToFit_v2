Fruit diet vs. the fructose in fruit turns into body fat immediately when consumed.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

There is a video I made in the past about how to distinguish different types of food.

This is a video that summarizes the most fundamental and essential aspects of dieting.

In that video, instead of blending the fruit with a blender or juicing it with a juicer,

It was mentioned that eating fruits on their own does not lead to weight gain.

However, I watched the video and understood the content, but...

Still, I feel anxious about eating fruit. There are many comments asking if it's okay to eat fruit.

I would like to talk more about fruits.

Since there is a lot of content that follows in the video about food classification,

It would be easier to understand the content if you watch the video on how to categorize food.

If anyone hasn't seen the video, the link is in the top right corner.

You can click to watch the video.

It is said that eating fruit can lead to weight gain because the fructose in fruit is directly stored as body fat.

Is it really okay to eat fruit? Can you diet while eating fruit?

This is the most frequently asked question about fruits.

First of all, the fructose in fruit is stored directly as body fat. That statement is correct.

Does that mean eating fruit makes you gain weight? Does fruit make us obese?

That's not the case.

These days, the number of people doing it has decreased a bit.

There was a trend for fruit-based diets centered around the internet for a while in the past.

It's a diet where all meals consist of fruits and vegetables.

Because I eat fruit as my main food without eating any other food.

The amount of fruit consumed was quite large.

At the very least, they would eat much more than someone who eats fruit while eating other foods.

Due to the condition of only eating fruits, there were issues with other side effects arising.

So now, the number of people doing it has decreased significantly.

It was certain that a fruit diet effectively reduces body fat and aids in weight loss.

There were already many testimonials proving the effectiveness of the diet from the beginning, and that's why it became popular.

The fructose in fruits is directly stored as body fat, and this is why we can become obese.

So if fruit is a fattening food,

It should not be possible to lose weight with a fruit diet that involves eating so much fruit.

However, that wasn't the case in reality.

This is because the body uses more fat than it stores as body fat from fruit.

Fruits have a high water content, so they are low in calories.

So if you only eat fruit, won't you end up losing weight due to a calorie deficit?

If you eat it with other foods, the total calories will increase.

I am worried that I might gain weight if that happens.

If the other foods mentioned in the question are processed refined foods like chicken, pizza, and cola, then...

Eating a lot of such foods and also consuming a lot of fruit can lead to weight gain.

Processed refined foods disrupt hormones, leading to abnormally increased appetite.

The human stomach has the characteristic of expanding when it feels strong hunger.

It makes you able to eat more even when you have already eaten enough food.

Eating a lot of processed foods increases appetite because of that.

Due to increased appetite, the stomach expands.

Due to the empty space created by the stomach expanding, people end up eating a lot of snacks, which leads to obesity.

However, in this case, the fruit is not the issue.

The problem lies in processed foods that disrupt hormones, increase appetite, and cause the stomach to expand.

In that case, what would happen if we eat unrefined foods and fruits together instead of refined foods?

I don't gain weight.

The biggest characteristic of unrefined foods is that they normalize appetite.

In a situation where appetite is normal, the stomach does not expand.

If the stomach does not expand, there is a limit to the amount of food that can be eaten.

If you eat a lot of fruit, the water content in the fruit will fill you up, causing you to eat less of other foods.

If you eat a lot of different foods, your stomach will be filled with those foods, so you can't help but eat less fruit.

If you eat a lot of fruit first and then eat less of other foods,

It is similar to the fruit dish shown at the beginning of the video.

Due to the high water content of fruits, they have fewer calories compared to the amount consumed.

So, compared to the body fat that increases from the fructose in fruit,

It is not that the body is gaining weight because it is consuming more body fat.

In the case where a lot of different foods are eaten and only a little fruit is consumed.

In this case, since I didn't eat a lot of fruit to begin with, I can't gain weight because of the fruit.

There is no food in this world that makes you gain weight just by eating a little.

Eating too much of any food can lead to weight gain.

I watched the video on how to distinguish food by pkang, and I am eating unrefined foods mentioned in that video.

However, even after eating a lot of unprocessed food, I still crave fruit and actually eat a lot of it.

Why am I like this?

This is a case where something is lacking in the diet.

The reason people eat food is to obtain the necessary nutrients.

So even if your appetite is normal, if you are lacking certain nutrients, you will continue to feel hungry.

For example, if you follow a ketogenic diet that severely restricts carbohydrates,

A lack of carbohydrates leads to an increase in appetite.

It's a craving that arises from a lack of carbohydrates.

So, you need to eat carbohydrates to solve it.

If you try to solve it by eating other foods without consuming carbohydrates,

A phenomenon of increasingly eating more food occurs.

As I mentioned at the beginning of the video.

If you have an appetite but your stomach is full, it will stretch your stomach.

In fact, among those who follow a ketogenic diet, there are people who eat more than 1 kg of meat a day.

I also tried the ketogenic diet, but I didn't eat up to 1 kg of meat.

The amount of carbohydrates needed varies from person to person, so there are people who have no issues.

And when a lack of carbohydrates leads to an increase in appetite,

To encourage the consumption of carbohydrates instead of meat.

There is a phenomenon where the meat becomes tough and tastes unpleasant.

Usually, at this stage, people either stop their diet or eat carbohydrates.

The meat that I can eat freely is tough and tasteless, and I want to eat carbohydrates.

A person who endures and continues to stick to their diet.

Such a person ends up eating more than 1 kg of meat.

Returning to the original story.

If you are eating a sufficient amount of unprocessed food but still can't control your appetite,

It means that something is lacking in my diet.

I have eaten enough unrefined foods within the same concept, but...

If you keep wanting to eat fruit and are actually eating a lot of fruit,

There is something lacking in my diet, and I am filling it with fruit.

So what should I do?

You can supplement what is lacking in my diet.

Sometimes, when there is a lack of carbohydrates, I want to eat fruit to get carbohydrates.

There are times when you crave fruit because you are lacking in vitamins and minerals that are abundant in fruits.

I eat a lot of vegetables, but can I still be lacking in vitamins and minerals?

If you only eat one type of vegetable continuously or only eat cooked vegetables, that can happen.

Not all vitamins and minerals are contained in a single vegetable.

Some vitamins and minerals can be lost when heat is applied.

So try to eat a variety of vegetables as much as possible.

It is good to eat raw vegetables along with cooked vegetables.

Usually, when we talk about a diet plan,

I am trying to decide on a specific food and only eat that.

That's not good for dieting.

Lastly, if your diet lacks sweetness, your craving for fruit may increase.

In this case, adding sweetness to the diet will solve the problem.

You want me to add sweetness?

Sugar raises blood sugar levels, so doesn't eating sugar prevent weight loss?

Too much sugar can cause such problems, but if it's not excessive, it won't be an issue.

I explained this in detail in another video.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have a video about sugar on the right.

Why it's okay to add sugar to your diet.

How much can I add without it being a problem?
