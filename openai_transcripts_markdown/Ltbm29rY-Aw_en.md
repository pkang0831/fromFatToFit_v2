Is it true that you can diet without exercise and avoid gaining weight back?

All videos have subtitles.

While diligently exercising and dieting,

There are quite a few cases where people gain weight after successfully dieting and stopping exercise.

The body has become accustomed to situations where energy is consumed through exercise.

In such a situation, stopping exercise leads to a phenomenon where energy remains.

This is one of the causes of yo-yoing.

If you don't plan to exercise for a lifetime,

There is a claim that dieting without exercise prevents yo-yo dieting.

What do you think about that claim? This question was posted in the comments.

Let's talk in detail.

You can avoid yo-yo dieting by losing weight without exercising.

For that story to hold, it must be possible to lose weight through diet alone, without exercise.

However, there are quite a few people who can't do that.

Body fat in humans is largely divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat refers to the fat located right next to the internal organs.

The only place in the human body where the internal organs are located is the abdomen.

So when there is an increase in visceral fat, the belly tends to swell up like a balloon.

Subcutaneous fat is the fat located just beneath the skin and is distributed throughout the body.

Because it is located just beneath the outermost layer of the skin.

When subcutaneous fat increases, it will sag and wobble due to gravity.

The fat that we commonly refer to as "body fat" and can be grasped with our hands is subcutaneous fat.

These two regions have different locations, and as a result, they have different functions.

Because the tasks are different, the methods of exclusion also vary.

Reducing visceral fat is effective through diet.

Subcutaneous fat is effectively reduced through exercise.

So, for people with a lot of body fat, the effectiveness of dieting through just diet alone is reduced.

Therefore, it is quite difficult to succeed in dieting with just a diet without exercise.

Why is diet effective for reducing visceral fat, while exercise is effective for reducing subcutaneous fat?

I previously made a detailed video explaining about visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

I will set up a link to go to the top right now.

For those who are curious about detailed information on visceral fat and subcutaneous fat, you can click here to see more.

So, does that mean that a person with a lot of body fat needs to exercise in order to lose that fat?

However, even if you lose weight like that, if you stop exercising, you'll gain the weight back again.

So are you saying I should exercise for a lifetime?

To conclude, that would be the story.

You need to exercise for a lifetime.

But why is there such a resistance to exercising for a lifetime?

I think it's difficult to exercise.

Thinking that I have to continue doing tough exercise for a lifetime makes it daunting.

However, exercise is essentially an extension of activity.

Exercise is not necessarily always difficult.

For example, walking in the park can also be a form of exercise.

It's an extension of walking, isn't it?

That's why walking is referred to as a form of exercise.

If there is no problem with someone's body.

No one says they never want to walk for the rest of their life just because walking is too difficult.

The reason exercise is difficult is that I choose challenging workouts.

If you don't choose a difficult workout, continuing it isn't such a burdensome task.

I know that starting with light exercise is good.

Progressive overload means that you need to gradually increase the intensity of your workouts.

So, in the end, don't we have to do tough exercises?

There are many misunderstandings about this part.

Increasing the intensity of exercise through progressive overload does not necessarily mean it will continue to become more difficult.

When you exercise, your muscles develop, and as your muscles develop, your athletic performance improves.

So when you repeat the same volume of exercise, that exercise starts to feel easier over time.

A typical example is the 30-day squat challenge.

For someone who has never exercised at all, doing 30 squats on the first day is tough.

If you consistently do squats for 30 days and can do 200 squats on the last day,

The 30 squats that were difficult on the first day are no longer a challenge.

So when I first started exercising, it was about a 10 in difficulty for me.

If you continue to exercise consistently, it gradually decreases until it becomes 1.

In this case, exercising is no longer difficult at all, and there are no changes in the body.

If you want to change your body a bit more here, you need to increase the intensity of your workouts.

When the intensity of the exercise increases, the level of difficulty goes back up to 10.

This is progressive overload.

So, just because you increase the intensity of your exercise...

The level of difficulty keeps increasing, reaching 10, 20, 30, and eventually, it's not just experiencing hell.

It was difficult at first, but I got used to it and became comfortable, then I increased the intensity of the exercise and went through the difficulty again.

Just because you exercise doesn't mean you have to apply progressive overload all the time.

As mentioned earlier, when the body adapts to exercise, there will no longer be any changes in the body.

At this time, in order to further change the body, the intensity of the exercise is increased.

So, until you succeed in your diet, you need to gradually increase the intensity of your exercise.

I succeeded in my diet and I am happy with my body now.

In that case, there is no need to increase the exercise intensity here.

You can just keep repeating that intensity of exercise.

If you keep repeating exercises of the same intensity, they will gradually become easier.

Later on, doing that exercise every day will become something trivial.

In this way, exercising for a lifetime becomes not that difficult of a task.

I know it's good to start with easy exercises and gradually increase the intensity.

However, if you do easy exercises, there is no effect on dieting.

And they say that exercise becomes familiar and easier.

No matter how easy it becomes, will it become nothing?

It seems like it would be harder to live like this without exercising.

First of all, quite a few people burn calories through exercise.

I think that much body fat will be lost for that amount of calories.

So when I exercise for the purpose of dieting, I try to do workouts that burn a lot of calories.

The problem is that a high calorie burn means that the exercise is difficult.

So, body fat will decrease as much as the calories burned through exercise. Because of this thought.

I think that easy exercises don't burn enough calories, so they don't help with dieting.

Many people think that you need to do intense exercise to burn a lot of calories and lose weight.

This is not it.

The reduction of body fat does not depend solely on the calories burned through exercise.

The act of exercising itself holds meaning.

The calories burned through exercise are not that important.

And when you consistently performed the same volume of exercise.

The degree to which you become accustomed to and comfortable with that exercise is much greater than you might think.

traditional tribes that actually live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and

When comparing the metabolic rate of office workers who sit in the office all day,

The results showed that there was no difference in the calories consumed in a day.

Wait a moment, I don't quite understand.

It's not that body fat decreases by the same amount of calories burned through exercise?

Are you saying that the daily metabolic rate of a hunter-gatherer tribe is the same as that of an office worker?

Is that really true?

Yes, it's true.

I talked about the reasons in detail in another video.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

A video on the left explaining why body fat does not decrease by the same amount as calories burned through exercise.

On the right, I will include a video explaining why the daily metabolic rate of a foraging tribe is the same as that of office workers.
