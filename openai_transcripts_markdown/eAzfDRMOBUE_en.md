If you starve, will your body break down muscle to use as energy? Part 2 of Basal Metabolic Rate.

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video about basal metabolic rate.

In the first part of the video, we talked about research indicating that basal metabolic rate does not decrease even when fasting.

In this video, I would like to talk about whether fasting breaks down muscle to use it as energy.

Since the content continues from Part 1 of the video,

It would help you understand the content better if you watch the videos in order from the beginning.

If you haven't watched the previous video, you can click the link in the top right to watch it.

In a situation where food is not available, the body stores fat as emergency food.

If you can't obtain food, your body will use body fat for energy, not break down muscle for energy.

This is a claim that was mentioned at the end of Part 1 of the video, and it is a valid point.

Unless you are someone with an enormous amount of muscle.

The breakdown of muscles to obtain energy does not happen often.

However, there are other reasons that can lead to muscle loss.

Muscles tend to grow the more they are used, and they gradually decrease when not used.

If you actually exercise and use your muscles a lot, your muscle mass will increase.

On the contrary, if you do not exercise, you will lose muscle.

So, the breakdown of muscle to obtain energy doesn't happen often.

If you follow a low-calorie diet or a starvation diet, your basal metabolic rate and exercise metabolic rate will decrease.

This means that muscle loss may occur because the level of activity and exercise has decreased.

If muscle mass decreases, strength will weaken, making it difficult to hunt.

Then, shouldn't all of humanity that struggled to find food have starved to death?

Solving that problem is a fight-or-flight response in stressful situations.

In the past, I briefly talked about it in a video titled "Stress is Not the Root of All Illness."

In the past, situations that caused stress for humanity were primarily life-threatening situations.

In such situations, there is a struggle to secure safety by defeating enemies that pose a threat to life.

In a dangerous situation, I had to choose one thing while escaping to secure my safety.

In stressful situations, physical abilities temporarily increase to favor fight or flight.

This is referred to as the fight-or-flight response to stress.

If you don't succeed in hunting, you will starve to death. However, you can also die in the process of hunting.

Stress in such extreme situations triggers the fight-or-flight response.

The increased physical abilities resulting from the fight-or-flight response are very helpful for hunting.

If you succeed in hunting, you can eat the prey, which provides a large amount of nutrients.

In this way, muscle mass increases and metabolism is restored, resolving the issues caused by hunger.

One interesting point is that this process is similar to exercise.

When you put stress on your body through exercise, a fight-or-flight response occurs.

Using the increased physical abilities gained from the fight-or-flight response, apply a strong load to the muscles.

Eating nutrient-rich foods increases muscle mass, which is the principle of exercise.

For reference, the process of building muscle through exercise takes a very long time at first.

When the muscle mass you were trying to increase has decreased.

It takes a relatively short time to recover from it.

If the period of not exercising extends, muscle mass decreases and exercise performance ability declines.

If I start exercising again and have enough meals,

I have a characteristic of recovering very quickly to the level of exercise I was originally doing.

I will summarize.

The human body stores body fat that is suitable for use as energy.

Unless in special cases, muscles are not broken down to obtain energy.

It is much more efficient to break down body fat rather than muscle.

However, if you starve yourself or follow a low-calorie diet, your activity level and exercise amount will decrease.

If the situation of reduced activity and exercise continues, it will lead to muscle loss.

Energy is generated during the process of muscle loss.

They say that muscles are broken down and used for energy.

It's not that we break down muscles to gain energy.

If you starve yourself or follow a low-calorie diet, there is a problem where muscle mass decreases like this.

Ancient humanity solved this problem through hunting.

Hunting triggers a fight-or-flight response.

When the body increases its physical abilities in response to fight or flight, it places a strong load on the muscles.

After applying such a strong load, if you consume the prey, it will provide a large amount of nutrients.

I can quickly recover to the muscle mass I originally had.

When muscle mass is restored, both the resting metabolic rate and the exercise metabolic rate will naturally recover as well.

The problem is that modern humanity does not hunt to obtain food.

If there is no hunting, there is no fight-or-flight response.

If there is no fight-or-flight response, then there is no strong load on the muscles.

If there is no strong load on the muscles, muscle mass will not increase again.

If muscle mass does not increase, both the resting metabolic rate and the exercise metabolic rate will not recover either.

So, modern humanity can easily obtain food without having to hunt.

Unable to solve the problems caused by hunger.

This is why people say that starving diets are not good.

However, there are so many discussions about how losing weight by starving is not good.

Why are there people who keep starving themselves to lose weight?

This is because problems do not become apparent initially.

In the next video, I will talk about this.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the third part of the basal metabolic rate video,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

If you found this video helpful, please subscribe and like it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
