Hello, this is pkang.

This is a video responding to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

The question consists of two sentences, but the actual inquiry involves four different points.

First, what is autophagy?

How effective is autophagy, in the second instance?

Do you need to practice intermittent fasting to activate autophagy?

Is autophagy effective for people who are not dieting?

Let's take a look at each one.

What is autophagy?

In simple terms, it is a phenomenon where aging cells consume themselves and become healthy cells again.

The human body is made up of countless cells, and when cells are first created, they are healthy, but...

As time passes, impurities accumulate and functionality decreases, and cells that have undergone this process are referred to as aging cells.

As the number of aging cells increases, the body gradually becomes weaker and various health problems arise.

This is the phenomenon of aging.

Aging weakens the body and leads to health problems, so it is essential to suppress it as much as possible for survival.

So the body tries to prevent aging in two ways.

The first method is cell death and cell division.

Cell death refers to the process by which a cell dies and ceases to exist.

Cell division is the process of creating new cells.

So, we eliminate senescent cells through apoptosis.

Fill that empty space with healthy cells created through cell division.

It reduces the number of aging cells and prevents aging.

The second method, which is the topic of this video, is autophagy.

It is a phenomenon where aging cells break themselves down, consume and absorb the components, and then recycle them to become healthy cells again.

Aging cells can become healthy cells, so they have the effect of preventing aging.

Both reactions share the similarity of transforming aging cells into healthy ones, but there is a significant difference between them.

In human DNA, there is something called telomeres, which shorten with each cell division.

When telomeres shorten beyond a certain length, cells stop dividing.

So, humans cannot undergo cell division indefinitely; there is a limit to the number of times cells can divide, which is determined by something called telomeres.

Once the telomeres are completely used up, the cells can no longer divide.

Since we cannot create new cells, we have to keep using aging cells.

This way, a person ages.

In order to prevent aging, we need to use telomeres sparingly.

What makes this possible is autophagy.

Autophagy does not involve cell division.

In a situation where the cell remains intact, only the contents inside the cell are broken down and absorbed.

Because it is recycled and transformed into healthy cells.

Aging cells can become healthy cells, but they have the characteristic of not losing their telomeres.

So, people who are still young and have ample telomeres...

Activating autophagy allows you to conserve telomeres, helping you maintain youth for a longer time.

A person who is older and has no telomeres.

Activating autophagy can transform aging cells into healthy ones, resulting in a rejuvenating effect.

Of course, that doesn't mean that one will never age or that an elderly person will become young again.

However, there is a certain degree of anti-aging effect.

How effective is the second autophagy?

To put it simply, it is clear that there is an effect, but there is no precise indicator.

The phenomenon of autophagy was discovered in the 1960s and was named autophagy, but it did not become very well-known at that time.

Japanese biologist Yoshinori Ohsumi received the Nobel Prize in 2016 for his research on autophagy.

I suddenly became famous.

The reason it became famous is because it received a Nobel Prize for its anti-aging method, which is referred to as a way to rejuvenate.

However, the research that won the Nobel Prize used yeast instead of the human body.

However, since human body experiments cannot be conducted, it doesn't mean that this experiment is strange.

There is no accurate indicator because there is simply no research data focused on people.

It's difficult to say exactly how effective it is.

However, considering the phenomenon of autophagy explained earlier, it can be clearly seen that it is effective.

Do you need to practice intermittent fasting to activate autophagy?

Many people have learned about autophagy through intermittent fasting.

Many people believe that autophagy is only activated through intermittent fasting.

Intermittent fasting is indeed one of the various methods that activate autophagy, but...

Intermittent fasting is not the only way to activate autophagy.

The activation of autophagy is more related to controlling meal portions than to intermittent fasting itself.

If we categorize meal portions into three levels, we can distinguish between eating more than needed, eating just the right amount, and eating less than needed.

When you eat more than the necessary amount, your body ends up with an excess of nutrients and energy.

Autophagy is essentially a type of conservation response that recycles cells.

If the body is overflowing with nutrients and energy, there is no need to conserve.

The recycling of existing cells through autophagy is suppressed.

The process of apoptosis and division is activated, killing aging cells and creating new ones.

On the contrary, if you eat insufficiently, the energy entering your body will decrease.

If this situation lasts for a long time, the body will try to reduce energy expenditure in order to survive.

If there are many cells in the body, a lot of energy is consumed to maintain these cells, so the body tries to reduce the number of cells.

It is said that dieting by starving can lead to muscle loss and weaken internal organs, resulting in a decrease in basal metabolic rate.

It is a phenomenon that occurs due to a decrease in the number of cells that make up muscles and internal organs.

This phenomenon is called the hunger response.

In the case of autophagy, it is not about reducing the number of cells.

Since it involves recycling while maintaining the cells as they are,

In the starvation response aimed at reducing the number of cells, autophagy is inhibited and apoptosis, which kills cells, is activated.

So, autophagy is suppressed in both situations of eating a lot and eating insufficiently.

It is activated only in situations where you eat appropriately.

It is said that intermittent fasting activates autophagy.

Mr. pkang says that if food intake is insufficient, autophagy is suppressed?

First of all, a situation where food intake is insufficient leads to the suppression of autophagy.

It refers to a situation where a long period of insufficient food intake leads to a hunger response.

Intermittent fasting includes periods of not eating, but since it does not exceed 24 hours, hunger responses do not occur.

The purpose of intermittent fasting is not simply to starve oneself.

As a method of restricting meal times

The goal is to reduce the amount of food that was being eaten excessively to a proper portion.

So, by using intermittent fasting and having an appropriate amount of meals, autophagy is activated.

In other words, autophagy can be activated not only through intermittent fasting but also by consuming an appropriate amount of food.

Even if you have three meals a day, there are ways to avoid overeating or to eat unrefined foods.

Is autophagy effective for people who are not on a diet for the last time?

Autophagy is effective regardless of dieting because it transforms aging cells into healthy cells.

In summary, when autophagy is activated, it conserves telomeres, which has an anti-aging effect.

The effects of autophagy apply to everyone, regardless of age—whether they are older or younger—and regardless of body weight, whether obese, underweight, or of normal weight.

The most well-known method for activating autophagy is intermittent fasting, but...

Autophagy is activated as long as you do not overeat or undereat, so it is not necessary to practice intermittent fasting.

Sounds plausible, right?
