Hello, this is pkang.

This is a video responding to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

I am following the conditions mentioned in the video and eating 400g of meat and fruit in one meal. However, I am gaining weight. Why is this happening?

First, let me explain a little about that question.

The cause of obesity, in my opinion, is overeating, which is consuming food unnecessarily in large amounts.

The cause of overeating, which is eating excessively, is

It is a rapid increase in blood sugar due to refined carbohydrates.

When blood sugar levels rise sharply, it can lead to fluctuations in blood sugar and issues with energy conversion, resulting in false hunger.

If you eat food when you are experiencing false hunger, it can lead to overeating.

As a result, it leads to obesity.

On the contrary, if we reduce our intake of refined carbohydrates such as white rice, sugar, and flour,

Because blood sugar does not rise sharply.

There are no issues with blood sugar fluctuations or energy conversion.

This way, there will be no unnecessary overeating, and naturally, it leads to weight loss.

I understand that not overeating prevents weight gain, but...

Isn't it necessary to eat less in order to diet?

How can I lose weight if I'm eating enough not to feel hungry?

The goal of all living beings, including humans, is survival.

The body adjusts its metabolism according to the situation to favor survival.

Obesity is a condition where there is too much body fat accumulated in the body.

Accumulated body fat like this can have a negative impact on the body itself.

If you have a lot of accumulated body fat, your body feels heavy, which reduces your activity level and is not advantageous for survival.

So I keep trying to reduce the body fat I have to gain an advantage for survival.

So as long as you don't overeat, body fat will naturally decrease.

You may know that patients with severe obesity who weigh a lot tend to experience stronger effects from dieting.

Because there is a tendency in the body to reduce body fat.

As obesity progresses, it becomes increasingly severe.

So, individuals with severe obesity initially experience a strong effect from dieting.

For those who want to go from a normal weight to underweight, dieting is very difficult.

So it is not necessarily the case that you have to eat while feeling hungry in order to lose weight.

If that's true, why do people fail at dieting?

The most common dieting method is the calorie restriction diet, which involves reducing meal portions.

When we receive news, our bodies respond in a way that is advantageous for survival, according to the situation.

Here's how it will proceed.

A person who is currently obese needs to reduce body fat for survival.

So every day, my body automatically consumes a certain amount of body fat.

The body receives energy from the body fat that has been consumed in that way.

Even if I eat less than the amount I should be eating, I still feel sufficiently full.

The situation is based on the absence of false hunger.

Therefore, individuals who follow a diet that reduces refined carbohydrates tend to show a significant decrease in their meal portions.

When I calculate the calories, I find that my body's calorie needs are not being met.

However, I don't feel hungry even after doing that.

There is energy that comes from body fat that breaks down on its own.

However, if I become overly ambitious about my diet and reduce my meal portions,

We know that there is food around us.

Knowing that I am not eating because of my diet

I know that I can eat whenever I want.

Our body doesn't know this fact.

So I interpret the decrease in food intake as a situation where it is difficult to obtain food right now.

In that case, I am currently in a situation where it is difficult for me to obtain food.

What should I do to survive here?

We need to reduce body fat consumption.

You need to conserve body fat until the next food arrives, as it is advantageous for survival.

The body fat that was naturally decreasing will stop decreasing.

And I try to lower my body's metabolism to minimize the consumption of body fat as much as possible.

This is what is commonly referred to as the hunger response.

Dieting by starving yourself can lead to a rebound effect when you start eating again.

So, the best diet method that I think is

First, reduce the intake of refined carbohydrates.

It is about eliminating false hunger signals in the body.

Then I will be able to trust the signals my body sends when it is hungry.

After making that signal reliable,

When you are hungry, eat food to prevent the response of starvation.

When you are full, you don't eat, which helps prevent overeating.

If we make this a rule, it will become the three rules that were mentioned in the question.

Avoid refined carbohydrates.

If you're hungry, eat; if you're full, don't eat.

I mainly eat unprocessed foods such as vegetables, fruits, and meat.

The person who asked the question said that they are following these three rules.

They are eating 400g of meat in one meal and additionally consuming fruit, and they report that their weight is increasing.

In addition to the information written, how many meals do you eat in a day, and how much fruit do you consume?

There is no information on whether the weight gain is due to an actual increase in body fat or an increase in water.

It is difficult to answer accurately, but...

First, let's assume that body fat has increased.

I will try to infer the cause based only on the information provided in the question.

First of all, 400g of meat is quite a large amount, but...

It's not an amount that you can't eat if you only eat meat.

A real steak for men is sold in a portion of 400g.

However, this is only about eating meat.

Or it is possible only when you eat a little as a garnish, even if you eat vegetables.

When eating a quantity of meat similar to the amount of vegetables and fruits, it is an amount that cannot be consumed.

Because there is too much.

Looking back at the question, the weight of the meat is accurately indicated as g.

There is no mention of vegetables at all, and it does not specify how much fruit is consumed.

So I think that probably eating 400g of meat without any vegetables...

I think they eat a little fruit afterwards as a palate cleanser.

In this case, the amount of meat consumed is high, but...

There is a problem of insufficient carbohydrate intake from vegetables and fruits.

Reducing carbohydrate intake is advised.

It's not that carbohydrates are harmful to the body, so you shouldn't eat them.

Because refined carbohydrates are the problem.

The idea is to avoid refined carbohydrates and consume unrefined carbohydrates like vegetables and fruits.

Such unrefined carbohydrates have a very low carbohydrate content.

So you need to eat a large amount.

It is better to eat a larger quantity of food than meat, if possible.

If it's difficult, please at least eat a similar amount to meat.

So if you are not eating vegetables, it is advisable to start eating them.

If the amount of vegetables and fruits is too small compared to the meat, try reducing the amount of meat and increasing the amount of vegetables or fruits.

The second possibility.

I am eating vegetables or fruits in amounts similar to meat, but even so, if I am still consuming about 400g of meat...

The meat you are eating may be processed meat rather than fresh meat.

The reason refined carbohydrates are problematic is that they can lead to various health issues.

Because it is processed, it can be easily consumed in large quantities, and digestion and absorption are quick.

Processed meats such as patties, ham, and sausages made from ground or minced meat are also included.

It becomes a problem because it is easy to consume a large amount, and digestion and absorption are very quick.

If the meat you are eating is processed meat, please eat unprocessed raw meat instead.

If this is not it either, then...

The remaining possibility is if too much sauce or seasoning containing refined carbohydrates is being added.

Since you mentioned that you are reducing your intake of refined carbohydrates, I don't think this is the case.

If you are adding a lot of sauce or seasoning,

You are putting in too much, so it is having the same effect as consuming refined carbohydrates, so you need to reduce the amount.

I will summarize.

If you are not eating enough vegetables or fruits, please increase your intake of vegetables and fruits.

If you are eating processed meat, please switch to fresh meat instead.

If you are using a lot of sauce, how about reducing the amount a bit?

Sounds plausible, right?
