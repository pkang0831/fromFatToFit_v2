Reasons Why You Don't Lose Weight Even When You Stick to Your Diet - Satiety Part 3

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video in the series about creating a feeling of fullness, in response to comments about wanting to lose weight but eating too much food.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about eating habits that can lead to overeating without even realizing it.

In the second part of the video, we talked about the trap of fake fullness in foods that give a sense of satiety.

In this video, I would like to talk about how to resolve fake bloating.

Since the content of the video continues from Part 1, it is recommended to watch it in order from the beginning.

If you haven't watched the previous video, please click the link in the top right.

You can look at them in order.

To summarize what was discussed in the second part of the video:

Among carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, any of these nutrients can provide a feeling of fullness.

So, food that contains only specific nutrients is referred to as food that provides a feeling of fullness.

Leafy vegetables, which contain no fat or protein and only carbohydrates, are said to be foods that provide a feeling of fullness.

A drink made by adding only fat to coffee without carbohydrates and protein is called a bulletproof coffee that provides a feeling of fullness.

It is said that chicken breast, which contains only protein without carbohydrates and fat, is a food that provides a feeling of fullness.

The problem is that people trying to feel full with leafy greens...

I think that protein and fat are not good for dieting.

People who seek satiety from bulletproof coffee

I think carbohydrates and proteins are not good for dieting.

So in a situation where you are following such a diet, if you feel an increased hunger and want to eat more...

I'm trying to solve that feeling of hunger by eating more of the food I usually eat.

This becomes a problem.

For example, there is a salad diet that consists solely of eating leafy greens.

Leafy vegetables can provide volume and carbohydrates, but they do not provide fats and proteins.

First of all, if any one of the three—carbohydrates, fats, or proteins—is satisfied, a feeling of fullness occurs.

The salad diet plan is quite filling in the beginning.

However, as time goes by, I increasingly feel hunger due to a lack of fat and protein.

Even though I've eaten plenty of salad, I still feel like I want to eat something.

It is a phenomenon that occurs due to a deficiency of other nutrients such as protein or fat.

I think it's effective for dieting to avoid eating protein and fat.

There are cases where people try to solve their hunger by eating more leafy vegetables.

However, the reason for feeling hungry is due to a lack of protein and fat.

Eating more leafy greens won't solve the problem.

Because the problem is not resolved, I also start to feel hungry again.

If you try to solve this by eating more leafy greens, you will end up eating more and more leafy greens.

The same goes for 지방.

When I first tried bulletproof coffee, it was a drink that kept me feeling full for a long time.

So many people drink bulletproof coffee instead of having a meal.

However, this also has a good effect at first, but over time, its effectiveness gradually decreases.

Even though I drank bulletproof coffee, I quickly lost my feeling of fullness and wanted to eat something.

So among those who have been drinking bulletproof coffee for a long time, there are many reports that the effects have diminished.

This is also a phenomenon that occurs due to a lack of other nutrients like carbohydrates and proteins.

There are many cases where people try to solve it by increasing calories.

You can drink bulletproof coffee more often or change the oil you add to the bulletproof coffee.

When bulletproof coffee was first introduced in the country, the basic recipe included coconut oil.

However, for some time now, recipes that include MCT oil have been commonly known.

The reason for using coconut oil in the first place is

This is because the medium-chain fatty acids in coconut oil are quickly digested and absorbed.

MCT oil is an oil that is extracted and refined from medium-chain fatty acids.

It is digested and absorbed faster than coconut oil.

It's an oil designed to provide calories more quickly and in greater amounts.

If it's a diet that includes specific nutrients, does that mean those symptoms are inevitable?

No, that's not the case.

The amount of calories and nutrients needed varies from person to person.

Even if certain nutrients are somewhat restricted, it can still be suitable for your current body condition.

In cases where there is a lot of body fat, following a diet that restricts fat is not a problem.

So if you are satisfied with the diet you are currently following and don't feel any particular issues, that's fine.

However, even though I clearly ate a lot of food and I'm full, I still have a desire to eat something.

It's not a pleasant feeling of fullness; it feels uncomfortable because my stomach is too full.

I think it's strange how much food I'm eating.

If you feel something strange about yourself, you should check why that is.

Having such symptoms indicates that there is an issue with the diet.

The method of checking is simple.

You can try adding a little more of the nutrients that were originally restricted.

For example, if you follow a ketogenic diet that severely restricts carbohydrates for an extended period of time,

As the craving for carbohydrates increases, you may find yourself wanting to eat something even after consuming a lot of food.

However, in a ketogenic diet, carbohydrates are restricted.

Rather than eating more carbohydrates, eat more meat or fat.

Many people often eat special snacks called keto snacks between meals.

If you had eaten a sufficient amount of food in the first place, it would be normal not to have a desire for snacks.

It's a bit strange to have a dedicated snack at this point.

In severe cases, there are instances where one might eat 500g of meat in a single meal.

If you have such a person add just 100g of sweet potato to their usual meal,

I often can't even eat half of the meat I usually do because I'm so full.

I was suppressing my cravings caused by a lack of carbohydrates with more meat.

As I eat a certain amount of carbohydrates, the craving for carbohydrates diminishes.

You no longer need to eat a lot of meat.

A diet that consists only of leafy greens or one that focuses primarily on chicken breast is the same.

When I added a little fat and ate it.

If you find it difficult to eat the usual amount and feel sufficiently full even when eating less than usual,

Hunger caused by a lack of fat.

The story is about overeating in order to fill up on leafy greens or chicken breast.

In summary, people need carbohydrates, fats, and proteins all together.

It is better to eat a balanced diet rather than overly restricting any particular nutrient.

If you forcefully impose restrictions, problems will arise in some form.

Overeating itself can become a habit, and there are cases where a plateau occurs due to overeating.

It's fascinating that a plateau occurs when certain nutrients are restricted.

I would like to know more about stagnation.

I covered the stagnation period in detail in a series of videos I created earlier.

There are some parts that overlap with the content of this video.

If you are curious about the details of the stagnation period, you can refer to the stagnation period series videos.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will set it up so that the traffic jam series appears on the right.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
