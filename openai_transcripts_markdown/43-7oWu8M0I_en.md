The topic of this video is whether carbohydrates are the most commonly used source of energy.

I received a comment on a video I recently posted, and the content is about

If carbohydrates are converted into glucose and then become fat,

Doesn't consuming fat lead to fat accumulation?

Glucose is the most commonly burned energy source.

Shouldn't we be eating more carbohydrates than fats, like around 250g a day?

I eat more than 200g a day, is that not okay?

You left a question with this content, and this is the response video to it.

You mentioned glucose as a heavily used energy source, but since you compared it to fat...

It seems that the intention of the question was to talk about carbohydrates.

If we break the question into two parts,

Is the first carbohydrate the most commonly used source of energy?

The second question is, does consuming fat lead to fat accumulation?

I think it combines these two questions.

So, we will discuss each question over the course of two videos.

I will talk about whether carbohydrates are the most commonly used source of energy.

If you are curious about whether consuming fat leads to fat accumulation,

Among the sports knowledge that used to be very famous in the past,

If you want to lose weight through exercise, it is said that you should exercise for at least 30 minutes or more.

The reason there was such a story is that

For the first 30 minutes of exercise, carbohydrates are burned.

Fat burning begins after 30 minutes.

It is said that in order to burn fat, you need to exercise for at least 30 minutes.

However, this is not actually the case, and upon closer examination, it turns out that...

When you start exercising, carbohydrates and fats are burned together.

Carbohydrates have a high usage rate at first, but over time, the usage rate gradually decreases.

The usage rate of fat is initially low, but it gradually increases over time.

It is said that the point at which the usage rates of carbohydrates and fats intersect was around 20 to 30 minutes.

So there has been talk that the usage of fat increases around the 20 to 30-minute mark.

As the story got distorted, it was said just 30 minutes ago that fat burning does not occur.

There are hardly any people who think this way now.

Now, when you start exercising, you know that carbohydrates and fats are burned together.

I looked into why this phenomenon occurs in the body.

Carbohydrates can be seen as an energy source that ignites easily, like newspaper.

It can significantly increase usage rates, allowing for a sudden burst of power.

On the contrary, it has a characteristic of decreased durability.

Fat can be compared to firewood.

I can't quickly ignite the fire, so I can't drastically increase the usage rate, and I can't exert a lot of force all at once.

Once it catches fire, it can be maintained at a high usage rate.

If a lot of strength is needed in a short amount of time in the human body, carbohydrates are used.

In energy that is continuously used, fat is utilized.

Then, among the energy that our body uses,

If we look at which type of energy is needed more, between energy that is used continuously and energy that requires a sudden burst of power,

You can determine whether the usage of carbohydrates is higher or the usage of fats is higher.

The daily energy used by our body is divided into three categories: basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate.

What is basal metabolic rate?

Basal metabolic rate: Energy used for maintaining life. It is primarily used by internal organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs, as well as for maintaining body temperature.

It refers to the energy used for sustaining life.

Energy used in internal organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

It refers to the energy used for maintaining body temperature.

For adult men in their 20s, the daily basal metabolic rate is said to be around 1600 kcal.

The consumption of basal metabolic rate does not require a large amount all at once.

I need it continuously in small amounts throughout the day.

Because if body temperature is not maintained, a person can die.

When the heart and brain stop, one dies.

So, you can think of the basal metabolic rate as primarily using fat as the main energy source.

The second is the activity metabolic rate.

Active metabolic rate: The energy expended during daily activities.

This refers to the energy consumed in daily life.

It refers to the energy used from the time you wake up in the morning, wash up, get ready, commute to work, and report on your tasks, until you come home after work.

The activity metabolic rate is said to be about 30% of the basal metabolic rate for individuals who are not very active.

If we take a person with a basal metabolic rate of 1600 kcal as a reference, their activity metabolic rate would be around 480 kcal.

When we talk about daily life, let's assume that we are active for about 10 hours a day.

If you are active for 10 hours and burn 480 kcal, that means you burn 48 kcal per hour.

This also cannot be considered a vigorous activity.

So you can see that the basal metabolic rate primarily uses fat.

Finally, exercise metabolic rate refers to the energy expended during physical activity.

This refers to energy that is used intensely.

When exercising vigorously for one hour, the energy used is about 500 kcal.

As explained earlier, in the first 30 minutes, the usage of carbohydrates is higher.

After 30 minutes, the amount of fat used increases even more.

This should be seen as an intermediate rather than primarily using carbohydrates and fats as the main energy sources.

In that case, the energy our body uses in a day consists of three components: basal metabolic rate, activity, and exercise metabolism.

When examining which of these three serves as the primary energy source, it turns out that most of them are fats.

So the energy that our body uses the most is fat.

So, isn't it possible that our bodies have evolved to store carbohydrates in small amounts and fats in larger amounts?

Sounds plausible, right?
