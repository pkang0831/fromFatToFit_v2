Is a snack with 1g of sugar a snack that won't make you gain weight?

Hello, this is pkang.

Recently, a question of this nature was posted in the comments.

When you want to binge on snacks while dieting.

I was eating a snack with 20g of carbohydrates and 1g of total sugars without any guilt.

Since it's only 1g of sugar, I ate it without any guilt.

I suddenly became curious about what the rest of the ingredients are if there is 1g of sugar, so I looked at the ingredients.

Then it turned out to be corn starch and potato starch.

I found out that this type of starch also raises blood sugar quickly.

How can there be 1g of sugar?

I heard that stir-frying cabbage, carrots, onions, and bell peppers can quickly raise blood sugar levels.

Is this really true?

In this video, I will talk about this question.

Recently, there is a strong perception that carbohydrates that rapidly raise blood sugar levels are a cause of obesity in dieting.

So, reduce the intake of carbohydrates themselves or

It is said that if you are going to eat carbohydrates, you should choose good carbohydrates that do not raise blood sugar levels quickly and significantly.

With this perception in mind, if we look at the nutrition label of food,

The word "sugar" is the first one that stands out.

This corresponds to "total sugars" that was mentioned in the question comment.

I don't know the exact meaning of "sugar," but the character for "sugar" itself signifies sweetness.

Among carbohydrates, we tend to think of sugars that raise blood sugar levels.

So, people come to think of foods high in sugar as fattening foods.

This kind of thinking leads to the idea that foods low in sugar are foods that won't make you gain weight.

In fact, that's not the case.

Carbohydrates are made up of dietary fiber and sugars.

Dietary fiber is a type of carbohydrate that is not digested or absorbed.

Carbohydrates refer to substances that are made up of sugars.

So, what are sugars?

It refers to monosaccharides and disaccharides, which relatively quickly raise blood sugar levels among carbohydrates.

So, among carbohydrates, there is something called sugars.

It means that this type of sugar raises blood sugar levels the fastest and the most.

However, other carbohydrates that are not sugars also contribute to raising blood sugar levels.

Even if the sugar content is low, if the carbohydrate content is high, it cannot prevent blood sugar from rising.

In simple terms, even if the sugar content is low, foods that are high in carbohydrates can lead to weight gain.

There is a way to immediately understand how meaningless the sugars listed on the nutrition label are.

You can search for the nutritional information of your favorite snacks or ramen.

I personally like snacks in the potato chip category.

If I search for the snacks I used to eat often,

The carbohydrate content is 15g per 30g of snacks, and the sugar content is less than 1g.

Since the total content is 60g,

If you eat a whole bag of that snack, you will consume 30g of carbohydrates and less than 2g of sugars.

If you only think about sugar, this snack shouldn't be considered fattening.

The ramen is indeed similar.

In the case of spicy ramen, which is commonly eaten in Korea,

The total carbohydrates are 80g, but the sugars are only 4g.

Ramen is indeed low in sugar.

But are snacks like these or ramen foods that don't make you gain weight?

Of course, that's not the case.

Although they contain little sugar, they have a lot of carbohydrates, which is why snacks and instant noodles can make you gain weight.

If there is no carbohydrate information on the nutrition label, how can I tell if the food is high in carbohydrates?

As mentioned at the beginning of the video,

Everything except dietary fiber in carbohydrates is considered sugars.

Snacks and ramen contain very little dietary fiber.

You can think of all the carbohydrates in the nutrition label as sugars.

So, should I remember that the problem lies with carbohydrates minus dietary fiber?

Processed refined foods are not good for dieting. Unprocessed whole foods are better.

You can remember it like this.

Foods that are rich in dietary fiber are, in the first place, unprocessed vegetables or fruits.

Such unrefined foods have a low total amount of carbohydrates.

There's no need to calculate it.

The calculation of carbohydrates is necessary for processed foods.

Most processed foods lack dietary fiber.

There are some products that do contain dietary fiber, but...

The amount of dietary fiber is extremely low compared to total carbohydrates.

It would be easier for you to think of simply being cautious about processed foods or foods that are high in carbohydrates.

Stir-frying the second vegetable can quickly raise blood sugar levels.

This is a true story.

There is a video I made in the past titled [If You Make Weight-Loss Foods This Way, You'll Gain Weight].

In that video, it was mentioned that the act of cooking food over fire itself increases digestion and absorption.

In fact, vegetables are digested and absorbed better when cooked rather than eaten raw.

If that's the case, does stir-frying vegetables make them a food that quickly raises blood sugar and leads to weight gain?

This is obviously not the case.

This is also a topic that was covered in a video I made earlier.

[Foods That Are Misunderstood as Fattening] in the video.

I mentioned that there is a difference between blood sugar rising quickly and blood sugar being very high.

In the video, the process of dissolving sugar in water to make sugar water was used as an example.

Even if sugar dissolves quickly in water, making the water sweet quickly,

If the amount of sugar added is small, the water does not become very sweet.

If you want to make the water much sweeter, you need to add a lot of sugar.

So how sweet does the water become?

The amount of sugar determines the maximum height of this sweetness.

How quickly can we reach the maximum height of the determined sweetness?

The speed that determines this is the rate at which sugar dissolves in water.

So, it is true that when you stir-fry vegetables, the speed at which the carbohydrates in the vegetables raise blood sugar levels increases.

Because it was cooked over fire.

However, the amount of carbohydrates in vegetables is low, so

The maximum level of blood sugar that can rise is low.

It only rises quickly to that low height.

So it's not a food that raises blood sugar significantly.

Dieting is so complicated and difficult. Do I have to memorize all of this?

No, that's not the case.

If you keep gathering and organizing these stories, you eventually reach the conclusion that processed foods are the problem.

As mentioned in the video on [how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods],

Have you processed foods that are slow to digest and absorb to make them digest and absorb faster?

Has the food that couldn't be eaten in large quantities been processed so that it can be eaten in larger amounts?

Depending on whether the food is processed or not, it can be classified as fattening or weight-loss food.

If you just categorize and eat according to those standards, there's no need to think too complicatedly.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will place the video on how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods on the right.

For those who haven't watched the video, I hope it will be helpful once you do.
