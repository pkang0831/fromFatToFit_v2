The topic of this video is pkang.

So, this is about the low-carb, high-fat diet that I am following.

First, to avoid confusion, let me clarify something.

Before making this video, I created two videos about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

The first video I created is titled "Understanding the Low-Carb, High-Fat Diet."

In this video, I explained the theory that forms the basis of a low-carb, high-fat diet.

I mentioned that any diet can be classified as a low-carb, high-fat diet as long as it meets this condition.

There are various derivative diets created by adding one's own theories while meeting these conditions.

I mentioned that although these diets share the name low-carb, high-fat diet, they are all different diets.

Atkins, ketogenic, paleo... These diets are all different from each other, and their conditions are also different.

The fundamental theory is the same, but the additional theories above are different.

There are often cases where our conditions clash. In fact, my diet is one of them.

However, I studied a bit about the low-carb, high-fat diet.

I am doing it, or those who are confident enough to explain it to others.

Many people are unaware of these differences and that they need to be distinguished.

So unnecessary fights can break out.

Alternatively, from the perspective of someone who is starting a low-carb, high-fat diet for the first time,

Since we learn by mixing theories, there are often cases where the different terminology causes confusion.

I created this video to be helpful in this regard.

There should be a link appearing in the top right corner of the video now.

What this is about is

What we call language, however,

Languages include both Korean and English, right?

However, Korean and English are both languages, but they are different.

Korean and English are not the same, right? It's the same concept.

What is an unnecessary fight?

I have a friend who is studying Korean.

But to such a friend, a child asked, "Are you studying languages while doing ㄱㄴㄷㄹ?"

Isn't it obvious that you have to do abcd to study a language? That's what I'm saying.

This is an unreasonable action.

The only language I know is English. So, anything other than English is not a language.

If you just say that Korean, Japanese, Chinese, German... are not languages at all, then...

This is a very stubborn behavior.

However, there are many people who experience this when following a low-carb, high-fat diet.

"In a diet that I know of, it said that you shouldn't eat more than a certain amount of carbohydrates."

But you're eating more than that. So your diet isn't low-carb, high-fat.

Well, since it meets the fundamental theory, you can use the name low-carb high-fat.

However, just because it differs from what I know, it leads to an attack.

I hope you won't do that because this is a meaningless fight.

For those who are encountering a low-carb, high-fat diet for the first time,

Even though they share the same name, they are different diets, which can lead to situations where two or three theories are mixed together in learning.

Then a strange hybrid diet is created.

If we use a metaphor related to language, consonants are learned in Korean, while vowels are learned in English.

I want to write 가, but I end up writing ㄱA.

This is neither Korean nor English. It has become something that isn't even a language.

To prevent this confusion, I created this video.

The second video I made after that is titled "How to Implement a Low-Carb, High-Fat Diet."

In this video, I will provide a brief explanation of the diet I am following.

As I have been following a low-carb, high-fat diet, I've encountered several issues that many people often mention. I provided solutions to those problems through a Q&A format.

After watching this video, someone said

After watching both videos, I feel that I need to differentiate my diet.

What is the low-carb, high-fat diet that Ronka is following? That's the question they asked.

This is a video explaining the conditions and rules of the diet I am following.

The diet I am following is different from the well-known popular diets.

There are often cases where things that are prohibited in that diet are allowed.

At first, I thought about introducing it as a variation of a specific diet, but then...

I think it might be unnecessarily confusing.

I will completely rename it as the "pkang Diet."

In the case of the Longo diet, there are two rules.

The first condition is to eat meat, vegetables, and fruits, but there are no restrictions on the types and amounts.

This is the first rule.

Many of you may be feeling puzzled after hearing this.

Fruits can be sweet, and they can also cause weight gain and raise blood sugar levels when eaten.

Some people might wonder if it's okay to eat this without any restrictions.

For those who have studied dieting a bit,

Among vegetables, root vegetables like carrots and onions are said to have a high GI index and a high carbohydrate content.

You might be wondering if eating it will raise your blood sugar and cause weight gain.

Before I made this video, there was a video titled "Do fruits raise blood sugar levels?"

In this video, I talk about the errors associated with the GI index. Because there are errors in the GI index.

Fruits, onions, and carrots are classified as foods that raise blood sugar levels, but

In reality, it is not a food that significantly raises blood sugar levels. I explained this in detail.

There should be a link appearing at the top right now.

If you're curious about the content of the video, please click the link to watch it.

Many people think that they can eat an enormous amount of fruit.

When you actually eat it, even if you eat a lot, you still feel hungry.

Because fruits are made up of 80-90% water.

When I eat, my stomach fills up and I feel full, but then I find myself wanting to eat more meat.

If you eat naturally, it tends to balance out to eating meat and a little bit of fruit.

At first, I liked fruit, so I thought I should eat fruit for a few days.

Sometimes when you eat, you can get tired of the fruit.

As the seasons change, there will be fruits that become hard to find.

As a result, I can't keep eating just fruit continuously. It's not sustainable naturally.

And in the case of vegetables, it is often recommended to eat a lot of them because dietary fiber is good for constipation.

Vegetables have a large volume, making it difficult to eat a lot of them.

If you force yourself to eat a lot, it can lead to constipation due to excessive dietary fiber.

So I can't eat a lot of vegetables either.

And you might ask if it's not okay to eat too much meat.

When I first started this diet, I was eating three meals a day.

I ate 250g of meat in one meal.

I was eating a total of 750g of meat a day, which is quite a large amount.

At first, I ate like that, but after about a week or two passed,

I feel like there is too much meat.

So I reduced the amount of meat.

Until it doesn't feel like there is a lot.

So later on, the total amount I ate in a day decreased to about 300g.

As I continued eating like that, I lost some weight, and when I started exercising to take care of my body,

I feel weak and like I want to eat more meat, as if I'm lacking energy.

I am currently increasing my meat intake to about 500g a day.

What this is saying is to listen to what your body is telling you.

When we talk about a typical diet plan, we usually refer to what to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

It's easy to think that you have to eat even if you don't want to, and that you should endure and eat even if there's not enough.

That's actually an impossible story.

Everyone is different, right?

Everyone has different heights and weights.

The ratio of muscle to fat is different.

The living environment is different.

The amount of exercise and activity levels are different.

The nutrients and calories needed by the body are all different.

How could there be a fixed diet that works perfectly for everyone?

And even if such a diet exists,

My body keeps changing.

The fat that was abundant in my body will decrease.

If there were too many muscles, I would reduce them.

If you exercise, your muscles will grow.

Then, the nutrients and calories my body needs will keep changing each time.

It's right to change it every time.

Choosing one and sticking to it without changing it is itself a form of stubbornness.

In the first place, the human body needs nutrients or calories if...

Some foods are designed in a way that makes you crave them.

If you have too much, you'll end up wanting to stop eating.

So if you eat according to what your body originally wants, there are no issues.

In the middle, a carbohydrate called grains appears, which rapidly raises blood sugar levels.

This basic structure is collapsing.

Because the blood sugar is rising too rapidly,

So that side effect leads to obesity.

So the idea of removing this is the basic concept of a low-carb, high-fat diet.

I have removed the grains that cause confusion in my body.

My body will gradually try to return to normal.

When the body returns to normal, the obesity that was caused by side effects will disappear.

There are people who are very concerned about calories.

Everyone, it's important to remember that the human body is not a machine.

The human body is not a machine, so just because I ate 100 kcal...

It's not that you perfectly absorb 100 kcal.

If you consume too many calories, the excess calories will be excreted as waste.

The reason we can use the poop we initially made as fertilizer is that, right?

The calories that are not absorbed by the body remain in the feces.

If you use this as fertilizer, the remaining calories will be absorbed by the crops, helping them grow well.

This content was explained in detail in the video titled "The Reason Why Starvation Diets Are Unfair."

I will put the link in the top right now.

If you are curious about content that contradicts the calorie theory,

I recommend watching that video.

What is the second condition?

Foods that are prohibited other than those allowed in the diet are

It means that if it is not continuous, it is okay to eat.

Many people will probably be incredulous upon hearing this.

Most diets do not allow the consumption of prohibited foods.

Strict diets treat forbidden foods as if they were poison.

This is poison and a shortcut to ruin my body, and it talks as if I would die immediately if I consume it.

Some people say, "Why would you put garbage into your body?"

They harshly criticize those who couldn't hold back and ate.

Loser, weak-willed, don't you have that much grit, garbage, and so on. They say a lot of things.

The important thing is that we went to a place like a drinking party, so we drank alcohol and ate snacks.

But just because I did this for a day, my weight isn't going to increase by 10kg or 20kg, right?

I have been continuously eating this, which is why I have gained weight.

Just because you ate for one day doesn't mean it will be like that.

And as mentioned earlier, if you follow a diet that meets the first condition,

My body is gradually returning to normal metabolism. In that process, the obesity is disappearing.

Then, after my body returned to normal metabolism, I ate forbidden foods.

Eating forbidden foods doesn't immediately ruin your body.

At first, you get a bit of a shock, like "Huh? What is this?"

If this continues, your body's metabolism will gradually break down.

And if you go beyond the limit, it leads to obesity.

However, if it's not continuous, it means that my body can handle eating it occasionally.

My metabolism is that strong.

The reason for having to eat the food from the first condition is

It's to restore my body to that level of strength, back to its original state.

If you strictly follow the diet, you will go through a process that changes your body and helps you lose weight.

However, the moment you take even a single bite of the forbidden food, that statement falls apart.

It will take 2 to 3 weeks to reverse this, and in the meantime, you will gain weight like crazy.

There is a diet that instills fear in this way.

If that's the case, don't follow that kind of diet.

This is saying that the yo-yo is coming back.

Our diet is one that easily leads to yo-yo dieting.

Why follow a diet that easily leads to yo-yo dieting? It's better not to follow that kind of diet.

The important thing is that my body finds its original metabolism.

Being able to refuse junk food even when it's offered.

It's best not to eat it in the first place.

The best thing is not to eat, but that's impossible in modern society.

Most of the food is made from grains, and I can't avoid going to drinking gatherings.

When you travel, you have to try the local food, and when it comes to the World Cup, you should enjoy some chicken and beer.

How can a person live their whole life without doing something like this?

In my view, that's impossible.

Saying not to eat such things because it's impossible is just an idealistic notion.

Then let's make a realistic compromise.

What should I do to maintain my diet while eating this?

You just need to avoid eating continuously.

Eat without holding back, but let's not continue eating this for several days.

This is the level of compromise we are suggesting.

The two conditions mentioned earlier.

You can eat meat, vegetables, and fruits without any restrictions on the types or amounts, but...

Listen to the signals your body is giving you and adjust your diet accordingly.

It is best not to eat such food in the second place, but...

Forcing myself to endure stress leads me to quit my diet altogether or

It's not good for the body's metabolism to be disrupted because of stress hormones.

If there is food you want to eat, consume it in moderation.

Then your body will gradually improve and you will lose weight.

This is the Longo diet.
