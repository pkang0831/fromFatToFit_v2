There is a saying that ramen is not a fattening food... Is it true? - Ramen Part 1

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

A serving of ramen has 500 kcal, which is not too high in calories.

Looking at the nutritional components of ramen, there are no issues with the nutritional balance.

I watched a video that said ramen is not a fattening food.

Is this really true?

A question with this content was posted in the comments.

Let's talk in detail.

First, I will organize the content of the comments.

The appropriate ratio of energy intake according to the 2015 Korean nutrient intake standards is as follows.

Carbohydrates are recommended to make up 55-65% of total energy, proteins 7-20%, and fats 15-30%.

On average, it would be about 60% carbohydrates, 15% protein, and 25% fat.

The estimated average daily energy requirement for adult men and women aged 19 to 29 is

A man needs 2600 kcal per day, while a woman needs 2100 kcal per day.

If we apply the nutrient ratio that was mentioned earlier to this calorie count,

A man should consume 1560 kcal, which is 60% of 2600 kcal, from carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates provide 4 kcal per gram, so it amounts to 390g.

If we base it on three meals a day, the amount of carbohydrates you should eat per meal is 130g.

If you calculate protein and fat in the same way,

The results show that one should consume 33g of protein and 24g of fat per meal.

If we calculate for the case of a woman,

You need to consume 105g of carbohydrates, 26g of protein, and 19g of fat in one meal.

However, looking at the nutritional components of ramen, it contains 80g of carbohydrates, 10g of protein, and 16g of fat.

When ramen is eaten as a meal, regardless of gender, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are all insufficient.

It doesn't make sense to say that eating ramen makes you gain weight when you are lacking carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

Rather, you need to eat additional foods to make up for the lack of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

Therefore, ramen is not a fattening food, and it is not a problem to eat ramen while on a diet.

This is what the person who wrote the comment claims to have seen in the video.

Is the calculation presented here correct?

If the calculations are correct, does eating ramen not lead to weight gain?

If eating ramen doesn't make you gain weight, then why is there a perception that ramen is a fattening food?

You asked about something like this.

First of all, there is no error in the calculation itself.

The issue is the ratio of nutrients that we are using as a standard.

With the advent of agriculture, rice became a staple in the East, while wheat became a staple in the West.

However, before the advent of agriculture, grains were not the staple food.

The main foods were meat obtained from hunting, and vegetables and fruits gathered from foraging.

Grains have a high carbohydrate content.

Eating more than 100g of carbohydrates in one meal is not that difficult.

In fact, a bowl of rice weighing 200g contains about 70g of carbohydrates.

However, if we exclude grains, the story changes completely.

Leafy vegetables contain an average of about 4g of carbohydrates per 100g.

Fruits contain an average of about 10g of carbohydrates per 100g.

Root vegetables like potatoes and sweet potatoes contain an average of about 20g of carbohydrates per 100g.

If you eat 100g each of leafy vegetables, fruits, and root vegetables, totaling 300g, you will consume a total of 34g of carbohydrates.

10-15% of this carbohydrate is indigestible dietary fiber.

The actual carbohydrates consumed, excluding dietary fiber, amount to about 30g.

So, when you eat a balanced 300g of vegetables and fruits, the carbohydrates you get amount to 30g.

To obtain 100g of carbohydrates in one meal, you need to eat approximately 1kg of vegetables and fruits.

Based on three meals a day, the amount you need to eat in a day is 3 kg.

This is the amount calculated based only on carbohydrates.

Considering that you need to eat other foods to obtain protein and fat,

It's simply not an amount that can be eaten in a day.

So, in order to consume more than 2000 kcal a day and get 60% of that from carbohydrates,

It becomes a story that one must eat grains.

If this ratio of nutrient intake is deemed suitable for humans,

It means that humans must eat grains.

But is it necessary for humans to eat grains?

That's not the case.

Before agriculture began, the main diet consisted of meat obtained from hunting and vegetables and fruits gathered from foraging.

If we look at the history of humanity,

The emergence of primates classified as human ancestors dates back millions of years.

The emergence of Homo sapiens, classified as modern humans, occurred hundreds of thousands of years ago.

However, agriculture began about 10,000 years ago.

So humanity has been over the course of tens or hundreds of millions of years.

Humans have evolved to be able to live on the small amounts of carbohydrates obtained from vegetables and fruits.

With the beginning of agriculture, people suddenly started consuming a lot of carbohydrates.

With all those carbohydrates, various side effects are occurring.

One of the side effects is obesity.

In reality, when you consume a lot of carbohydrates, a hormone called insulin is released in large amounts.

One of the functions of insulin is to increase body fat.

A lot of carbohydrates lead to a lot of insulin being released.

It's because of all that insulin that body fat increases, leading to obesity.

Then let's think about it from the opposite perspective.

If many carbohydrates increase body fat and make us obese,

If you reduce the amount of carbohydrates you eat, will body fat decrease and lead to weight loss?

It actually works for dieting.

If you reduce the amount of carbohydrates you consume, the secretion of insulin will decrease.

When the insulin that stores body fat decreases,

The glucagon hormone that burns body fat increases.

This will actually lead to a reduction in body fat.

So, the problem is eating too many carbohydrates?

But why is the ratio of nutrient intake set so high for carbohydrates at 60%?

With the beginning of agriculture 10,000 years ago, the staple food changed to grains.

We now take a diet based on grains as a given.

In a situation where it is taken for granted to eat grains, the ratio of nutrient intake is determined.

It is inevitable that carbohydrates will be set high.

However, this itself could be a problem.

Let's remember what we've discussed so far and talk about ramen again.

When looking at the standard of 60% carbohydrates,

Ramen is a food that is high in carbohydrates and has a good nutritional ratio.

Therefore, eating ramen does not necessarily lead to weight gain.

Is this correct?

Alternatively, we know from experience that eating ramen makes us gain weight.

Is it strange to have a standard that recommends nutritional components (ratios) similar to that ramen?

I will summarize.

A lot of carbohydrates trigger the secretion of a lot of insulin.

Excess insulin increases body fat, making us obese.

Looking at the nutritional components of ramen, the proportion of carbohydrates is seriously high.

So after eating ramen, a lot of insulin was released.

This can lead to an increase in body fat and result in obesity.

However, eating just one bowl of ramen doesn't immediately make you gain weight, right?

Yes, that's right.

However, no food in this world will make you obese just by eating it once.

Snacks, ice cream, cake, and even fried foods do not make you obese after just one time eating them.

The food I ate seems to affect my body by causing a lot of insulin hormone to be released.

Since the body is affected, eating habits change.

As eating habits change, body fat gradually increases, leading to obesity.

On the contrary, just eating diet food once doesn't mean you'll lose weight immediately.

The food I eat changes my body.

My changed body has led to changes in my eating habits.

When eating habits change, weight loss occurs.

It's not that nutritional content or calories are meaningless, but...

It means that if you focus too much on that, errors can occur.

You need to understand the overall concept to avoid falling into errors.

I understand that focusing too much on nutritional content or calories can lead to mistakes.

So... what kind of food is good for dieting?

You can eat unrefined foods.

I explained in detail what unrefined food is in another video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have a video that explains unrefined foods in detail appear in the top left.

If you're curious, you can click to see it.

If you really want to eat ramen while on a diet, what do you think you should do?

Reduce the sodium content by using only half the amount of soup.

I've heard a lot of people say to rinse the ramen in water once to remove the grease before eating it...

First of all, just eating one bowl of ramen doesn't mean you'll gain weight immediately.

If you really want to eat ramen, you can go ahead and eat it.

However, if you only add half of the soup base, the ramen becomes bland, resulting in lower satisfaction.

I ate ramen, but since my craving wasn't satisfied, I might want to eat more.

And in the first place, ramen has about 500 calories per serving, which isn't that high in calories.

The issue is not the calories, but rather that there are too many carbohydrates.

Washing off the grease to lower calories is not very effective.

Instead, add only half the noodles and include other ingredients to reduce the amount of carbohydrates consumed.

It is more effective to eat vegetables that help with sodium excretion together.

I previously made a video about how to eat ramen without gaining weight, as there was a question about it.

I will make sure the video appears in the top right corner.

If you're curious about this part, you can click here to see it.

You said that eating too many carbohydrates makes you gain weight.

Looking at this photo, our ancestors ate a lot of rice but were very slim, right?

This question has come up before, so I made a video explaining in detail why that is.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom left.
