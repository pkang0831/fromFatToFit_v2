Reasons why women fall into strange diets.

Hello, this is pkang.

There are various diet methods in the world, some of which are quite strange.

However, there is a perception that strange diets are particularly common among women.

Why is there this perception?

There are various reasons, but the most representative cause is the menstrual cycle.

There was a question in the comments asking for information about dieting based on the menstrual cycle.

I created a series of videos under the name "Menstrual Diet."

It seems that the content from that series could be the answer.

If you are curious about the detailed content of the video,

The playlist link is available at the top right, so you can click on it to view.

To briefly summarize the content related to this video in the series,

A woman's menstrual cycle consists of the ovulation period, the week before menstruation, the menstruation period, and the week after menstruation.

It can be categorized into four stages like this.

When an egg is released during ovulation, the body begins to prepare for pregnancy.

Blood vessels expand in the endometrium, and secretory glands develop.

When successful in becoming pregnant, the body stores nutrients and water.

Because of this, even if you don't do anything, your weight tends to increase during the ovulation period and the week before your period.

The phrase famous for being the biggest lie about dieting is "You can gain weight just by drinking water."

Women during this period really gain weight just by drinking water.

It's a situation where my weight has increased, but my body fat has not increased.

It's not entirely accurate to say that I've gained weight, but...

Due to the increasing body water, the body swells and weight increases.

It's a situation that can easily lead to misunderstandings.

The increased weight and body water will be lost during the week following menstruation.

If the period of ovulation and the week before menstruation is a time when just drinking water causes weight gain,

The week before and the week after your period is a time when you can lose weight even without doing anything.

However, during menstruation, the stress is so high that it's difficult to manage my diet.

So, the week after menstruation is often referred to as a woman's golden period for dieting.

So does that mean a woman will definitely gain weight for two weeks and lose weight for two weeks every month?

No, that's not the case.

Even if it is a period when weight increases due to the menstrual cycle,

If the weight lost through dieting is greater, then it is possible to lose weight.

Even if it is a period when weight decreases due to the menstrual cycle,

If the weight gain is more due to other factors, then weight can increase.

The problem is misunderstanding the effects of dieting due to the menstrual cycle.

For example, during the ovulation period and the week before menstruation, just drinking water can cause weight gain.

Even if you are on the right diet and your body fat has decreased,

Weight may not decrease well or may even increase.

There is an increase in weight due to the menstrual cycle.

However, if you are unaware that your weight can change due to your menstrual cycle,

Because my weight is not decreasing well or has even increased, I start to question that diet method.

I think the dieting method is completely wrong or

At the very least, I think it doesn't fit my body.

On the contrary, during the week of menstruation and the week after menstruation,

Even if you are on a strange diet and your body fat doesn't decrease at all, your weight can still go down.

There is weight loss that occurs with the menstrual cycle.

If you are unaware that your weight is decreasing due to your menstrual cycle at this time,

There can be a misconception that strange diets are effective.

So when I saw a strange diet,

The man knows that the diet is strange, but the woman does not.

This is not it.

I know that it's strange for a woman too.

However, since men do not have a menstrual cycle, any ineffective diet method is guaranteed to be ineffective.

If a woman diets during the period when her weight decreases due to her menstrual cycle,

Weight loss during the menstrual cycle can be misunderstood as the effect of a strange diet.

I definitely thought this diet wouldn't work, but after actually trying it, I found that I lost weight.

So, is this correct?

This thought comes to mind.

I will summarize.

Women experience weight fluctuations according to their menstrual cycle.

If you only focus on daily weight changes without considering this change,

Misunderstanding that a proper diet is ineffective or

You might misunderstand that a strange diet is effective.

Aside from misunderstandings about dieting methods, many other misconceptions can arise as well.

For example, I started exercising to lose weight, but...

When my weight increases due to my menstrual cycle, it’s tough because I’ve been working hard to exercise, but instead, my weight goes up.

"I guess exercise just doesn't suit me," and so I even quit exercising altogether.

If you think of the weight gained during your menstrual cycle as muscle weight,

"I have a body type that easily builds muscle." This is a misunderstanding that some people have.

I started my diet during the period when my weight decreases due to my menstrual cycle, and I have been seeing significant results.

When the weight increases during the menstrual cycle and the effects of dieting weaken,

After starting a diet, some people misunderstand that they have hit a plateau after just two weeks.

You might think it's strange to have such misunderstandings, but...

People tend to place more value on what they have seen and experienced themselves.

It is not unusual to misunderstand things when you are not familiar with the menstrual cycle.

However, misunderstandings like this can lead to problems.

It is advisable to consider the menstrual cycle.

So, does that mean a woman can only diet for half of the month?

It is possible to reduce body fat through dieting even during the ovulation period and the week before menstruation.

It's difficult to confirm that because the weight gain is simply due to the menstrual cycle.

So the comparison of women's weight and body shape is

It is advisable to compare the week after last month's period with the week after this month's period.
