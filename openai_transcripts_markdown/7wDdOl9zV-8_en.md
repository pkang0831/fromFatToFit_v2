Two Sure Ways to Lose Belly Fat - Part 1 on Losing Belly Fat

I see many comments expressing concerns about belly fat.

In this video, I would like to talk about how to lose belly fat.

There are sayings that belly fat is the first to go and also that it is the last to go.

Which side is correct?

Both statements are correct.

What we need to lose in a diet is body fat.

There are two types of body fat.

It's the visceral fat next to the internal organs and the subcutaneous fat just beneath the skin.

The skin covers the entire body, but the only place where the internal organs are located is the abdomen.

So, the body fat on the thighs or arms refers to subcutaneous fat.

You can think of body fat as referring to both visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

So if you want to lose belly fat, you need to reduce both visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is located right next to the organs, making it easy to convert into energy.

So if you follow the right diet, it is body fat that is easier to lose rather than subcutaneous fat.

When you start a diet, your stomach is the first to slim down. The fat around your stomach is the first to go.

This story is about the visceral fat in the body.

It means that the visceral fat in the abdomen decreases faster than subcutaneous fat in other areas.

On the other hand, the statement that the belly is the last place to lose fat refers to subcutaneous fat.

I talked about it in the subcutaneous fat series.

Subcutaneous fat is located very far from the internal organs, making it difficult to utilize as energy.

So I need to lose weight through exercise.

The abdominal muscles, being small in size, have the characteristic of getting tired easily.

The subcutaneous fat on the belly is harder to lose than subcutaneous fat in other areas.

This means that belly fat is the last to go.

So, the belly is an area that has both visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

It's the area where body fat increases the most when you gain weight.

When you start a diet, the visceral fat decreases first, and your belly is the first to slim down.

However, even if visceral fat decreases, subcutaneous fat remains.

The belly is the first place where dieting begins, but it is not the first place where dieting ends.

In fact, the subcutaneous fat in the abdomen is harder to lose than subcutaneous fat in other areas.

In most cases, the subcutaneous fat on the belly tends to remain until the end.

The belly is the first place where the effects of dieting become noticeable, but...

It is the last area where weight loss occurs.

Returning to the original story.

So, what is the most efficient way to lose belly fat?

There are two methods, and combining them is the most effective.

The first method is a diet that reduces visceral fat.

There are so many types of diet plans that I don't know which one to follow.

What diet is the best?

There are a wide variety of diet plans.

The basic principle of dieting is one.

As additional conditions are added on top of that basic principle, the diet becomes more varied.

I don't know about other conditions, but for those who just want to lose belly fat,

You just need to stick to the basic principles.

Regarding the basic principles of dieting,

In the video about distinguishing between fattening foods and weight-loss foods, we discussed it in detail.

If you refer to that video and avoid foods that make you gain weight, and instead create a diet with foods that help you lose weight, then you will...

Losing visceral fat is not very difficult.

The second is exercise that reduces body fat.

What type of exercise is most effective?

Let's talk about it in terms of belly fat.

It is best to combine running, abdominal exercises, and knee exercises.

Why is running effective for losing belly fat?

I talked about effective exercises for reducing body fat in the video.

The most effective exercise for reducing body fat is not necessarily high-calorie-burning workouts.

You mentioned that it is a high-activity exercise.

Among the exercises with high activity levels, running is the one that can be done with the least burden.

It is said that people who weigh a lot should be careful with running as it can be bad for their knees.

Yes, that's right.

In such cases, you can gradually increase the intensity in intervals.

Start by walking at first and try to walk for an hour without taking a break.

Once you get used to it, you can alternate between walking for 1 minute and brisk walking for 1 minute for a total of 1 hour.

Once you become more accustomed to this, please increase the time for fast walking to 2 minutes, while walking for 1 minute.

If you keep extending this time, you'll be able to walk quickly for an hour continuously.

After that, you can alternate between brisk walking and running in intervals.

If you keep doing this consistently, you will get used to running and your weight will gradually decrease.

At some point, you can run for an hour with almost no strain on your knees.

In this case, you can alternate between sprinting and jogging as an interval.

For a person who weighs a lot, exercising can be harmful to the joints.

That's correct.

However, being overweight is not good for the joints itself.

So, please don't avoid exercising at all costs.

You can start with easy exercises that are not too demanding and gradually increase the intensity.

If you try to run without any plan from the beginning, problems will arise.

However, I've heard that doing abdominal exercises doesn't actually lead to losing belly fat.

Why should we do abdominal exercises?

I mentioned it in the video about spot reduction for weight loss.

The reason why doing abdominal exercises doesn't necessarily reduce belly fat is that

When you take about an hour to exercise.

This is because full-body exercises like running are more effective than doing abdominal workouts.

However, in the case of knitting exercises that are done all day long without any time limit,

Since exercising by body part is quite effective,

If you want to quickly reduce belly fat, engage in full-body exercises like running when you work out.

It is good to continue doing knit exercises for your abs during the other times.

If your abdominal muscles are weak, it will be difficult to maintain a knit exercise for a long time.

So, by doing abdominal exercises, you can strengthen your core muscles.

You can think of it as using that strength to do knit exercises for a long time to lose weight.

I will summarize.

To lose belly fat, you need to reduce both visceral fat and subcutaneous fat in the abdomen.

Reducing visceral fat is effective with diet.

Exercising is effective for reducing body fat.

It is most effective to combine running, abdominal exercises, and knee exercises.
