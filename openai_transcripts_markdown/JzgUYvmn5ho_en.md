The topic of this video is about a natural plant-based diet.

I have a video I made earlier about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In this video, a theory is presented regarding the causes of increased body fat.

To solve that, you need to reduce your carbohydrate intake.

In that case, I mentioned that it would naturally lead to a low-carb, high-fat diet.

I saw a comment below about a diet called "natural plant-based diet."

This is called a high-carb, low-fat diet.

It's a diet that is the complete opposite of a low-carb, high-fat diet.

"There are people who have lost a lot of weight with this diet. 'Who are these people?'"

If two diets present completely opposite theories and both claim that they lead to weight loss,

You asked the question of what we should believe.

To get straight to the point,

The two diets may seem completely opposite at first glance, but

The reasons for an increase in body fat and how to lose body fat are based on the same theory.

The underlying theory is the same, but the branches that grow on top are a bit different.

I will explain which parts are the same.

Although this content has been repeated several times in other videos, there are also people who are watching my video for the first time.

I will briefly touch on the causes of increased body fat leading to obesity.

When carbohydrates are consumed, they are converted into glucose in the body and used as an energy source.

This glucose spreads throughout the body via the bloodstream.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is called blood sugar.

When blood sugar levels rise above a certain point, inflammation occurs in the blood vessel walls.

Then, inflammation can cause blood vessels to become blocked.

Because there can be holes in the blood vessel walls.

The body will naturally try to lower blood sugar levels.

The hormone that plays this role is called insulin.

What insulin does when it is secreted is...

It converts glucose in the blood into fat and stores it in fat cells.

The fat stored in this way is body fat.

As much as it is stored as body fat, the concentration of glucose in the blood decreases.

The issue of inflammation in the blood vessel walls has been resolved.

However, if this process continues to repeat, body fat will gradually increase.

As a result, it leads to obesity. This is the basic process.

So, it means that we need to reduce carbohydrate intake.

The important part in this process is...

Foods that are mostly made up of carbohydrates are called carbohydrate foods.

It's important to note that not all carbohydrate foods raise blood sugar levels in the same way.

There are foods that significantly raise blood sugar levels and foods that slightly raise blood sugar levels.

Even if you eat the same amount, there can be such differences.

So, you may have noticed that the term GI index comes up when talking about diets.

It is an index that indicates how much blood sugar has increased 30 minutes after eating a certain food.

The GI index is not perfect; it has its own errors.

The GL index has come up, and we need to combine these two things to have a good discussion about blood sugar.

What I want to say in this video is that it can also be explained by the GI index.

I won't go into explaining the GL index in detail. Doing so would make the content a bit more complicated.

Anyway, the GI index is important.

Foods that slightly increase blood sugar if the GI index is 50 or lower.

If it is 70 or above, it is classified as a food that significantly increases blood sugar levels.

Then, we looked into the GI index of the two foods that are commonly known to be reduced in diets: white rice and sugar.

There are differences in the GI index reported by various institutions, but on average, white rice has a GI of 90, and sugar has a GI of 100.

They said that anything above 70 is considered high.

If rice is 90 and salt is 100, then it's 20 and 30 higher, right? That's incredibly high.

So, blood sugar levels spike rapidly, which leads to obesity.

However, an important point is that grains have the characteristic of rapidly raising blood sugar levels.

However, in modern society, grains are the staple food.

In the East, rice made into cooked rice.

In the West, there is bread made from wheat.

Since this becomes a stock, the increase in blood sugar due to these grain carbohydrates is too severe.

That is causing the obesity population to increase.

It's about saying not to eat things like this.

However, just because you don't eat these things, you can't completely avoid carbohydrates, right?

Carbohydrates are essential nutrients for our body, and we must consume a certain amount every day without fail.

If you're going to eat anyway, choose something other than carbohydrates that quickly raise blood sugar.

It means to eat carbohydrates that slightly increase blood sugar.

What that is, is a vegetable.

Most of the calories are made up of carbohydrates, but they are foods that increase blood sugar slightly and slowly.

So when talking about a low-carb, high-fat diet, it's important to keep emphasizing that you should continue to eat vegetables.

The content up to this point is about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

The fundamental theory behind the causes of increased body fat and the reasons for eating vegetables is as follows.

It can also be applied directly to a natural plant-based diet.

Finally, we have arrived at natural plant-based food.

In a natural plant-based diet, it is referred to as a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet.

Foods classified as prohibited in a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Are rice, flour, and sugar consumption allowed? If you look it up,

This diet also does not allow this food.

Both the natural plant-based diet or high-carb low-fat diet and the low-carb high-fat diet.

The carbohydrates that rapidly increase blood sugar lead to the accumulation of body fat.

This is the part that both diets share in common regarding the causes of obesity.

So don't eat this.

The common theory of both diets is to eat foods that slowly increase blood sugar levels.

Regardless of which diet you follow, it's natural for your weight to decrease.

Regarding the causes of body fat accumulation and obesity, there is a shared common theory, and efforts are being made to eliminate it.

So, where do the differences lie?

Foods that rapidly increase blood sugar have been our staple, right?

In the East, rice is made into meals, while in the West, bread is made from wheat.

"Let's not eat this anymore, let's cut back," and then the question arises, "So what are we going to eat?"

What is the theory of a natural plant-based diet?

It is best to eat food in its natural state.

I believe that cooking food is not a good action.

So whether it's steaming, grilling, or boiling, if it’s not stir-fried, meat that cannot be eaten is not suitable for humans.

So, the idea of a natural plant-based diet is to eat fruits and vegetables that can be consumed in their natural state instead of eating meat.

Most of the calories in vegetables and fruits come from carbohydrates, and they contain no fat.

So if you eat like this, you'll mostly be consuming carbohydrates.

So that's how it becomes a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet.

The theory behind a low-carb, high-fat diet is that...

Our ancestors have engaged in hunting and gathering activities since ancient times.

So I have been eating a balanced diet of meat, vegetables, and fruits.

Since the discovery of fire, most food has been cooked before eating.

Cooking food  
Eating meat does not cause health problems.

Therefore, it is best to eat a balanced diet of meat, vegetables, and fruits.

Fat provides more than twice the calories compared to carbohydrates and proteins.

Even if you eat the same amount, the calories obtained from fat are greater than those obtained from carbohydrates.

So it becomes a low-carb, high-fat diet.

There is a difference in opinion regarding whether eating meat is good for the body or not. Some believe that eating meat is not good for health, while others think it is okay to eat meat.

Regarding weight loss, the two diets share the same theory.

Regardless of the diet you follow, you can expect weight loss to occur.
