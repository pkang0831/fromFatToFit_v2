If you don't get enough sleep, you can gain weight even without eating - Sleep Diet Part 2.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitle feature.

This is the second video about sleep and dieting.

In the first video, we talked about the reasons why not getting enough sleep makes you crave unhealthy foods.

In this video, we will discuss what happens when you don't get enough sleep.

Let's find out why insulin is released even when food is not consumed.

To put it simply, it's due to stress.

There are a wide variety of situations in which modern humanity experiences stress.

In the past, situations that caused stress for humanity were mostly life-threatening situations.

The ways to cope with such situations can be divided into fight or flight.

Struggle is about fighting against and overcoming threats to life.

Escape is quickly fleeing from a life-threatening situation.

At this time, our bodies change their state to be favorable for fight or flight.

This is called the fight-or-flight response.

By increasing the amount of glucose in the blood, secure the energy needed for fight or flight.

By breathing quickly, secure the oxygen needed for fight or flight.

The heart beats quickly to rapidly send the energy and oxygen secured in this way throughout the entire body.

When you experience stress, your blood sugar levels rise, your breathing becomes rapid, and your heart beats faster.

In the last video, I mentioned that sleeping is an act of resting.

Not sleeping means not resting.

From the body's perspective, it is perceived as a situation where there is some urgent task that must be done without rest.

In such a situation, you need to enhance your physical abilities to quickly resolve the situation.

So if you don't get enough sleep, your body becomes stressed.

Stress leads to the fight-or-flight response.

As mentioned earlier, when a fight-or-flight response occurs, blood sugar levels increase.

If this is a real crisis situation right now,

So if you have to choose between fighting or fleeing, the glucose in your blood will be used for energy.

The problem is that the situation where I can't sleep right now is not an actual crisis.

Since it is not a crisis situation, glucose in the blood is not used as energy.

Since glucose is not used for energy, blood sugar does not decrease.

In that case, insulin needs to be secreted to lower the blood sugar.

Because of this, I don't eat anything.

Just not being able to sleep properly can lead to insulin secretion.

And as I have mentioned in other videos,

Insulin increases body fat and enhances appetite.

Just the secretion of insulin alone can lead to an increase in body fat and weight gain.

If you eat late-night snacks due to increased appetite, you will likely gain more weight.

I understand that eating late-night snacks can lead to weight gain.

Does eating late-night snacks cause weight gain even if insulin is released?

The glucose that is currently raising my blood sugar is originally the glucose that was stored in my body.

What was stored in the body came out and was stored again.

Is it possible for body fat to increase with that?

Yes, it is possible.

The source of the increased glucose due to stress is mostly glycogen and muscle.

Glycogen is a form of carbohydrate stored in the body.

Glycogen was converted into glucose, which then became body fat due to insulin.

Muscle was broken down into glucose, which then turned into body fat due to insulin.

It was originally all in my body, but the composition of the body is changing.

Even at the same weight, a person with more muscle and less body fat looks slim.

On the contrary, a person with low muscle mass and high body fat is considered obese.

Even if the weight is considered underweight, that is, even if it is a low weight.

Having a lot of body fat is considered obesity, and this is referred to as "skinny fat."

So in the end, it is important to consider the composition ratio of the human body.

The most ideal diet is one that reduces body fat while increasing muscle mass.

When you can't sleep and your body becomes stressed, the opposite happens.

That's why it's said to be not good for dieting.

When talking about sleep and dieting, it's usually said that one should sleep around 7 to 8 hours.

I sleep enough for about 10 hours.

There are symptoms shown in the video. Why is that happening to me?

It is because the quality of sleep is low.

Deep sleep refers to getting enough quality sleep.

If there isn't enough time for deep sleep, fatigue won't be relieved.

Even though I have enough time to sleep, I can't fully rest, and the fatigue doesn't go away.

It's not the act of sleeping that is important, but rather...

It is important whether you recover your body and relieve fatigue by sleeping.

What should I do to get a good night's sleep?

If you are experiencing severe insomnia, it is advisable to visit a hospital for consultation.

In cases where that is not true, a few tips may be helpful.

In the following video, I will share some tips that can help you achieve a good night's sleep.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the sleep diet video,

I am still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
