This is the third video in the series about glutinous rice.

In the first video, we explored the reasons behind the conflicting claims about whether brown rice is good or bad for dieting.

In the second video, we explored the reasons behind the opposing claims that brown rice is good for health and that it is bad for health.

The video link is available in the top right corner, so if you're curious, you can click on it to watch.

In this video, I will talk about how to eat brown rice.

The disadvantages of brown rice were mentioned in the previous video as well.

The main disadvantage that is often mentioned is that the husk of brown rice and phytic acid prevent proper digestion and absorption.

As this issue was raised, a counterargument was made regarding it.

"The way to eat brown rice is wrong."

"It was mentioned that if you eat in the right way, digestion and absorption will be proper."

The main way to come out is...

Chew the brown rice more than 50 times before swallowing.

There is a way to eat sprouted brown rice.

Let's talk about how to chew it.

If you chew brown rice at least 50 times every time you take a bite,

The brown rice's husk is finely crushed, and as it mixes with saliva for a long time, it becomes a form that is easily digested and absorbed.

How to eat sprouted brown rice...

If you soak glutinous rice in water for 12 to 24 hours,

The sprouting of brown rice begins to take place.

The reason there are nutrients in brown rice.

When it germinates and becomes a plant, it has stored the nutrients necessary for growth.

So when germination begins, the husk of brown rice becomes softer and the nutrients change into a form that is easily digestible.

Phytic acid, which prevents the absorption of nutrients, is also reduced.

So, by using these two methods,

The issue that was pointed out as a disadvantage of brown rice, namely that it is not digested or absorbed, can be resolved.

However, if your purpose for eating brown rice is for dieting, you should not use this method.

The first video in the Hyunmi series is about whether brown rice is good or bad for dieting.

I mentioned in this video that brown rice has its husk, right?

The reason why white rice is not good for dieting while brown rice is considered good for dieting is…

Brown rice contains husk and phytic acid, which is why it is not digested or absorbed.

Even if you eat the same amount, brown rice is absorbed in smaller quantities by the body compared to white rice.

Even if you eat the same amount, your weight does not increase. Therefore, the basic theory is that it helps with dieting.

However, if you chew it for a long time or eat sprouted brown rice, it becomes a form that is easier to digest and absorb.

When brown rice, which is difficult to digest and absorb, is processed by machines to remove the husk, it becomes white rice, which is easier to digest and absorb.

Long chewing is the process of breaking down brown rice, which is difficult to digest and absorb, into smaller pieces with my teeth, removing the outer skin and making it easier to digest and absorb.

Through germination, the outer shell is removed, making it easier to digest and absorb, which is what sprouted brown rice is.

Essentially, long chewing and sprouted brown rice are consumed in a form that allows for the absorption of the nutrients in brown rice.

It is not helpful for dieting.

These two are essentially not much different from white rice.

It has a lot of good nutrients, but in terms of dieting, it's not really that different.

So if the purpose of eating brown rice is for dieting, you should avoid consuming it in these two ways.

This is because it eliminates the fundamental causes of dieting.

There are people who eat brown rice not for the purpose of dieting.

Many people eat brown rice as a healthy food because it contains a lot of good nutrients for health.

In this case, we will encounter the content from the second video again.

Is brown rice a healthy food? Or a bad food? We talked about this in the video.

The harmful substances found in brown rice are also present in other foods.

It cannot be said that brown rice is particularly bad.

Similarly, the beneficial nutrients found in brown rice are not exclusive to brown rice.

It cannot be said that brown rice is better than other foods.

In summary, brown rice is a type of food.

It is not particularly better or worse than other foods.

So when I ate brown rice, there were no issues with my body.

If you like glutinous rice, you can eat it.

If you like to chew for a long time, you can chew it for a long time before eating.

If you enjoy the unique taste of sprouted brown rice, you can make it with sprouted brown rice and eat it.

It's not that you shouldn't do it that way.

However, I don't really like brown rice.

I don't like to chew for a long time.

It's a hassle to make sprouted brown rice.

Do you have to force yourself for dieting and health? That's not the case.

Sounds plausible, right?
