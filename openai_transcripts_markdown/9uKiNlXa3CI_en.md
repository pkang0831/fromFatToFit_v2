Is it really true that just drinking vinegar can help you lose weight? - Vinegar Part 1

I saw a comment asking for information about the diet effects of vinegar.

In this video, I would like to talk about vinegar.

First, does vinegar have a weight loss effect?

To put it simply, that's correct.

Vinegar contains a component called acetic acid.

Because of this, vinegar has the effect of slowing down digestion.

I mentioned it in the post-meal exercise series as well, but...

When we eat food and our blood sugar levels rise, insulin hormone is secreted.

If you eat foods that rapidly raise your blood sugar levels, an excessive amount of insulin will be secreted.

Excessively secreted insulin increases body fat and makes us gain weight.

It increases appetite, making you want to eat more food more often.

How much does blood sugar increase?

This depends on how much food you eat.

How quickly does blood sugar rise?

This will vary depending on the digestion speed.

Eating foods that are quickly digested causes blood sugar levels to rise rapidly.

If blood sugar rises quickly, insulin needs to be secreted urgently.

When we try to rush to do something, it often leads to waste.

When insulin is secreted rapidly, it tends to be released in excess.

This becomes a problem.

So even if the nutritional components are similar, foods that are digested slowly can be helpful for dieting.

In fact, there is almost no difference in nutritional content between brown rice and white rice.

It makes sense that white rice is what you get when you remove the husk from brown rice.

However, white rice without the husk is a food that causes weight gain because it is digested quickly.

Brown rice with its husk is a diet food that helps with weight loss because it digests slowly due to the husk.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video, the acetic acid in vinegar slows down digestion.

Because it slows down digestion.

You can slow down the rate at which blood sugar rises to create a weight loss effect.

There is actually an example of an experiment that was conducted.

Dividing 175 people into 3 groups.

One group does not drink vinegar.

The other two groups were given vinegar in divided doses of 15ml and 30ml per day.

When I compared diet indicators such as visceral fat, body fat, waist circumference, and weight,

In the group that did not consume vinegar, all results showed an increase.

The group that consumed 15ml of vinegar showed a decrease in all results.

The group that consumed 30ml of vinegar showed a greater reduction compared to the group that consumed 15ml.

When I drank vinegar, I lost weight compared to when I didn't drink it.

The group that drank more vinegar lost weight faster than the group that drank less vinegar.

It is possible to interpret that vinegar has a positive effect on dieting.

So, if I drink more than 30ml of vinegar, will I lose more weight?

No, that's not the case.

The weight loss effect of vinegar is not that vinegar itself eliminates body fat.

It slows down digestion, causing blood sugar to rise slowly.

It helps with dieting because it causes blood sugar to rise slowly.

Drinking a lot of vinegar does not indefinitely slow down digestion.

The more vinegar you drink, the less effective it becomes.

Drinking too much vinegar can lead to other issues such as gastritis and gastric ulcers.

The recommended daily intake of vinegar is less than 30ml.

So the more you drink, the less the increase in effectiveness becomes.

Rather, it could lead to other health issues.

It is recommended to consume less than 30ml per day.

If you feel uncomfortable even with less than 30ml, it is better not to consume it.

How much is 30ml?

You can think of it as about 4 tablespoons using a regular spoon from home.

If you eat two meals a day, having about 2 tablespoons during one meal is equivalent to 30ml.

I heard about the vinegar diet from you, and I've been diligently drinking vinegar.

But I didn't see much effect. Why didn't I experience any effect?

This is because several conditions are necessary for the effects of vinegar to manifest.

In the next video, we will explore situations where vinegar is effective and share tips on how to use vinegar.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the vinegar, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making the video.
