Hello, this is pkang.

In this video, when losing weight, the volume of the face, chest, and buttocks decreases.

I will talk about how weight tends to first accumulate in the arms, thighs, and belly.

This phenomenon mostly occurs in women's diets.

As mentioned in the series on subcutaneous fat,

When men accumulate body fat, it primarily builds up as visceral fat.

When women accumulate body fat, it primarily builds up as subcutaneous fat.

So, a woman's diet should focus on methods to reduce subcutaneous fat.

There are overlapping functions between what muscles do and what subcutaneous fat does.

When muscle mass decreases, the amount of subcutaneous fat that takes over the work of the muscles increases.

When muscle mass increases, the amount of subcutaneous fat decreases.

If you want to reduce body fat, building muscle through exercise is effective.

If you are curious about why this is happening,

The playlist link for the subcutaneous fat video is being shared at the top right.

You can click to watch the video.

However, women's diets often focus more on diet rather than exercise.

So, the subcutaneous fat doesn't come off easily.

As a result, there is a strong tendency to choose a low-calorie diet that reduces the amount of food consumed.

In this case, when you lose weight, the volume in your face, chest, and hips decreases first.

When gaining weight, the phenomenon occurs where the arms, thighs, and belly fat are the first to accumulate.

If you follow a low-calorie diet and force yourself to suppress your hunger,

Because the body lacks energy, it increases the absorption rate of food to increase energy intake.

I am trying to lower my body's metabolic rate to reduce energy consumption.

During the process of lowering the body's metabolic rate, muscle loss occurs.

Muscle and subcutaneous fat have overlapping functions.

It was said that when muscle mass decreases, the amount of subcutaneous fat increases.

However, right now I am eating very little food.

I'm in a situation where I'm lacking energy to use right away, so I'm breaking down muscle for fuel.

The increase in subcutaneous fat is not due to a lack of surplus energy being stored as subcutaneous fat.

So, the body fat should be increasing, but it's in a situation where it can't increase due to a lack of energy.

Rather, it is a situation where body fat should be used as energy.

In such a situation, to use subcutaneous fat as energy, it is more important to focus on areas where the need for subcutaneous fat has increased due to muscle loss rather than...

Since I originally didn't have much muscle, the impact of muscle loss is minimal.

It is a priority to use subcutaneous fat from areas where the need for subcutaneous fat has not increased as energy.

The areas corresponding to this are the face and chest.

The face originally has less muscle mass, so the impact of muscle loss due to a low-calorie diet is minimal.

Because the impact of muscle loss is minimal, the necessity for subcutaneous fat does not increase.

Since the necessity for subcutaneous fat is not high, the subcutaneous fat in the face is used as energy.

The second is the chest.

The subcutaneous fat in the chest has slightly different characteristics compared to subcutaneous fat in other areas.

Subcutaneous fat in other areas protects the body from external impacts.

Since it is responsible for maintaining body temperature, there are overlapping functions with the muscles.

The subcutaneous fat in the chest is not accumulated for that purpose.

So when muscle loss occurs, the need for subcutaneous fat in the chest does not increase.

Isn't a woman's breast a very important organ?

If the situation allows for pregnancy and childbirth, it would be very important.

In situations where pregnancy and childbirth are not possible, it is not the case.

In reality, a woman's breasts are not fixed in size.

It repeatedly grows larger and then smaller in accordance with the menstrual cycle.

When you become pregnant and give birth, the size will increase.

If pregnancy and childbirth are possible, the size increases for utilization.

When it is not the case, it can shrink depending on the situation.

A low-calorie diet from the body's perspective occurs in a situation where food is needed but difficult to obtain.

This situation can be considered unsuitable for pregnancy and childbirth.

So, if you follow a low-calorie diet for a long time, your menstrual cycle may become irregular.

Alternatively, there are cases where menstruation does not occur.

In this situation, there is no reason to leave subcutaneous fat on the chest.

What about the butt? Since there are originally a lot of muscles in the butt, if you go low-calorie, you will lose butt muscle.

When muscle loss occurs, the need for subcutaneous fat increases.

Subcutaneous fat in the buttocks should be lost slowly, but when following a low-calorie diet, the volume of the buttocks tends to decrease quickly.

The case of the buttocks is a bit unusual.

The buttocks contain a muscle called the gluteus maximus, which is covered by subcutaneous fat.

This butt is under the influence of gravity, which exerts a downward pulling force.

Subcutaneous fat is soft and lacks firmness, so it tends to sag downward due to gravity.

Muscles are firm and elastic, which allows them to resist gravity.

So when the glute muscles develop and increase in size,

The subcutaneous fat covering the gluteal muscles is pushed back towards the body.

The subcutaneous fat in the buttocks will not sag down but will instead rise up and become rounded at the back.

This is called a hip-up.

Conversely, if the size of the gluteal muscles decreases due to muscle loss,

Since I can't push the subcutaneous fat of the buttocks back, it tends to sag downwards due to the influence of gravity.

So, if the muscle mass in the buttocks decreases due to muscle loss,

Even if there is a lot of subcutaneous fat, the volume of the buttocks will decrease.

Due to the reasons mentioned so far, if you follow a low-calorie diet,

First, the volume of the face, chest, and hips will decrease.

I understand that the fat in the face decreases and the volume of the chest and hips reduces, but...

Why do we tend to gain weight first in our arms, thighs, and belly?

Shouldn't we first apply it to the area where the subcutaneous fat was removed?

In the video, it was mentioned that when muscle mass decreases due to muscle loss, the need for subcutaneous fat increases.

However, I am on a low-calorie diet.

There was a lack of energy to be stored as fat, which is why it couldn't increase.

When you stop a low-calorie diet and start eating again, energy is created that can be stored as fat.

As a result, the necessity for subcutaneous fat increases, leading to the accumulation of subcutaneous fat in the arms, abdomen, and thighs.

The reason for using subcutaneous fat taken from the face and chest in the first place is...

Since it is an area with originally low muscle mass, the necessity for subcutaneous fat has not increased.

So it was okay to reduce the amount of body fat.

So, between areas where it is okay to reduce the amount of subcutaneous fat and areas where the necessity for subcutaneous fat has increased.

Naturally, fat tissue tends to accumulate first in areas where the need has increased.

So when you diet with a low-calorie diet, the volume in your face and breasts and buttocks tends to decrease first.

When gaining weight, the arms, thighs, and belly are the first areas to accumulate fat.

So, it is better to have a sufficient meal and exercise rather than following a low-calorie diet.

Sounds plausible, right?
