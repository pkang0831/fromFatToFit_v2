The reason your New Year's diet fails every time - Calories Part 1

At the beginning of the new year, many people decide to go on a diet.

So I am working hard on my diet and exercise.

Most people give up after a short time.

This time, I made a strong commitment to succeed in my diet.

Why do we end up giving up after a short time?

It is because the information that I thought was obviously correct is actually wrong.

There are really many diet theories in the world.

Among them, the most well-known theory is the calorie diet theory.

The calories obtained from food are greater than the calories consumed by the body.

When you are in a state of excess calories, you gain weight.

Conversely, the calories consumed by the body are greater than the calories obtained from food.

The theory is that when you are in a calorie deficit, you lose weight.

Because the theory is simple, it is not difficult to understand.

It is persuasive and has spread to a lot of people.

Many people take this theory for granted and consider it the truth about dieting.

However, the reason many people give up on dieting is actually because of this theory.

Let's talk about why that is in detail.

According to the calorie diet theory, in order to lose weight, you need to be in a calorie deficit.

There are two methods here.

The first is to reduce the amount of food you eat, thereby decreasing the calories that enter your body.

The second is to start exercising to increase the calories your body burns.

However, if you want to exercise, you need to set aside time for it.

However, for busy modern individuals, this is not an easy task.

So, in the early days when the calorie diet theory was introduced, most people only focused on dieting through their diet.

You can follow a low-calorie diet by composing your meals with low-calorie foods.

Or you could just not eat at all and starve.

However, an unexpected problem arises here.

The body's metabolism decreases.

So, in a state where I was eating 100 units of food and consuming 100 units, I was maintaining balance.

If you reduce the amount of food you eat and only eat 50.

It becomes a shortage when it reaches -50.

I thought I would lose that much weight.

In reality, it is to respond to a state of calorie deficiency.

The energy consumed by the body decreases to 50.

If the energy consumed by the body decreases to 50,

Even if I eat 50 less, I don't lose weight.

Originally, if you ate 100 units, you would maintain your weight, but now you end up gaining weight instead.

So, dieting becomes harder, while gaining weight becomes easier.

This means that if you lose weight by starving yourself, your basal metabolic rate decreases, making it easier for you to gain weight.

So, the human body is originally designed to change according to the situation for survival.

So, when you follow a low-calorie diet, there is a response that lowers the body's metabolic rate.

The calorie diet theory assumes that even if the surrounding circumstances change, the body does not change.

This is the error of the calorie diet theory.

The problem is that people's belief in the calorie diet theory was too strong.

Rather than recognizing that there is an error in the theory, I tried to find other alternatives.

The alternative I found is exercise.

The current problem is that the calories consumed by the body are decreasing.

Exercise has the effect of increasing the calories the body consumes.

So, if you follow a low-calorie diet for weight loss, your body's metabolism will decrease.

It is said that exercising can prevent this metabolic rate from decreasing.

So, just following a diet is not enough. It has been argued that both diet and exercise must be done.

From this point on, a diet that only focuses on food intake is not a proper diet.

The perception that a diet combining meal plans and exercise is the correct way to lose weight is spreading.

I have reduced the amount of food I'm eating, so I feel weak.

It's really difficult to exercise when I'm trying to force myself to do tough workouts while feeling weak.

It's hard to exercise, so I feel like wanting to quit.

If you only focus on diet without exercise, your basal metabolic rate will decrease, which can lead to problems.

If I can't exercise, I start to think that I can't diet.

So many people often give up on dieting altogether.

This is the most common pattern for giving up on dieting.

If you want to break free from the cycle of failing diets every time,

Clearly recognize that there are errors in the calorie diet theory.

You need to abandon the calorie diet theory.

You can lose weight without following a low-calorie diet.

The calories burned through exercise have almost no impact on dieting.

If it's not a low-calorie diet, what kind of diet should I follow?

Don't worry about calories; you can change the types of food you eat.

In the video on how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods, I explained it in detail.

The video link is available in the top right corner.

If you are curious about what kind of diet to follow, you can click here to see.

Is it true that the calories burned through exercise have almost no impact on dieting?

Yes, that's right.

If you reduce the amount of food you eat, you create a calorie deficit environment.

Our bodies reduce the energy they expend in order to adapt to the environment.

Similarly, if you increase the energy expended through exercise to create a calorie deficit environment,

Our bodies respond in order to adapt to the environment.

You try to replenish the calories burned through exercise in other ways.

How to replenish the calories burned through exercise.

I explained in the video why you might not lose weight even if you do exercises that burn a lot of calories.

The link is going out at the top right.

For those who are curious about the details, you can click to see more.

I watched a video about the reasons why I didn't lose weight even though I did a lot of calorie-burning exercises last year.

Honestly, I didn't really believe it.

However, in January of this year, SBS aired a special New Year's diet documentary.

I was surprised to hear a story similar to that of Ronka there.

I understood the overall content, but there is one thing that I don't understand.

The documentary features the Hadza people of Tanzania, who live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

It is said that there is no difference in the daily metabolic rate of modern people who work while sitting.

Does this make sense?

In the next video, we will talk about this.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the calorie part 2 video.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
