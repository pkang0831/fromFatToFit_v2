This video is about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

This is a video about practical implementation methods.

This video continues from the previous one that explained the understanding of a low-carb, high-fat diet.

I will be speaking as if you have seen that video.

For those who haven't seen the video, you can check the description box below this video.

There is a link to a video explaining the low-carb, high-fat diet.

I recommend that you watch that video.

Because if you come without watching that video,

If you watch this video, you'll be thinking, "What kind of low-carb, high-fat diet is that?"

Many people have negative feelings.

Most people will probably do it that way.

If possible, I would appreciate it if you could watch the previous video.

So what I am doing is

It's a diet that simply adheres to the basic concept of low carbohydrates and high fats.

Let's reduce the amount of carbohydrates and slightly increase the intake of fats.

It's a very simple diet.

What you actually do is

When we are on a diet, the biggest concern is lunch, right? Lunch.

Whether I am working or attending school, I mostly buy lunch outside.

What should I do when I am on a diet?

Especially when following a low-carb, high-fat diet, I'm wondering what I should do.

So in my case, what I do is just eat lunch.

I don't really care what kind of lunch it is, I just have a regular lunch.

I eat comfortably without measuring my rice, not even half a bowl or anything like that.

Instead, I stir-fry meat and vegetables for breakfast and dinner.

The essence of a low-carb, high-fat diet is to reduce carbohydrate intake.

It's about slightly increasing the intake of fats.

If we eat all three meals as regular meals,

How much carbohydrates are you consuming?

A typical serving of rice is about 300g, which contains around 70g of carbohydrates.

And when I eat rice, I tend to eat a similar amount of side dishes.

Most side dishes are made with vegetables, right?

Vegetables contain about 5 to 10 grams of carbohydrates per 100 grams. Let's take an average of about 7 grams.

In that case, a serving of 300g of rice contains about 70g of carbohydrates.

The carbohydrates in 300g of vegetables amount to about 21g.

I consume about 90g of carbohydrates in one meal.

If I eat this in three meals, it would be 270g a day, which is too much.

It's the concept of reducing this a bit.

If you eat a regular meal for lunch, you will get 90g of carbohydrates.

In the morning, from 300g of vegetables to stir-fry with meat, I get 21g of carbohydrates.

If you get 21g of carbohydrates from the vegetables you stir-fry with meat for dinner, that's a total of 40g, right?

If you combine it with the regular meal I had for lunch, it totals 130g.

This amount is enough to avoid various side effects that come from eating too few carbohydrates.

One meal is at a regular level.

And since it is about half the level of what we usually do in general practice,

It can be considered that carbohydrates have been sufficiently reduced.

Even with three meals like this, you can still see the effects of a low-carb, high-fat diet.

And while following this diet, there may be occasions where you have plans to go out for drinks.

Or we could have a company gathering at work.

Or there are times when I say, "I feel like I'm going crazy because I want to eat chicken so much" for dinner tonight.

So what you do is just eat it, relax and enjoy.

I intentionally avoid attending drinking gatherings when I'm really stressed, which leads to losing friendships.

You don't have to go out for a company dinner and intentionally avoid drinking even a single glass of alcohol just to eat meat.

Alright, then let me tell you exactly what happens.

I went to a drinking party and ate and drank without worrying too much.

In the case of a light drinking session that ends after the first round, you might find that you weigh about 1 kg more the next day.

If it was a long drinking session that went to the third or fourth round in the evening, I would have gained about 2 kg.

I went on a trip for 2 nights and 3 days and ate like crazy. So I probably gained about 4 kg.

However, there is no need to worry too much about this increase.

Most of the weight gained is water.

What happened here is that a process called carbohydrate loading took place.

This is one of the techniques that was used in the past during marathon competitions, but it is not commonly used now.

Because nowadays, marathon events provide water and energy bars at the mid-point supply stations.

So, it's not done because water and carbohydrates are supplied.

In the past, there were no such things, so you had to just complete the marathon.

I worked on storing glycogen and water in my muscles.

That's carbohydrate loading.

So, I have been following a high-carb diet continuously for 3 to 4 days before the marathon event.

So, if you eat a lot of carbohydrates, it’s natural that your fat will also increase a little.

Some of the excess carbohydrates are converted into glycogen and stored in the muscles in excess.

You might wonder if it's good for glycogen to increase in the muscles.

Hydration is good for the body, but when it accumulates excessively, it can lead to swelling, which is not good for you.

Anything in moderation is good; excess is not beneficial.

Anyway, when you follow a high-carb diet, glycogen gets excessively loaded in the muscles momentarily.

As this glycogen is stored, it doesn't just stay on its own; it retains a certain amount of water.

So the weight that has increased momentarily naturally includes some fat as well.

There can't be no fat.

Because I consumed high carbohydrates, a certain amount would have been converted into fat, resulting in an increase in fat levels.

The majority is water.

So, I guess I have gained about 1 to 4 kg.

From the next day, I will go back to my usual routine of stir-frying meat for breakfast and dinner, and having regular meals for lunch.

If I go back to my original diet, I would be stir-frying and eating meat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

I lose about 1 kg of weight per day.

Sometimes I lose 0.8 kg, and other times I lose 1.5 kg.

This is how the weight drops significantly.

What this means is that there is no additional excess supply of carbohydrates.

The excess glycogen stored in the muscles starts to be released.

And as you lose water that you were holding onto, your weight decreases.

So usually, if it's about 1kg, it takes about 2 days, and even if it's 4kg, it usually returns to the original weight in about 3 to 4 days.

So if I eat this kind of food, my diet is ruined. It's over. It's not that I absolutely shouldn't eat it.

If you eat this kind of food and go to a drinking party,

My diet is just delayed by about 3 to 4 days at most.

Because there was a sudden increase in weight.

It takes about 4 days at most to return to my weight before eating that food.

It's not that eating means the end of a diet failure.

Ah, if I eat this, I think my diet will be delayed by about 3 or 4 days.

Just relax and after returning to your original weight over the next four days,

You can think of it as the beginning of a low-carb, high-fat diet from there.

I hope you don't feel too stressed.

And I found some frequently asked questions about the low-carb, high-fat diet.

The first one is too cheesy.

Some people say that it's hard to eat because it's too rich.

It's because you are too focused on high fat within the low-carb, high-fat diet.

Everyone, the low-carb high-fat diet is

A diet that allows you to eat a lot of fat does not mean that the more you eat, the more weight you will lose.

What you need to focus on importantly is carbohydrates.

I am eating too many carbohydrates. Let's reduce carbohydrate intake.

However, if you simply reduce your carbohydrate intake,

The amount of energy we consume is decreasing.

Then, it will not meet the basal metabolic rate.

The basal metabolic rate decreases, making it easier to gain weight.

So you need to eat at least your basal metabolic rate.

Protein is a material that makes up the body's structure, not a primary energy source.

The idea is to obtain that amount from the local area.

So, it doesn't mean that the more fat you eat, the better it is.

So I stir-fried some meat and it tastes greasy.

Then reduce the amount of oil.

I added butter, but it tastes greasy?

Then you can either add just a little butter or skip the butter altogether.

At first, the pork belly was fine, but as I kept eating, it became too greasy.

Then please grill some other meat instead of pork belly.

You can grill the front leg meat or the hind leg meat.

Alternatively, you can substitute it with a fried egg.

Fat has a rich flavor when it is present in the right amount.

So, if it feels greasy, please don't force yourself to eat it.

You can reduce the amount of fat to achieve a rich flavor when you eat it.

That said, don't cut down on fat too much and eat tasteless food.

So in the end, the low-carb high-fat diet mentioned in this video is...

It's a diet that suggests eating an appropriate amount of carbohydrates and an appropriate amount of fats.

The more you reduce carbohydrates, the better it is.

It's not a diet where the more fat you add, the better it is.

And the second thing I often ask is

You are a working professional, living alone, and studying, and as a result...

I don't have time to prepare vegetables and such.

Meat and things like that can just be bought, so it's not a big problem.

I can't prepare the vegetables, so it's really difficult to stir-fry the meat.

Many people ask me how to do this.

If you look on the internet, you'll find mixed vegetables for sale.

They sell frozen mixed vegetables for about 3000 won per kilogram.

Chop the vegetables finely, similar to the way you would for fried rice.

We sell it in small packages of 1 kg.

If you buy this and pour about 1/3 of it, it will weigh 300g, right?

You can stir-fry that and eat it with the meat.

So if you look for it, there are plenty of ways, and there are easy methods too.

Don't think too hard about it. If I'm struggling because of this...

You can approach it by looking for a way to solve it.

It's not a difficult diet, nor is it a dangerous one.

I think it would be good to approach it slowly.
