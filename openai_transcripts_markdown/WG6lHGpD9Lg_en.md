Will getting growth hormone injections help with weight loss? - Age-related weight loss Part 3

All videos have subtitles.

If you can't see the subtitles, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

In part 1 of the video, we discussed the reasons why people in their 20s can gain weight.

In the second part of the video, we talked about the decrease in growth hormone, which is a cause of age-related weight gain.

At the end of Part 2 of the video, there was a question about growth hormone injections.

In this video, let's talk about this.

To conclude, it is difficult to say that getting growth hormone injections is beneficial for dieting.

In the last video, we talked about how growth hormone has a positive effect on dieting.

Yes, that's right.

However, that is only in cases where growth hormones are produced within the body.

Among those who are dieting, there are quite a few people who are interested in liposuction.

It requires a lot of money, and there is a burden of surgery and potential side effects, but...

Since it physically removes fat from the body, the fastest way to reduce body fat is indeed through this method.

The problem is whether you can maintain that state.

There must be a reason why there is so much body fat accumulated to the point of needing liposuction in the first place.

There is a problem with the diet or lifestyle pattern.

If the cause of accumulated body fat is not addressed,

Even if you lose body fat through liposuction, body fat will eventually accumulate again.

For example, there is a hole in the jar, and water is leaking out.

If you keep adding water without sealing the hole, the water in the jar will eventually leak out.

The same goes for growth hormones.

Liposuction is a physical removal process.

Since growth hormone affects the body itself, wouldn't it be different?

It is the same for things that affect the body itself.

There are many diet products and supplements that affect the body itself.

There are products made with ingredients that have been experimentally confirmed to actually have a dieting effect.

However, there aren't many people who have lost weight by using such products.

Most people say they've tried it but found it ineffective.

Of course, every person's body is different, so the same effect cannot occur for everyone.

Still, there should be more people who experience effects than those who do not.

Why are there more people who are ineffective?

It is for the same reason as liposuction.

Without improving the diet and lifestyle patterns that contribute to obesity,

Even if you lose weight by taking diet products, you will gain it back again.

There are so many comments asking about the effectiveness of diet products.

I had created a response video.

The link is going out at the top right.

For those who want more details, you can click the link in the upper right corner to view it.

Returning to the original story.

Growth hormone definitely helps with dieting.

However, improving your diet and lifestyle patterns to stimulate the release of growth hormones in the body and

It can't be the same as just injecting growth hormones while having a messed-up diet and lifestyle.

In fact, receiving growth hormone injections may not be better.

Basically, the human body develops with use and weakens with disuse.

When you exercise, your muscles develop through muscle growth, and when you don't exercise, your muscles weaken due to muscle loss.

Many people suffer from back pain as they age.

One of the reasons is that the muscles in the lower back that support the spine become weak.

In such cases, wearing a brace that supports the spine instead of relying on the back muscles can reduce pain.

However, wearing a support belt is merely a temporary measure, not a solution.

Because of the brace, the muscles in the lower back can become weaker.

When the abdominal belt takes over the function of the back muscles, the back muscles will be used less.

If you don't use it, muscle loss will occur, and your muscles will become weaker.

So if you have back pain due to weak back muscles,

The solution to this problem is not a support belt, but exercises that strengthen the core muscles.

In the same concept, the decrease in growth hormone is causing weight gain with age.

If you receive growth hormone injections and supply growth hormone from outside,

Our bodies no longer need to produce growth hormones on their own.

In this case, the growth hormone produced in the body decreases further, and it's inevitable that age-related weight gain will increase.

What happens if you keep getting growth hormone injections?

It seems realistically impossible, but even if it were possible, there would be other issues.

In the last video, it was mentioned that growth hormone activates cell division and inhibits cell death.

This way, the total amount of cells increases.

This process will result in effects that are helpful for dieting.

The problem is that the human body is made up entirely of cells.

This means that there can be side effects from having too many cells in other areas.

For example, there is acromegaly, where the hands and feet become excessively large.

There is always a possibility of other side effects occurring besides this.

So, you need to make a very careful decision about getting growth hormone injections.

So if you want to lose age-related weight or don't want to gain age-related weight,

It means that we need to increase the production of growth hormones in the body, right?

What should I do?

In the next video, we will discuss ways to promote the secretion of growth hormone.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 4 of the weight loss series.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
