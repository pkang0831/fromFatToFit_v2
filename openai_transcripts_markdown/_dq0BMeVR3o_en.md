The topic of this video is whether you can eat sweet potatoes and potatoes on a low-carb, high-fat diet.

A question with the following content was posted in the comments.

You said to eat carbohydrates from vegetables and fruits.

Can I eat vegetables like sweet potatoes and potatoes, which are starchy vegetables?

The reason for asking this question is likely because the person asking is limiting their intake of potatoes and sweet potatoes in the low-carb, high-fat diet they are following.

There is something you need to know before answering the question.

There is not just one type of low-carb, high-fat diet.

A low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet is a concept.

A low-carb, high-fat diet refers to a diet in which the calories obtained from fat are greater than those obtained from carbohydrates.

If this condition is met, it all falls under low-carb, high-fat.

There are several ways to meet these conditions.

If you increase your fat intake while maintaining your carbohydrate intake, the calories from fat will increase compared to the calories from carbohydrates.

You can continue to eat fat while reducing your carbohydrate intake.

There is also a way to reduce carbohydrate intake while increasing fat intake.

You can reduce the intake of both carbohydrates and fats, but you can reduce fats relatively less.

Because there are various ways to execute it, a phenomenon of diet diversification occurs.

That's why it's called a low-carb, high-fat diet, but there are various diets such as ketogenic, Atkins, Paleo, and LCHF.

These diets are all different.

The rules are different because the diets are different.

In a ketogenic diet, the intake of potatoes and sweet potatoes is restricted.

In the Longe diet that I am talking about, the consumption of potatoes and sweet potatoes is allowed.

For those who are unsure about the differences in diet.

In the past, I had a video among many titled "Understanding the Low-Carb High-Fat Diet."

This video explains in detail, so if you want to know more, please click the video link in the top right.

Since this is a video I made initially, my voice has been altered.

I apologize if the voice modulation is uncomfortable for anyone.

The ketogenic diet argues, based on its theory, that one should not eat potatoes or sweet potatoes.

In the pkang diet, based on my theory, it is acceptable to eat potatoes and sweet potatoes.

The questioner has listened to both theories.

If you find the ketogenic diet convincing, you can limit potatoes and sweet potatoes.

On the contrary, if my story is convincing, you can eat potatoes and sweet potatoes.

First, I will summarize both theories.

The theory of the ketogenic diet is

Normally, people use carbohydrates as their main source of energy.

When carbohydrates are severely restricted, the body enters a state of ketosis and uses fat as its primary source of energy.

The theory is that by using fat as the main energy source, one can lose weight by utilizing body fat.

Conversely, when the state of ketosis is broken,

It is said that not using fat as an energy source is why dieting is not effective.

Therefore, the intake of potatoes and sweet potatoes, which can break the state of ketosis, is limited.

People who follow a ketogenic diet continuously check whether ketones are being produced in their bodies.

The theory behind the Longo diet is what?

I believe that it is possible to reduce body fat even without entering a state of ketosis.

So there is no need to strictly limit potatoes and sweet potatoes.

If it is true that fat loss does not occur unless one enters a state of ketosis,

This kind of diet cannot be a weight loss diet.

Breakfast consists of 1 sweet potato, 1 chicken breast, and 1 glass of milk.

Lunch is brown rice and vegetable salad.

For dinner, I have a meal plan that includes two sweet potatoes.

Most of the nutrients are in the form of carbohydrates.

Roughly calculated, the amount of carbohydrates is about 120 to 130 grams.

To maintain a state of ketosis on a ketogenic diet, it is said that one should consume less than 50g of carbohydrates.

So, we limit the intake of potatoes and sweet potatoes.

Since this diet includes more than 100g of carbohydrates, it obviously cannot enter a state of ketosis.

Then body fat should not decrease.

This diet is a celebrity diet.

It is a celebrity diet aimed at achieving a lower body fat percentage than that of the average person.

I am dieting to reduce body fat with this meal plan and engaging in broadcasting activities.

In other words, just by looking at this, it is possible to reduce body fat even without being in a state of ketosis.

I don't think there is a need to limit potatoes or sweet potatoes.

Sounds plausible, right?
