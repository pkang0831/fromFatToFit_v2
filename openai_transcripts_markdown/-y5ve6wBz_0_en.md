The Error of the Caloric Diet Theory that Causes Anorexia - Eating Disorders Part 2

This is the second video about eating disorders.

In the first video, we talked about how I can manage to skip breakfast and lunch, but I tend to binge eat in the evening.

In this video, I would like to talk about the causes of anorexia.

The causes of anorexia are quite diverse, but the four main causes are as follows.

The first is the error of the calorie diet theory.

The second is a distorted perception of weight.

The third is the distorted perception that being thin will inevitably make one beautiful.

The fourth is the desire for recognition.

Although I have categorized it into four types to explain the causes and coping methods,

In fact, these causes are all connected.

The desire to be recognized by others leads to an interest in beauty.

Because of the perception that being thin will automatically make one beautiful, people become concerned about their weight.

Due to a distorted perception of weight, people resort to extreme dieting.

Most of those extreme diets are based on calorie restriction.

The error in the calorie diet theory is the problem.

I will tell the story one by one in order.

The theory of calorie dieting is

The theory is that in order to lose weight, the calories consumed by the body must be greater than the calories obtained from food.

The theory itself is very simple, making it easy to understand.

At first glance, it seems to have no errors, which is why many people believe in this theory.

According to the calorie diet theory, in order to lose weight, you need to...

You need to either reduce the calories you get from food or increase the calories your body burns.

Increasing the calories your body consumes is a very difficult task because...

In most cases, people choose methods to reduce the calories obtained from food.

So when I am on a diet, I try to eat less food.

And this thought develops into the belief that eating food prevents weight loss, and that eating leads to gaining weight.

When it gets severe, there is a sense of aversion to eating food itself.

However, there is a significant flaw in the calorie diet theory.

For example, the calories obtained from food are 100.

In a state where the body maintains balance with a calorie consumption of 100.

If you reduce the amount of food you eat and lower the calories obtained from food to 50,

It will be a diet of 50 units of deficiency.

This is the calorie diet theory.

So even if you reduce the amount of food you eat and the calories you get from food decrease,

The theory holds that the calories consumed by the body must remain at a constant 100.

But in reality, it's not like that.

If you reduce the amount of food you eat, your calorie intake will decrease.

Our bodies adjust the calories we burn to match the reduced calorie intake.

The calories consumed by the body decrease by 50 to match the calories obtained from food.

In this case, even if you reduce your food intake to 50, you won't lose weight.

If you eat the same amount of food you used to eat, which is 100, it can actually lead to gaining weight.

In short, dieting becomes difficult while gaining weight becomes easy.

The phenomenon of the body consuming fewer calories when the amount of food eaten is reduced.

It is expressed as having a lowered basal metabolic rate, entering starvation mode, or entering hibernation mode.

If you lose weight by starving yourself, your basal metabolic rate decreases, making it easier to gain weight.

The reason you shouldn't lose weight by starving yourself is because of this.

However, I've heard that not eating or eating less doesn't actually lower your basal metabolic rate.

Recently, there have been many discussions about that, and I've seen quite a few similar questions in the comments as well.

The main questions that come up are generally three.

I heard that even if you eat less or starve, your basal metabolic rate does not decrease.

In the past, humanity struggled to find food, which often led to hunger.

If starvation lowers the basal metabolic rate and reduces muscle mass, humanity would have long since starved to death.

It doesn't make sense to say that fasting lowers the basal metabolic rate.

Breaking down muscle to use it as a third source of energy is a very inefficient process.

The body fat that was stored to be used in a situation where it is difficult to obtain food in the first place.

Why would the body break down muscle for energy instead of using stored body fat?

So it doesn't make sense that eating less would break down muscle to use it as energy.

These are quite interesting stories and contain enough content to raise questions.

So why does muscle loss occur when fasting, and how does the basal metabolic rate decrease?

I created a series of videos that explain in detail.

The link to the series is available at the top right.

For those who are curious about the details, you can click to see more.

So, do you think that not starving is good for dieting, Mr. pkang?

What do you think about intermittent fasting?

Every time I talk about not starving, questions about intermittent fasting come up.

The essence of intermittent fasting is not starving.

Due to binge eating caused by processed foods, I often eat more food than necessary.

So, the hormonal system becomes disrupted, the organs are overworked, and weight is being gained.

Let's have a fasting period without eating food to reduce the intake of processed foods.

If you reduce the intake of refined foods, there will be no binge eating caused by refined foods.

You can reduce the amount of food you were eating too much to a moderate amount.

In that case, we can solve various problems caused by overeating.

This is intermittent fasting.

So, let's reduce the amount of food we were eating too much of to a proper portion by switching to refined foods.

One of those methods is to use fasting, which is intermittent fasting.

Eating less or starving to reduce calorie intake is not intermittent fasting.

This is a low-calorie diet.

I explained this part in detail in the intermittent fasting series.

For those who are curious about intermittent fasting, please click the link in the top right.

You can refer to the intermittent fasting series.

In summary, there is a significant error in the calorie diet theory that many people believe in.

Due to this error, there is a perception that eating less food is good for dieting, but

In reality, it is not like that.

Rather than reducing the amount of food, it's important to change the types of food you eat.

However, even if you go from overweight to normal, isn't it difficult to go from normal to slim?

It seems that celebrities all weigh less than 50 kg.

Yes, you can think that way.

And such thoughts develop into a distorted perception of weight, which is the second cause of anorexia.

In the next video, I will talk about distorted perceptions of weight.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the eating disorder series,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
