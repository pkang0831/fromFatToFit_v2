Hello, this is pkang.

I recently saw comments on YouTube saying that it's inconvenient to watch without subtitles.

However, all the videos I create provide subtitles.

I am using the YouTube subtitle feature.

It seems that there are some people who don't know how to turn on YouTube subtitles, so I will explain it to you.

If you are watching on a computer, you will see a subtitle button at the bottom right of the video screen.

Press the subtitle button to display the subtitles.

If you are viewing this on a smartphone,

Please touch the screen once to open the menu.

You can adjust the subtitle settings by tapping the three-dot button in the upper right corner.

If you set the subtitles, they will be displayed.

All the videos I upload come with subtitles.

If the speech is too fast or difficult to understand due to voice modulation, please make good use of the subtitle feature.

If there are people who already know this feature, I would appreciate it if you could let those who don't know yet.
