Does drinking bulletproof coffee help you lose weight? - Bulletproof Coffee Part 1

Hello, this is pkang.

There have been many questions about bulletproof coffee in the comments, so in this video, I will talk about bulletproof coffee.

Let's briefly go over what bulletproof coffee is.

You can think of it as a drink made by adding fats like butter or oil to coffee.

There are various stories about this bulletproof coffee.

Among them, the aspect that most people are interested in is whether it has a weight loss effect.

In this video, I will talk about this.

Drinking bulletproof coffee promotes active fat burning, which can aid in weight loss.

This claim is that drinking bulletproof coffee increases metabolism, leading to a reduction in body fat.

It is claimed that drinking bulletproof coffee allows the body to use fat as a primary energy source, leading to a reduction in body fat.

First, it is true that there is an increase in metabolism when drinking bulletproof coffee.

When you actually drink bulletproof coffee, you can easily feel an increase in energy or a rise in body temperature.

An increase in metabolic rate means that energy consumption is increasing.

The claim is that when energy consumption increases, body fat naturally decreases.

The flaw in this argument is that it's not just bulletproof coffee, but regular coffee also has an effect on increasing metabolism.

I recently made a series of videos about coffee and dieting.

In this series, drinking coffee causes the body to become alert due to the caffeine in the coffee.

It was said that the metabolic rate of the body increases in an awakened state.

In the past, there were claims that simply drinking coffee would lead to weight loss based on this increase in metabolic rate.

The increased amount of saliva during the state of arousal is replenished after the state of arousal ends.

It was said that simply drinking coffee does not have a weight loss effect.

Korean women drink a lot of coffee.

If simply drinking coffee could lead to weight loss, many Korean women would not have any concerns about dieting.

This part is covered in detail in the coffee and diet video, so...

It is recommended to watch them in order.

So, the increase in metabolic rate is not due to the effects of the butter and oil in bulletproof coffee.

Because of the effects caused by the caffeine in coffee.

If the goal is to increase metabolism, there’s no need to specifically drink bulletproof coffee.

What effects do the butter and oil in bulletproof coffee have?

The answer to this question is connected to the second argument.

The main energy theory suggests that the primary energy varies depending on the nutrients consumed.

The human body stores two types of energy: carbohydrates and fats.

If you have a diet primarily based on carbohydrates, you will use carbohydrates as your main source of energy.

If you have a diet focused on fats, your body will use fat as its primary source of energy.

To reduce the body fat accumulated in the body, you need to use fat as the primary source of energy.

The theory is that in order to use fat as the main source of energy, one must follow a diet focused on fat.

In the case of a diet based on this theory

There is a rule that states you should consume more than 70% of your daily calorie intake from fat.

There is a rule that states you should reduce carbohydrate intake until ketones are produced in the body.

When you add butter and oil to coffee without any other additives,

Without carbohydrates, most of the calories come from fat.

This bulletproof coffee helps turn the main energy source into fat.

So the claim is that just drinking bulletproof coffee can help with dieting.

This claim has one flaw.

A person who has become obese by eating processed foods like chicken, pizza, cola, and snacks.

To diet, I cut out all those foods.

If someone follows a diet of chicken breast and sweet potatoes, what will happen to them?

If you strictly adhere to your diet, your body fat will decrease and you will lose weight.

However, refined foods like chicken, pizza, and cola are high in carbohydrates and are primarily carbohydrate-based foods.

Chicken breast is protein, and sweet potatoes are carbohydrates.

This person has never consumed more than 70% of their total calories from fat.

Since I am consuming carbohydrates from sweet potatoes, my body is not producing ketones.

If the main energy theory is correct, this person's primary energy source is still carbohydrates.

If that's the case, since the main energy source is not fat, body fat should not be easily lost.

The chicken breast and sweet potato diet is quite effective in reducing body fat when followed properly.

Of course, there are issues related to a low-calorie diet, and it can be challenging to maintain such a diet.

So I don't recommend that kind of diet either, but...

Even if ketones are not produced in the body, and even if a diet focused on fats is not followed,

This serves as evidence that there is no problem in burning body fat.

I heard that a diet focused on fats is necessary because of the insulin hormone.

Eating foods made up of refined carbohydrates like chicken, pizza, cola, and snacks

My blood sugar is rising quickly and significantly.

To lower this blood sugar, a large amount of insulin hormone is secreted.

It is true that the large amount of insulin secreted is a cause of obesity.

However, if the cause is the excessive secretion of insulin due to refined carbohydrates, then...

By not eating refined carbohydrates or reducing their intake.

As long as you reduce the amount of insulin secreted, the goal will be achieved.

For example, consuming 70% of total calories from fat.

Restricting carbohydrates until ketones are produced in the body is a separate matter.

It is correct to say that additional conditions have been added.

In summary, bulletproof coffee itself does not have a weight loss effect.

So, if you only add bulletproof coffee while keeping all other conditions the same,

It doesn't have a weight loss effect.

I heard that there are people who have seen weight loss effects from drinking bulletproof coffee. What are these people like?

If you maintain the same conditions, drinking bulletproof coffee additionally will not have any effect.

It is effective to use the feeling of fullness from drinking bulletproof coffee to reduce meal portions in a diet.

Depending on how this method is utilized, it can be effective for some people while not for others.

In the next video, I will talk about this question.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will set it up so that the next video appears on the right side when it's completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the bulletproof coffee video, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making it.
