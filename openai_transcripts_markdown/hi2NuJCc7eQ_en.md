A diet that keeps you full is great, but there’s a problem during hungry times.

The reason we become obese is that we eat food more often and in larger quantities than necessary.

The reasons for eating food more often and in larger quantities than necessary are

Processed refined foods are said to increase appetite.

So, if you reduce refined foods and structure your diet with unrefined foods,

Because the abnormally high appetite is returning to normal.

I am satisfied even without eating a lot.

Because the feeling of fullness lasts a long time, you end up eating less frequently.

I want to eat and I'm hungry, but instead of enduring that, I'm on a diet.

You can diet while feeling full.

However, the satiety from unrefined foods lasts too long, which does not align with my lifestyle.

A comment with this content has been posted.

I had breakfast with unrefined food.

I felt full for a long time, so I wasn't hungry at lunch.

So I didn't have lunch.

As time passed and it became around 2 to 3 PM, I started to feel hungry.

The problem is that from 2 to 3 PM is work time, so I can't eat.

The food that can be eaten is snacks like chips.

Snacks are not good for dieting, so I don't know what to do.

Or I wasn't hungry in the evening, so I didn't have dinner.

I’m trying to sleep in a few hours, but I’m hungry.

It's hard to sleep because I'm hungry.

I know that not getting enough sleep is not good for dieting.

That said, eating and then going to sleep right away is not good for dieting either.

I plan to stay up later, eat, and then try to sleep a few hours after eating.

I can't do that because of the commute time. What should I do?

This is a comment with such content.

Simply put, it means that the times I feel hungry do not align with my lifestyle pattern.

The solution is simple.

You can adjust your schedule to match the times when you feel hungry.

So, to avoid getting hungry between 2 and 3 PM, have a meal during lunchtime or

You can have your meal during dinner time so that you won't be hungry right before going to bed.

But you said that if you're not hungry, you shouldn't eat, right, pkang?

Yes, that's right.

The purpose of all living beings, including humans, is survival.

A state of obesity with high body fat is not advantageous for survival.

Therefore, when our body accumulates too much body fat,

The body has a response to try to reduce that on its own.

Because of this, the more severely obese individuals tend to lose body fat quickly in the early stages of dieting.

The closer you get to your goal, the harder it becomes to diet.

If the body reduces its own body fat, it can obtain a lot of energy from the body fat.

Because I don't need food.

The hormone that makes you feel hungry is not released, so you don't want to eat.

In this situation, there is no need to eat food.

Eating food can interfere with dieting.

Because when we eat food, a hormone called insulin is released.

One of the functions of this insulin is to increase body fat.

While insulin is being released, the burning of body fat is suppressed.

When insulin hormone actually increases, the glucagon hormone that burns body fat decreases.

If you are not hungry because of this, then it means you are in a situation where food is not needed.

In such a situation, not eating food to allow body fat to burn is said to be good for dieting.

So I said that if you don't want to eat, then don't eat.

However, the current situation is not one where food is unnecessary.

I feel hungry because I need food, but that time doesn't fit my lifestyle pattern.

I need to align the times when I feel hungry with my daily routine.

So, are you saying that I should force myself to eat even if I'm not hungry during lunchtime?

But isn't that bad for dieting?

You can adjust the amount of food you eat in the morning so that you feel hungry by lunchtime.

If you reduce the amount of food you eat in the morning, the duration of satiety will be shorter.

Then you must be hungry during lunch time.

And in some cases, there is also the method of not eating breakfast at all.

If you skip breakfast, you'll end up binge eating at lunch.

They say you should definitely eat breakfast because it's not good for your diet if you don't.

Yes, that's right.

If I skip breakfast, I get hungry from 10 AM.

As I endure this hunger while working,

During lunch time, I tend to binge eat as a form of reward psychology.

This can become a problem.

The key issue is whether you binge eat or not, not whether you eat breakfast or not.

So, if you skip breakfast but don't really binge at lunch,

It is not necessary to have breakfast.

In the intermittent fasting diet method, which involves fasting for 16 hours a day and eating for 8 hours,

To maintain a 16-hour fasting period, it is advised to intentionally skip breakfast.

If you eat the right foods in sufficient amounts during an 8-hour meal period,

Even if you fast for 16 hours including breakfast, it is possible not to binge eat.

If intermittent fasting is done correctly, it helps regulate appetite.

It becomes easier to maintain a 16-hour fast.

You can avoid binge eating during the 8-hour meal period.

On the contrary, if intermittent fasting is done incorrectly, appetite may not be controlled.

So there are times when people binge eat after the fasting period ends.

In this case, while adhering to the rules of intermittent fasting with a 16-hour fast and an 8-hour eating window,

I am not practicing intermittent fasting; I am engaging in intermittent binge eating.

Of course, it wouldn't be good for a diet.

So to summarize,

When you receive some diet information

Don't interpret it superficially and try to adhere to it obsessively.

Why there is such diet information and in what situations it is applicable.

You need to understand that essence.

If it's said that eating breakfast is good for dieting, even if I'm full, I force myself to eat breakfast.

If it's said that skipping breakfast is good for dieting, then even if I'm hungry, I force myself to skip breakfast.

I’m not hungry during lunch or dinner time, but I always feel hungry after 2 or 3 hours.

Since I was told not to eat if I'm not hungry, I just skip lunch and dinner.

Don't do it like this.

If I skip breakfast, I end up binge eating at lunch.

Then, in order to prevent binge eating at lunch, you need to have breakfast.

Even if I skip breakfast, I don't binge eat at lunch.

That means there is no need to have breakfast.

Since I had a big breakfast, I felt full until lunch.

I don't want to eat food for lunch.

So I skipped lunch, and now I'm hungry around 2 or 3 PM.

Then, by reducing the amount of food eaten in the morning, the duration of satiety can be shortened.

I made myself hungry for lunch and then had lunch.

You just need to make sure you're not hungry around 2 or 3 PM.

If you are always hungry before going to bed, you can eat a little food about 3 to 4 hours in advance.

So if my lifestyle pattern doesn't match the diet...

You just need to adjust it to match that.
