To lose age-related weight, you must do this - Age-related weight loss Part 4.

All videos have subtitles.

If you can't see the subtitles, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the fourth video about age-related weight gain.

In the first part of the video, I talked about how people in their late 20s can gain weight due to aging.

In the second part of the video, it was mentioned that the cause of gaining weight as we age is a decrease in growth hormone.

In part 3 of the video, we talked about growth hormone injections.

In this video, we will discuss how to increase the secretion of growth hormone.

I would like to talk about ways to actually lose age-related weight.

Since the content continues from the last video, it would be good to watch the previous videos in order.

The playlist link is displayed at the top right.

Basically, the human body changes according to necessity.

The main function of muscles in the human body is to enable movement.

If you apply a strong load with heavy weight, it will require a lot of force to move it.

Muscle mass develops according to that need.

So when you exercise with heavy equipment, your muscles develop.

Even if you don't exercise at all, if you gain weight and become heavier,

In the process of supporting and moving that heavy body, muscles can develop.

Because of this, individuals with severe obesity have a high muscle mass due to their heavy weight, even if they have no experience with exercise.

If you want to increase the secretion of growth hormone to lose age-related weight,

You need to understand the role of growth hormone in the body and increase the necessity of that role.

In the last video, it was mentioned that growth hormone increases the number of overall cells.

To achieve this, cell division, which increases the number of cells, is activated.

The decrease in the number of cells must be suppressed.

First, to activate cell division, two main things are needed.

The first is protein, and the second is exercise.

Proteins play a role in providing the materials necessary for cell division.

Exercise increases the necessity for cell division.

When you exercise, your muscles develop, so it seems like cell division in the muscles would occur more effectively.

Is cell division only necessary in muscles?

When we talk about exercise, we mainly focus on muscles.

Many people misunderstand that only muscles develop when exercising.

Exercise doesn't only develop muscles.

When you put stress on your body through exercise, your muscles can develop, but

The bones and ligaments that support and move the body will also develop.

When you actually exercise, the bone density increases.

It is often recommended to exercise to prevent osteoporosis.

It's not just the end here; exercise also has the effect of developing the heart and lungs.

When you use your muscles a lot through exercise, they require a lot of oxygen and energy.

The lungs are responsible for supplying oxygen to the body.

Oxygen and energy are delivered to the muscles through the blood.

To send this blood to the muscles, the heart must be strong.

In fact, exercising has the effect of strengthening cardiovascular capacity.

It has the effect of preventing cardiovascular diseases.

This is not the end; the function of the digestive system will also be enhanced.

The development of muscles, bones, and ligaments through exercise is due to the activation of cell division in those areas.

In order for cell division to occur, materials that make up the cell are needed.

The digestive system is what supplies these ingredients to the body.

If the digestive system is weak, even if you eat food, it is not properly absorbed by the body.

If it is not absorbed, it cannot be used as material for cell division.

So when you exercise, the function of the digestive system also develops.

This is not the end; exercising also helps develop brain function.

In fact, there are statistics showing that students who excel in sports tend to have higher average grades.

There are also cases where exercising has been linked to an increase in IQ.

Research has shown that people who engage in high-intensity exercise have better memory abilities than those who do not exercise.

So exercise is not just about developing muscles, but also...

It has the effect of strengthening and developing our entire body.

This process has the effect of actively promoting cell division throughout the entire body.

What kind of exercise should I do?

To strengthen bones or ligaments, should I do weightlifting with heavy barbells?

There is no specific exercise that is clearly defined.

You can do weight training or bodyweight exercises.

As long as I don't get injured, I can put more strain on my body than usual.

To put it extremely, for someone who usually has very low activity levels, just walking can be considered exercise.

So, do I just need to walk every day?

Walking every day helps your body develop, and as it becomes easier, it won't feel like a burden.

So once you become somewhat accustomed and it gets easier, you need to increase the intensity of your workout.

Oh? In that case... once you get used to exercising, increase the intensity.

Once you get used to that intensity, do you need to increase the intensity again? Is it necessary to keep raising it like this?

No, that's not the case.

As you continue to exercise consistently, the rate at which your body develops gradually slows down.

At some point, when you engage in exercise of similar intensity, you will be able to consistently feel an appropriate level of load.

Then you can continue exercising at a similar intensity from then on.

You don't have to worry too much because you don't have to keep increasing the intensity of your workouts forever.

And to activate cell division, you need to get good sleep.

Basically, our bodies recover during the time we sleep.

And during this recovery process, cell division, such as muscle growth, is activated.

In fact, growth hormone is most actively secreted during deep sleep.

So there is a saying that muscles grow at night, and there is also the saying that eating and resting are part of exercising.

In summary, if you eat well, exercise, and sleep well,

As cell division is activated, it induces the secretion of growth hormones.

When growth hormone increases, it results in a reduction of age-related fat.

I understand about cell division, but what about cell death?

You mentioned that growth hormone activates cell division but also inhibits cell death, right?

Living in a way that activates cell division increases the secretion of growth hormones.

In that case, wouldn't the secretion of growth hormone increase even when living a lifestyle that suppresses cell death?

In the next video, let's talk about how to induce the suppression of cell death to increase the secretion of growth hormones.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 5 of the weight loss series,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
