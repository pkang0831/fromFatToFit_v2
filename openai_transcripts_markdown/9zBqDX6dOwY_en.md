Cheat days cannot prevent a decrease in basal metabolic rate - Cheat Day Part 2

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the second video about cheat day.

In the last video, I talked about the types and effects of cheat days.

One of the effects of a cheat day is that it helps to trick the body and prevent a decrease in the basal metabolic rate.

Is this really possible?

In this video, I will talk about this.

Since the content continues from the first video, it is better to watch them in order.

The playlist link is displayed at the top right.

Can a cheat day prevent a decrease in basal metabolic rate?

When discussing this topic, the most contentious part is

Is it possible to deceive the body?

On the side that argues it's possible to deceive the body on a cheating day, they mainly talk about the placebo effect.

If you give a patient a placebo that has no effect and tell them it is an effective medication,

For patients who believe that the placebo has an effect, symptoms actually appear that indicate it is effective.

Just by looking at this, it shows that it's possible to deceive the body.

In fact, this placebo effect is quite powerful.

In experiments to check the effectiveness of a drug, a placebo experiment is conducted simultaneously.

They tell everyone it's the real medicine and give them the drug, but...

The truth is that it is divided into a real drug group and a placebo group.

Let's return to the original story.

Just looking at this placebo effect, it is entirely possible to deceive the body.

Therefore, it is possible to trick your body with a cheat day.

On the other hand, those who argue that it's impossible to deceive the body with a cheat day talk about reality.

To use a smartphone, you need to charge the battery.

However, by charging the battery only 10% each day and occasionally charging it to 100%,

Is it possible to keep the smartphone from turning off?

Of course, it is impossible.

No matter how much you try to deceive, in reality, the battery is low.

If the battery is actually low, the smartphone will turn off.

Of course, the human body is not a machine like a smartphone, but...

Anyway, in order for a person to live and move, energy is actually consumed.

If you eat less food, the energy that enters your body will decrease.

The actual energy used will decrease.

In that case, it doesn't make sense that the body, which is actually using energy, doesn't know about it.

Even if it's possible to deceive temporarily, it will inevitably be discovered over time.

In the first place, dieting is not something to be done in the short term; it should be done over a long period.

It means that deceiving your body on a cheat day is impossible.

Both sides of the argument seem plausible, but whose claim is correct?

It doesn't really matter.

Whether it's possible to deceive the body or not, it doesn't really matter.

Because there are contradictions within the story itself.

In the calorie diet theory, what was the reason for needing to follow a low-calorie diet?

If the calories consumed by the body are less than the calories obtained from food,

To supplement the insufficient calories, body fat is used as energy.

That's why it leads to dieting.

However, if the calories obtained from food continue to be insufficient,

Our body recognizes that "it is a difficult situation to find food right now."

To adapt to that situation, the body lowers its basal metabolic rate, which is the number of calories it consumes.

When the basal metabolic rate decreases, it becomes difficult to lose weight and easy to gain weight.

The biggest problem with low-calorie diets is that they can lead to yo-yo dieting.

What was the reason that a cheat day could solve this problem?

When following a low-calorie diet, if I occasionally eat a lot of food on a cheat day,

Since I eat a lot, it becomes easier to obtain food.

This is because it is possible to deceive the body into thinking that food is not scarce.

However, there is a contradiction right here.

I am eating insufficient food, but...

If you succeed in tricking your body into thinking that there is no shortage of food on cheat day,

Our bodies come to perceive that there is no shortage of food.

Since there is no shortage of food, there is no need to use body fat as emergency food.

That's why the diet isn't working. It's because you're not using body fat.

On the contrary, if our body is using body fat, which is an emergency food source, to lose weight...

That means the body knows that there is a lack of food.

In that case, it means that I failed to trick my body on cheat day.

So, it means that having a cheating day while also being effective for dieting cannot coexist.

If cheat days are effective, then dieting is not working.

If dieting works, then cheat days are ineffective.

In this case, there would be no reason to have a cheat day.

The reason for trying to deceive the body with a cheat day is for the sake of dieting.

If a cheat day is effective but you still can't lose weight,

Since I can't stick to my diet, there's no reason to have a cheat day.

If you can't deceive your body on cheat days and it doesn't have any effect, then there's no reason to do it.

In reality, most people who diet on a low-calorie diet have cheat days.

However, most people who diet with a low-calorie diet experience a yo-yo effect.

Cheat days help prevent a decrease in basal metabolic rate.

It means that there is no effect in preventing yo-yo dieting.

However, there are people who say that they couldn't lose weight during a plateau, but after having a cheat day, their plateau was broken.

If cheat days are ineffective, then what about those people?

Cheat days do not have the effect of preventing a decrease in basal metabolic rate.

This is because the stagnation can be resolved under certain conditions.

It has a different effect than what was discussed in this video.

In the next video, I will talk about why a cheat day can break a plateau.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure the next video appears on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the cheating day.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
