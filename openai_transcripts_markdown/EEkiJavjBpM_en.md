Hello, this is pkang.

A question like the following was posted in the comments.

I heard that losing weight is about diet, while exercise is for shaping the body.

If Mr. pkang's explanation is correct, then is this a wrong story? That's the question.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

First, let me briefly explain the process that led to that question.

The body fat that accumulates in a person's body can be broadly divided into two types: visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Because the characteristics and tasks of the regions are different, I mentioned that the methods of removal are also different.

Visceral fat is located right next to the organs, making it easy to convert into energy.

So, diet is very effective in reducing visceral fat.

However, subcutaneous fat is the fat that covers the muscles just beneath the skin.

The distance in the intestines is too far, and it has characteristics that make it difficult to use as energy.

So the role of body fat is to protect the body from external shocks or impacts.

It serves the purpose of preventing the loss of body heat.

So, when you generate heat in your body through muscle and raise your body temperature,

The subcutaneous fat that used to prevent the loss of body heat is now hindering the maintenance of body temperature.

So, it was said that building muscle through exercise is effective in reducing body fat.

In the case of women, when body fat accumulates, it mainly accumulates as subcutaneous fat.

I mentioned that exercising is important for dieting.

After hearing the content up to this point,

So, is it incorrect to say that for women, dieting is for losing weight and exercise is for shaping the body?

You had this thought, which is why you asked the question. It's completely understandable to think this way.

I will talk about this.

First of all, when men accumulate body fat, it tends to accumulate primarily as visceral fat.

When a woman's body fat accumulates, it is true that it primarily accumulates as subcutaneous fat.

When one becomes severely obese, both men and women accumulate visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

First of all, in the case of men, it is true that visceral fat increases rapidly when body fat initially increases.

However, when visceral fat increases, the body becomes heavier and heavier.

To move a light object, a small amount of energy is sufficient.

Just like it takes a lot of energy to move a heavy object,

When the body becomes heavy, a lot of energy is consumed in movement.

However, our bodies have a survival instinct to reduce energy consumption.

When the body becomes heavy, the tendency to avoid movement unconsciously becomes stronger.

If this leads to severe obesity, it can cause a lot of inconvenience and make one less inclined to move around.

The reason there is less subcutaneous fat when there is more muscle is that heat is generated in the muscles.

If you don't move your body, you don't use your muscles, and if you don't use your muscles, heat is not generated.

So, even though there is a lot of muscle, since heat is not generated, subcutaneous fat becomes necessary for maintaining body temperature.

So even if it's a man, if he becomes severely obese and his activity level decreases, the amount of subcutaneous fat will increase.

In the case of women, when body fat accumulates, it tends to accumulate primarily as subcutaneous fat.

When subcutaneous fat accumulates, the body becomes heavier.

In the process of supporting and moving a heavy body, muscles develop.

Even a woman who has no experience with exercise at all

In the case of severe obesity, the reason for the high muscle mass reading on the InBody is because of this.

Since muscles are organs that consume energy, an increase in muscle mass should lead to an increase in the amount of stored visceral fat.

In case energy is used in the muscles.

The amount of visceral fat increases because it needs to serve the role of an energy tank to supply energy.

Because of this, in the case of men who have more muscle mass than women, body fat tends to accumulate primarily as visceral fat.

Similarly, if a woman gains weight, her muscles will develop due to the weight.

Due to this muscle, the necessity for visceral fat increases.

Even women can experience an increase in visceral fat when they become severely obese.

In a situation where one has become severely obese, if one diets with the right meal plan,

Regardless of gender, visceral fat will decrease rapidly.

Because I changed my diet, it has a direct effect on visceral fat.

When visceral fat decreases, body weight also decreases accordingly.

When you lose weight, the energy you expend when moving your body decreases, right?

The reason we tried not to move our bodies much is

My weight is too high, so a lot of energy is consumed when I move.

I was trying not to move in order to save this.

When weight decreases, there is a corresponding increase in activity levels.

For example, when someone is severely obese, they may need to go up one floor.

I choose to wait for the elevator rather than climb the stairs.

"When the weight decreases, it's about 'one floor down.'"

You choose to climb the stairs instead of waiting for the elevator.

When the light changes and you are a certain distance away from the crosswalk.

If you are severely obese, it is better to choose to walk slowly and wait for the next signal rather than running.

When weight decreases, rather than waiting for the next signal, one tends to choose to jump and cross all at once.

When physical activity increases, heat is generated in the muscles, and when heat is generated in the muscles, body temperature rises.

To lower the rising body temperature, the heat from the muscles needs to be expelled outside the body.

The insulating effect of subcutaneous fat interferes with this, leading to a reduction in the amount of subcutaneous fat.

So, through this process, even just by changing the diet,

Both my visceral fat and subcutaneous fat will decrease to a certain level.

So, just by changing your diet, it's possible to lose weight down to a normal weight.

This is the meaning of the phrase "losing weight is about diet."

After achieving a normal weight through your diet, if you want to reach a slimmer beauty weight,

I need to build muscle through exercise and reduce subcutaneous fat even more.

This process is about shaping the body line through exercise.

So the saying that you lose weight through diet and shape your body through exercise means that...

This applies to everyone, regardless of gender, and it's not necessarily incorrect.

Sounds plausible, right?
