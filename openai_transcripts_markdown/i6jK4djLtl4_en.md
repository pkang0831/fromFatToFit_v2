How to check if I am following the right diet plan.

One of the concerns for people who are dieting is that their basal metabolic rate decreases.

When the basal metabolic rate decreases, it becomes easier to gain weight.

This can lead to easily regaining weight even if you succeed in your diet.

So, I'm wondering if the diet I'm following is a wrong diet that lowers my basal metabolic rate.

Or I want to check if it's the right diet.

There are many cases where people feel frustrated because they don't know how to check.

In this video, we will learn how to check if I am following the right diet.

Isn't it okay to just eat more calories than your basal metabolic rate?

Even if you consume more calories than your basal metabolic rate, your basal metabolic rate can decrease.

The reason is simple.

This is because a person cannot absorb 100% of the calories from the food they eat.

It's said that eating foods rich in dietary fiber is good for dieting.

This is because dietary fiber interferes with digestion and absorption.

If we compare eating carbohydrates alone to eating them with dietary fiber,

When dietary fiber and carbohydrates are consumed together, blood sugar levels rise more slowly.

Dietary fiber interfered with digestion and absorption.

So it prevents all carbohydrates from being absorbed by the body.

In addition to this, brown rice and white rice have similar calorie counts, but brown rice has a husk, which makes it harder to digest.

So, when a person who used to eat white rice switches to brown rice, the absorption is reduced, which can lead to weight loss.

Even the same sweet potato can help with dieting when boiled, but it can lead to weight gain when baked.

So, the amount absorbed by the body varies depending on the type of food and how it is cooked.

In fact, if you think about it for a moment, it's quite obvious.

In order for a person to obtain calories from food, they must digest the food.

The human digestive system is not a machine, so its performance varies depending on the condition of the body.

Food varies in its digestibility, with some types being difficult to digest and others being easy to digest.

Ignoring all of this

It doesn't make sense to assume that all the calories I consumed have been absorbed by my body.

For this reason, even if you consume calories equal to your basal metabolic rate, it can still be considered a low-calorie diet.

Not all of those calories are absorbed by the body.

So how should I eat it?

Let's talk about that from now on.

Because it is said that following a low-calorie diet or fasting diet lowers the basal metabolic rate.

Some people worry that if they eat insufficient food for even a day, their basal metabolic rate will decrease.

Just because you eat less doesn't mean that your basal metabolic rate decreases immediately.

Because lowering the basal metabolic rate is a very dangerous action.

Basal metabolic rate is the energy consumed by major organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

To lower the basal metabolic rate, you need to weaken these major organs.

If the major organs weaken, it is natural that health will deteriorate.

And changing the body does not happen in a short period of time.

It progresses slowly over time.

So, the basal metabolic rate does not decrease immediately, but gradually decreases over time.

Even if the basal metabolic rate is decreasing because of this, it is not easy to recognize it at that time.

In reality, the majority of people on a low-calorie diet only realize the situation after the side effects have become serious.

Just because there is a shortage of food does not mean that the basal metabolic rate immediately decreases.

Before the basal metabolic rate decreases, other metabolic rates tend to decrease first.

And this can be used as an indicator to check if there are any issues with my current diet.

The energy a person consumes in a day consists of basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate.

The active metabolic rate is the energy expended during daily activities.

The exercise metabolic rate is the energy expended during exercise.

It takes a long time to lower the basal metabolic rate, and it also takes a long time to raise it again.

The basal metabolic rate and the exercise metabolic rate are not the same.

When physical activity and exercise decrease, both the active metabolic rate and the exercise metabolic rate decrease.

When the amount of activity and exercise increases, the metabolic rate for activity and exercise also increases.

There is almost no risk compared to the basal metabolic rate, and it can be changed quickly.

In situations where energy is lacking, there is a tendency to first reduce activity levels and exercise.

Simply put, if you don't eat properly, you lack energy and don't feel like moving.

If such a situation continues for a long time, it ultimately leads to a decrease in the basal metabolic rate.

Isn't it natural that you feel weak when you're on a diet?

It's not a given.

Exercising with heavy barbells increases the muscle mass in your body.

Similarly, if you live with a heavy body, your muscle mass will increase accordingly.

So a person who weighs 70 kg has muscles that can support and move that 70 kg.

If this person goes on a diet and reduces their weight to 60kg,

If you can lift and move 70kg with your muscles, then you should be able to lift and move just 60kg.

This way, the burden is reduced, which creates a sense of ease.

This relaxation leads to an increase in activity levels.

So when you diet, it's natural for your body to feel lighter and for it to be easier to move around.

This is normal.

And a lot of body fat causes inflammation in the body.

This inflammation puts a significant burden on the body, and that burden manifests as fatigue.

So, people with a lot of body fat get tired easily and don't recover well even after resting.

When body fat decreases due to dieting, this inflammation will decrease as well.

When inflammation decreases, fatigue will also decrease.

You can recover without getting too tired or taking a long break.

In that case, the level of activity will naturally increase.

So when you diet, your body condition should improve and your activity level should increase.

That's only natural.

In the first place, dieting is good for health.

If you have followed a healthy diet, your physical condition should naturally improve.

If you are on a diet but feel weak, don't want to move, and get tired easily,

The issue lies in the diet method, which is causing a decrease in activity levels and exercise.

If this situation is left unaddressed, it will ultimately lead to a decrease in basal metabolic rate.

Please check the current status.

If your activity level and exercise amount have decreased, it is advisable to change your dieting method.

What is intermittent fasting like? Does intermittent fasting lower the basal metabolic rate?

What should a person with a low basal metabolic rate do to recover?

When talking about basal metabolic rate, many related questions arise.

This is mostly the content I answered in the basal metabolic rate series I created earlier.

The answer to the question that just came out is also included in the video.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will set it up so that the basal metabolic rate series appears on the right.
