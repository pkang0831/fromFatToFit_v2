If it's not fattening food, can you lose weight even if you eat a lot?

Hello, this is pkang.

Recently, I have made several videos about foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight.

Is it okay to eat a lot if it's not fattening food?

Eating a lot of any food will lead to weight gain, while eating less will result in weight loss.

Don't watch videos like this, just eat less.

There are many comments like this being posted.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

I will start by stating the conclusion.

Eating a lot of any food will lead to weight gain, and eating a little of any food will lead to weight loss.

This is, of course, true.

Foods that help you lose weight are not magical foods that allow you to eat a lot and still lose weight.

Just because a food is considered fattening doesn't mean that eating even a little bit of it will make you gain a lot of weight.

Even foods that help you lose weight can cause you to gain weight if you eat them in large quantities.

Even if it's food that makes you gain weight, it's possible to diet if you eat just a little bit of it.

There is actually a diet where you eat white rice as it is while reducing the amount you consume.

Whether it's food that makes you gain weight or food that helps you lose weight, eating a lot will make you gain weight, and eating less will make you lose weight, right?

Then why do we categorize foods as fattening or weight-loss foods? There’s no real difference, right?

Because it affects appetite.

Usually, many people think that their appetite is a unique characteristic of themselves.

A person who has a strong appetite and eats a lot of food.

"I usually think, 'I have a strong appetite, so I eat a lot of food.'"

However, this appetite is greatly influenced by the type of food being eaten.

I briefly talked about how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight in the video.

Foods that cause weight gain are those that are high in nutrient content and are quickly digested and absorbed.

When you eat this kind of food, a lot of nutrients enter your body in a short amount of time.

When a large amount of nutrients comes in a short period of time, the body quickly secretes a lot of insulin to respond.

Insulin that is secreted in a hurry will inevitably be secreted in amounts greater than what is needed.

Insulin has several functions, including

Because it lowers blood sugar and also stores fat as body fat.

If insulin is secreted in excess, blood sugar levels will drop lower than necessary.

There are instances where unnecessary fat is stored as body fat.

This is where the problem starts.

Our bodies cannot have blood sugar levels that are too high, but they also cannot have blood sugar levels that are too low.

You must always maintain a consistent range.

So, if blood sugar levels drop too low due to excessive insulin secretion,

To raise the blood sugar again, one starts to crave food.

And when the fat that should be used for energy is stored as body fat,

Because there is a lack of energy to use right away, you start to crave food again.

Even if you have had a sufficient meal because of this, you will feel hungry again after 3 or 4 hours.

And if you eat fattening foods at this time, the same process will repeat.

I get hungry again after about 3 or 4 hours.

So it's not that hunger arises from a lack of food, but rather...

The hunger occurs because of the excessive secretion of insulin.

This type of hunger is called false hunger.

If you eat every 3 to 4 hours according to this false hunger,

I ate because I was hungry, but I ended up eating too much food.

It's not that I needed food, but I kept eating anyway.

This will gradually lead to obesity.

So, I often want to eat and have a strong appetite to eat a lot.

It's not the appetite I was born with.

It could be said that it is a false hunger caused by foods that make you gain weight.

On the contrary, foods that help you lose weight are not foods that allow you to eat a lot and still lose weight.

It refers to food that does not cause false hunger because a lot of nutrients do not enter the body in a short amount of time.

So, when we say that we eat the same amount of food,

Eating foods that make you gain weight creates a false sense of hunger, leading you to eat a lot in order to feel satisfied.

When you eat foods that help you lose weight, you don't experience false hunger, so you can feel satisfied even without eating a lot.

In fact, when looking at success stories of dieting,

There are often stories about how the stomach shrinks, so even a little food makes you feel full.

In fact, this phenomenon is not caused by the stomach shrinking.

During the process of dieting, I didn't eat foods that would make me gain weight.

This is a phenomenon that occurs when false hunger disappears.

It wasn't caused by a reduction in the stomach!?

If you eat small amounts of food, your stomach shrinks, and when your stomach shrinks, you feel full even after eating just a little.

If this is correct, then by fasting or following a low-calorie diet and eating smaller portions, the stomach will shrink.

If your stomach has shrunk, you should not gain weight again even if you eat only a little and feel full.

However, when dieting with fasting or a low-calorie diet,

Most people experience the yo-yo effect of gaining weight.

In fact, the statement that the stomach shrinks also implies that the stomach can expand.

It means that there is elasticity that allows it to shrink and expand.

And what is involved in the above size is appetite.

The above is an organ connected to the brain.

When the desire to eat more becomes strong, the size of the stomach increases.

So even if the stomach has shrunk, if the desire to eat remains the same,

The stomach expands to eat food, and eating a lot of food leads to obesity.

So, in order to avoid eating more than necessary, I need to eliminate my excessive appetite so that I can feel full even after eating just a little.

The way to eliminate excessive appetite is to avoid eating foods that create false hunger.

I will summarize.

Foods that make you gain weight refer to foods that create false hunger.

Foods that help you lose weight are those that do not create false hunger.

No matter what food you eat, if you eat a lot, you will gain weight, and if you eat less, you can lose weight.

In cases where one is dieting while eating foods that cause weight gain,

To diet, it is possible to forcefully suppress hunger and eat a small amount.

If you eat enough food to satisfy false hunger, then you are eating too much food.

However, if you change the types of food you eat to foods that help you lose weight,

Because there is no false hunger, you can lose weight without having to endure hunger.

When you feel full after a meal, the number of meals you have tends to decrease.

Even if you eat until you're full, the nutrient content may be low, or digestion and absorption may be slow.

In reality, the amount absorbed by the body actually decreases.

So, if you don't want to change the types of food you eat and you are someone who can endure hunger well,

You can lose weight by simply eating a little less of the food you usually eat and enduring your hunger.

However, for those who want to diet but keep failing because they can't resist hunger,

Changing the types of food you eat is said to be helpful.
