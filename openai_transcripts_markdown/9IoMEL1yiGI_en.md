Dieting goal weight of 45kg that leads to anorexia - Eating Disorders Part 3

This is the third video about eating disorders.

In the first video, the reason for binge eating every evening.

In the second video, we talked about the errors in the calorie diet theory.

In this video, we will talk about distorted perceptions of weight.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it is better to watch them in order.

If you haven't watched the previous video, please click the link in the top right.

You can look at them in order.

The biggest reason for the distorted perception of weight is due to the weight of celebrities.

Many people refer to celebrities' weights when setting their target weight for dieting.

Celebrities often wear outfits that reveal their figures on broadcasts.

This is because height and weight are disclosed through broadcasts or profiles.

The weight of female celebrities is often less than 50 kg.

In the past, when you searched for celebrities on the internet in Korea, their height and weight would be listed in their profiles.

However, in the case of female celebrities, most of them had their weight listed as 45 kg.

This became an issue on the internet, and articles were published about it.

So, the weight of 45kg is said to be a symbol of slimness in Korea.

If it is true that all female celebrities weigh 45 kg,

There must be a reason for your effort to reach 45kg.

In reality, I don't weigh 45kg, but if I were to deceive and write that I weigh 45kg in my profile, then...

There must be a reason why it needs to be written as 45kg.

The reason is that a weight of 45kg symbolizes being slim.

In a similar story, the most ideal body size for women is

There are also reports that the height is 168 cm and the weight is 45 kg.

However, there are some differences depending on height and body fat percentage.

In most cases, a weight of 50 kg or less is considered severely underweight.

Why has the perception that being extremely thin is attractive come about?

It is due to lens distortion in the broadcast.

This is something I talked about in the third part of the beauty weight video.

Most people think that the bodies of celebrities seen on television are exactly the same as in reality.

However, there is a significant difference between the appearance on the broadcast and the actual appearance.

The world we live in is three-dimensional, but the results captured by a camera are displayed on a flat surface.

In this process, a distortion phenomenon occurs where objects appear to be widely spread out.

This distortion phenomenon varies in degree depending on the lens.

Even if it's the same person, it depends on what lens was used.

It has a completely different effect.

The same person was photographed on the same day, but with different lenses.

There is quite a significant difference.

The lenses used in broadcast cameras are those that make objects appear more spread out.

In short, it means that the broadcast makes you look fatter than in real life.

Celebrities mostly meet their fans through broadcasts rather than in person.

So, the appearance that is shown on broadcast is more important than the actual appearance.

I am trying to lose weight until I have a body that looks good on television.

So, in reality, I have an extremely thin body, but due to the distortion of the camera, I appear to have a good figure.

To those who are unaware of this fact,

To achieve a celebrity's body shape, one tends to think that they need to reach a similar weight.

This kind of thinking creates the perception that being slim is achieved when weight is reduced to below 50 kg.

However, in the case of fans who actually create celebrities,

I was surprised to see how much thinner you looked compared to what I saw on the broadcast.

There are quite a few cases where a male celebrity who appears to be big on screen is surprisingly just tall.

There are fan clubs that send herbal medicine because they are worried that female idols in the 40kg range are too thin.

I will summarize.

The reason people want to weigh less than 50 kg is

It is due to the distorted perception of weight created by celebrities' body weight.

There is no need to obsess over a weight of 50 kg or less.

What's important is not the weight, but the muscle and body fat percentage.

However, even if I don't become obsessed, the world makes me obsessed.

Yes, that's right.

There is a distorted perception of weight that has spread throughout society.

So, even though the outward appearance clearly looks thin,

When I mention that my weight is over 50 kg,

"You're surprisingly fat, aren't you?" is something they say.

Why are you saying that when you actually look slim?

It is due to cognitive impairment or a suspected illness.

Cognitive impairment is the inability to properly perceive information that differs from one's own thoughts.

If your weight exceeds 50 kg, you may fall into the thought that you are overweight.

They are not fully aware of the information that they appear slim on the outside.

The disease of doubt is when one perceives the appearance correctly but suspects that it is different from reality.

If it exceeds 50kg, it would actually be considered overweight.

They think that they look slimmer through shapewear or styling.

How should cognitive disorders or suspected illnesses be treated?

This is not something that can be easily fixed just because someone else says they will fix it.

And there's no need to fix each one individually.

After all, weight is personal information that no one can know unless I say it.

If you don't mention your weight, you can only be judged by your outward appearance.

If you appear slim on the outside, you are perceived as slim even without mentioning your weight.

So, there's no need to be overly fixated on the number on the scale.

Well... I haven't reached 50kg, but I've tried dieting close to that weight, you know?

However, it wasn't a very slim figure.

It seemed like I had to lose a lot more weight, but then I would end up being similar to a celebrity's weight.

Why do I feel that way?

It is due to skinny obesity.

In the next video, we will talk about this.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure the next video appears on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the eating disorder series, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making the video.
