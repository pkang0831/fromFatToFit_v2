Hello, this is pkang.

This is the fourth video about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In Part 1 of the video, the types of low-carb, high-fat diets are discussed.

In the second part of the video, a hybrid diet created by mixing two different meal plans is introduced.

In part 3 of the video, we talked about refined and unrefined foods.

In this video, we will talk about a balanced diet.

Since the content of the video is all connected, it is recommended to watch them in order starting from Part 1.

For those who haven't watched the previous video, the playlist link is available in the top right corner.

If you click the link, you can view it in order starting from Part 1.

If you have watched the video in Part 3, you should have understood what refined and unrefined foods are.

You probably understand that in order to diet, you need to reduce the intake of refined foods and eat unrefined foods.

At the end of the video, it was mentioned that if you build your diet with unrefined foods, it will naturally become a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Because I talked about it in the first part of the video.

A low-carb, high-fat diet refers to a diet in which the calories obtained from fat are higher than those obtained from carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates provide 4 kcal per gram, and fats provide 9 kcal per gram.

Even if you eat carbohydrates at twice the amount of fat, the calories from fat are still higher.

In the third part of the video, regarding unrefined carbohydrates, if they are well digested and absorbed, the carbohydrate content is very low or

If the carbohydrate content is high, it is said that digestion and absorption will not occur well.

So if I intentionally try to eat less fat and not eat a lot of carbohydrates,

The calories obtained from fat are inevitably higher than those obtained from carbohydrates.

Let me give you an example to make it easier to understand.

A serving of meat is about 200 grams.

If you do not choose low-fat cuts like chicken breast or round steak, the fat content in 200g of meat is at least around 30g.

Unrefined carbohydrates come in a variety of types.

In the case of leafy vegetables, the average carbohydrate content is about 4g per 100g.

The carbohydrate content of fruits is an average of 10g per 100g.

The carbohydrate content of root vegetables is about 10 to 20 grams per 100 grams, so let's assume it is 20 grams.

If you eat 200g each of leafy vegetables, fruits, and root vegetables, totaling 600g, you will obtain 70g of carbohydrates.

Of the 70g, 15-20% is indigestible dietary fiber, so the actual carbohydrates excluding dietary fiber amount to about 60g.

The calories in 60g of carbohydrates are 240 kcal.

200g of meat with 30g of fat contains 270 kcal, which means the calorie content from fat is higher. This constitutes a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Isn't 600g of vegetables and fruits too much?

Yes, that's right. It's actually a very large amount to eat.

The reason for setting the criteria this way is that...

The standard portion for meat is set at 200g, which is easily consumable for one person.

I set the standard at 600g, which is a quantity of vegetables and fruits that is quite difficult to consume.

Even with this standard, it means that the calories obtained from fat are higher than those obtained from carbohydrates.

The actual amount of vegetables consumed will be less than 600g.

When choosing meat, you can select cuts that have a fat content of more than 15g per 100g.

Even if you choose a cut with low fat content, you can still add oil separately.

If you don't try to force yourself to eat less fat,

When you structure your diet with unrefined foods, it naturally becomes a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Even if you eat 600g of unrefined carbohydrates, it can still be a low-carb, high-fat diet.

It doesn't mean you have to eat 600g a day. You don't have to force yourself to eat 600g.

They only talk about vegetables and fruits, but they don't mention brown rice. Is it not good to eat brown rice?

You can eat brown rice.

Brown rice is in a form that still has the husk compared to white rice.

In terms of nutritional content, there isn't much difference between white rice and carbohydrate content.

So I left it out of the conversation to avoid confusion.

As mentioned in the video of Part 3

Brown rice has a skin, phytic acid, and dietary fiber that interfere with digestion and absorption.

The amount of carbohydrates actually absorbed by the body is much less than that of white rice.

There was a discussion that simply changing white rice to brown rice can have a dieting effect.

So, although the amount of carbohydrates in the nutritional content is high, the actual amount of carbohydrates absorbed by my body is low.

You can eat brown rice, and even if you eat brown rice, it will still be a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Now, let's think about the question that appeared at the end of Part 2 once again.

It seems that having a balanced diet would be the best option. Is it really necessary to follow a low-carb, high-fat diet?

So, what is a balanced diet?

It is said that a balanced diet consists of 60% carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 20% fat from the total calories.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has indeed set the standard for a balanced diet as 60% carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 20% fat.

So, how should I structure my diet to eat like that?

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a daily intake of 2000 kcal.

60% of 2000 kcal is 1200 kcal, and 1200 kcal of carbohydrates is 300g.

20% of 2000 kcal is 400 kcal, and 400 kcal of fat is 45g.

Then, carbohydrates are 300g and fats are 45g, which means carbohydrates are more than six times the amount of fats.

Is this really a balanced diet?

Moreover, 300g of carbohydrates is not an amount that can be consumed as unrefined carbohydrates.

In the beginning of the video, it was mentioned that if you eat a balanced 600g of vegetables and fruits, you can obtain 60g of carbohydrates.

To obtain 300g of carbohydrates, you need to eat five times that amount, which means you have to consume 3kg of vegetables and fruits.

It is not a reasonable amount to eat.

Isn't 2000 kcal too much?

2000 kcal a day is not that much, but even if we think of it as reducing it to 1500 kcal...

60% of 1500 kcal is 900 kcal, and 900 kcal of carbohydrates is 225g.

The carbohydrates obtained from 600g of vegetables and fruits are 60g.

To obtain 225g of carbohydrates from vegetables and fruits, you need to eat 2.2kg.

Considering that we need to eat meat to obtain protein and fat, 2.2 kg seems excessive.

So, it's impossible to consume 60% of your daily calories from carbohydrates through vegetables or fruits.

To consume 60% of your total calories from carbohydrates, you must eat grains.

Then a question arises here.

Is it necessary for humans to eat grains? Not necessarily.

In the entire history of humanity, the beginning of agriculture and the consumption of grains is a recent development.

Before that, we lived on vegetables and fruits obtained through gathering, and meat obtained through hunting.

So, humans have originally had a diet that derives more calories from fat than from carbohydrates.

Because of this, the body has evolved to store carbohydrates in small amounts and fats in large amounts.

It is hard to accept that one must eat grains in order to intentionally consume a lot of carbohydrates.

If there is a diet that requires eating a lot of fat, do you have to eat butter?

We do not consider this diet to be a balanced diet.

I think it's a diet that includes a lot of fat.

Similarly, if there is a diet that requires eating grains in order to consume a lot of carbohydrates,

This is a diet that consists of a lot of carbohydrates; it is not a balanced diet.

I will summarize.

Do I have to follow a low-carb, high-fat diet? I don't think it's necessary.

However, the best diet that I think is

It's about eating unrefined foods while intentionally consuming a lot of certain nutrients or not restricting anything.

If you eat like this, it will inevitably become a low-carb, high-fat diet.

What kind of diet do you think is a good diet, pkang?

In the following video, I will talk about what I consider to be a good diet.

There should be two videos on the screen right now. Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not part 6 of the low-carb, high-fat diet series, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making the video.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
