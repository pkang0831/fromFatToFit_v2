This is the fourth video about cheat days.

The topic of this video is the reason why you shouldn't relieve stress with a cheat day.

The person who needs to diet is someone who is obese.

A person who is obese is someone who eats a lot of fattening foods.

I like the taste of foods that make me gain weight, or I'm just used to buying food.

I continued to eat foods that make me gain weight because it was enjoyable or convenient for some reason.

Continuing that lifestyle has led to obesity.

To diet, you need to change your lifestyle like this.

I feel discomfort during that process.

This discomfort causes stress.

When stressful situations persist, I start to feel like giving up on my diet.

To prevent this, there is a suggestion that a cheat day is necessary.

So, to put it simply,

When you're on a diet, it can be stressful and frustrating.

Eating delicious food on a cheat day relieves stress.

It means that when stress is relieved, it is possible to continue dieting.

However, there is a problem with doing it that way.

First, it is possible to relieve stress through a cheat day.

In fact, eating spicy food relieves stress.

Eating sweet foods makes me feel happy.

However, when a person repeats a certain behavior, they learn that behavior.

If you repeatedly relieve stress by eating food, that also becomes a learned behavior.

In that case, when stress builds up, there is an increase in the desire to eat.

This is the problem.

This is something that has been repeated multiple times in other videos.

The reason we become obese is due to overeating, which is consuming more food than necessary.

However, all living beings, including humans, have the ability to regulate the amount of food they need.

When you need food, you feel hungry, and when you don't need food, you feel full.

In fact, when the body needs food, a hormone called ghrelin is released, which makes us feel hungry.

When you eat food, a hormone called leptin is released, which makes you feel full.

So in a normal state, you don't gain weight from the food you eat just because you're hungry.

The problem is that processed refined foods disrupt the hormonal system like that.

It means creating a false hunger even though there is no need for food.

If you eat based on this false hunger, you're eating when you don't actually need food, which leads to overeating.

If this overeating continues, it will lead to weight gain and obesity.

However, there is also the same issue with appetite that arises from stress.

I want to eat not because I need food, but because I want to eat to relieve stress.

Eating according to such desires leads to overeating, as you consume food even when you don't need it.

If this continues to happen, you will gradually gain weight.

So when stress builds up, relieving it with food becomes a habit that leads to obesity.

Using cheat days to relieve stress while dieting is a training that encourages the development of such habits.

So I'm intentionally trying to develop a habit of gaining weight.

Of course, it's not good for dieting.

However, it's not like I have cheat days often; I only have them once a week or once every two weeks.

That alone doesn't make you obese, right?

Yes, that's right. During the period of dieting, that is correct.

The problem comes after the diet is over.

Just a moment, if the diet is over, there’s no stress from dieting.

Then, of course, there are no cheating days.

Yes, that's right.

However, the habit of relieving stress through food remains in the body.

I have been continuously training my body while on a diet.

And the factors of stress are not limited to just dieting.

There is also stress due to academics.

There is also stress due to work.

There is also stress related to money.

There is also stress related to interpersonal relationships.

We experience stress from various issues, not just from dieting.

No matter how happy a person may seem, everyone has their own worries, and stress arises from them.

If you have a habit of relieving stress with food,

I tend to try to solve that kind of stress with food.

In reality, quite a few people relieve the stress they receive at work by enjoying delicious food as a late-night snack.

Eating late-night snacks like that leads to obesity.

So what do we do?

First, you need to find ways to relieve stress that are not related to food.

Meditating, taking a walk, napping, singing, or playing games.

There are many methods, and the effective approach can vary from person to person.

You need to find the method that works best for you on your own.

And there is one very important thing.

We need to change our perception of stress.

Just changing your perception of stress can reduce chronic stress and help with dieting.

I made a video about this before.

I will include the link to the related video at the end.

However, the stress from dieting is stress that comes from food.

I don't think meditation or walking will relieve that stress.

Yes, that's right.

The stress caused by a low-calorie diet is due to the fact that it is low in calories.

If you don't fill your calories, you will continue to experience stress.

So I do need to have a cheating day to relieve that stress.

But do I really have to follow a low-calorie diet and stress myself out while trying to lose weight?

There is no need to do that. You can still lose weight without doing it that way.

So, stress arises from dieting.

To relieve that stress, you need to have a cheat day.

Not this.

If you diet in a way that is stress-free from the beginning, it means that you won't need cheat days.

In the next video, let's talk about a stress-free diet.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

On the left, there will be a video about stress awareness that helps reduce chronic stress.

On the right, I will have the next video, the fifth part of Cheating Day, displayed.

If the video on the right is not part 5 of the cheat day, please wait a few more days.
