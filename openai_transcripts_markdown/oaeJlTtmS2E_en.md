Hello, this is pkang.

This is the fifth video about cellulite, as there were questions about cellulite in the comments.

I think this will be the last video on cellulite.

The link to the previous video is displayed in the upper right.

If you're curious about the video in front, you can click to watch it.

Since there is a lot of content that continues from the previous video, it would be better to watch the earlier video first.

In the previous video, we discussed the causes of cellulite formation in relation to obesity, normal weight, and underweight.

In this video, we will talk about cellulite caused by the food we eat.

Food that has undergone processing and deviated from its original form is called refined food.

Food that has not undergone processing is referred to as unrefined food, which is closer to the original form of the food.

Sugar made by extracting, filtering, and boiling sugarcane.

Flour made by grinding wheat.

White rice, made by peeling the skin off brown rice, is a typical refined food.

Refined foods have undergone processing, making it easy to consume large quantities.

It has the characteristic of being very quick to digest and absorb when eaten.

Due to this characteristic, consuming refined foods frequently can lead to metabolic disturbances in the body.

Because digestion and absorption happen too quickly, the body experiences confusion.

Such hormonal confusion can lead to the formation of cellulite.

Alternatively, there can be an increase in appetite due to false hunger.

The process by which processed foods create false hunger and lead to increased food consumption is as follows.

I explained it in detail in a video I made before.

The video link is available in the top right corner, so if you're curious, you can click on it to watch.

Cellulite caused by refined foods will disappear if you reduce your intake of refined foods.

However, simply reducing food intake would mean starving.

Fasting will lead to a decrease in muscle mass.

Then, due to the reasons mentioned in the previous video, cellulite forms.

It's not that I'm not eating food.

You need to change the types of food you eat from refined foods to unrefined foods.

The term "unrefined food" often brings to mind the idea of tasteless food.

You can think of it as unprocessed food.

For example, processed meats like sausages and ham, which are made by grinding or chopping meat and then re-forming it, are different from...

You can just eat the meat without cooking or chopping it.

Reduce the intake of sugar, which goes through many processing steps such as squeezing, filtering, and boiling sugarcane.

Brown rice with its husk is better than white rice that has been processed to remove the husk.

In the case of vegetables or fruits, unprocessed fresh vegetables and fresh fruits are better than juiced or dried versions.

When we talk about this, there are so many types of food.

Many people ask about various types of food.

Is this food okay? Is that food okay? They are asking like this.

I can't answer all of this one by one.

Some foods make you gain weight when you eat them.

Some foods can actually help you lose weight when you eat them.

So, there is a way to distinguish whether the food I eat helps my diet or not.

And there is a video that explains the method of distinction in detail.

There is a video link on the right side, so if you're curious about the content of the video, you can click to watch it.

If you refer to that video and have meals with unrefined foods,

You can significantly reduce cellulite caused by processed foods.

So far, we have looked at various cases of how cellulite forms.

The causes are varied, but the solutions are the same, right?

Because I wanted to explain comfortably and help with understanding, I divided the explanation to aid comprehension.

The truth is that all of this is connected as one.

So most people are likely experiencing cellulite due to a combination of two or more causes.

To explain this in detail,

If there is a lack of muscle mass, the strength of fluid circulation is weak, and inflammation easily occurs in the muscles.

And when body fat accumulates, it tends to accumulate primarily as subcutaneous fat.

In this way, fluid circulation disorders, inflammation of the muscles, and inflammation of the subcutaneous fat work together to create cellulite.

In other words,

If I exercise and increase my muscle mass, the strength of my fluid circulation will become stronger.

The muscle's recovery ability is good, which leads to less inflammation, and as the amount of subcutaneous fat decreases, cellulite disappears.

However, when the amount of food intake is insufficient, it is difficult to exercise because the body lacks strength.

Even if you force yourself to exercise, the lack of nutrients needed to build muscle means that your muscle mass does not increase easily.

So, you need to exercise while eating enough food.

If the food consumed at this time is refined food, there is a problem of increased body fat.

When the amount of subcutaneous fat increases, inflammation of the subcutaneous fat can lead to the formation of cellulite.

So, while having enough meals, you should eat unrefined foods instead of refined foods.

If you think about it this way, everything is actually connected.

Ultimately, regardless of whether I am obese, of normal weight, or underweight, it doesn't matter what kind of lifestyle I am living.

If I have cellulite on my body and want to reduce it,

If you eat enough unrefined foods and build muscle through exercise,

Anyone can completely get rid of cellulite.

Sounds plausible, right?
