This is the sixth video about dieting for age-related weight gain.

In the last video, one of the reasons for gaining weight as we age is the decrease in growth hormone.

To lose age-related weight, it was said that we need to increase the secretion of growth hormones.

To increase the secretion of growth hormone, it is necessary to activate autophagy.

When autophagy is activated, it has the effect of rejuvenating or slowing down aging.

In this video, I would like to talk about meal quantity and autophagy.

The amount of food we eat can be broadly categorized into three types.

Eating too much.

Eating too little.

Eating in moderation

First, when you eat too much, autophagy is not activated.

This is because autophagy itself is a kind of conservation response.

The human body is made up entirely of cells.

It was said that this cell is created and over time, it develops problems with its function.

Cells that have developed functional problems like this are referred to as senescent cells.

The increase in such aging cells leads to a decline in the overall function of the body, which is what aging is.

So our body tries to reduce the number of these aging cells.

The most basic method is to eliminate aging cells through apoptosis and create new cells through cell division.

However, there is also a method of recycling existing cells without creating new ones.

That's autophagy.

It's not about eliminating aging cells.

Aging cells eat and recycle themselves to become healthy cells again.

The important part here is recycling.

We recycle in our daily lives, but what is the purpose of recycling?

It is to save energy.

In order for autophagy, which recycles cells, to be activated,

It should be a situation where energy needs to be saved.

However, a situation where one eats too much food is not a situation where energy needs to be conserved.

I am in a situation where I have an abundance of energy because I am getting a lot of energy from various foods.

So in this situation, the autophagy, which is a conserving response, is suppressed.

In that case, if you hardly eat and become very low on energy, autophagy would be most active, right?

No, that's not the case.

If you eat insufficiently, you will lack energy, and it is true that a situation requiring conservation arises.

However, the way of saving is a bit different.

It is said that dieting with a low-calorie diet by eating insufficient food is not good.

Why wouldn't it be good?

This is because muscle mass decreases and basal metabolic rate lowers.

Because I eat insufficient food and lack energy, my body reduces the energy it consumes.

In this process, just like muscle mass decreases, the number of cells that make up the body also decreases.

So, cell death is actively occurring, which means that cells are being eliminated.

At this time, autophagy is suppressed.

Autophagy is when aging cells eat themselves and recycle to become healthy cells.

So, aging cells do change into healthy cells, but...

It is a mechanism that maintains the number of cells.

So, if there are 80 healthy cells and 20 aging cells,

If autophagy occurs here, it results in 100 healthy cells.

The number of cells remains the same.

However, right now, we are in a situation where we are trying to reduce the number of cells to decrease the energy consumed.

So if there are 80 healthy cells and 20 aging cells,

I will eliminate these 20 aging cells through cell death.

In this case, only 80 healthy cells will remain.

So originally, there were 100 cells, and now it has decreased to 80.

The purpose itself is to reduce the number of cells in this way.

Autophagy is suppressed, and apoptosis is activated.

So, how should I eat to activate autophagy?

Rather than suppressing the saving response by eating too much, it's better to eat a smaller amount.

At the same time, rather than eating too little and lowering your metabolism, you should eat more.

Simply put, you should eat in moderation.

I know that eating in moderation is good, but I don't know how much is considered moderate.

How much should I eat?

First of all, since each person has a different body and lifestyle patterns, there is a difference in the amount of food needed.

So it's best to find out the right portion size that suits your body.

We talked about how to determine the right portion size for your body in Part 1 of the Satiety Series.

However, I've heard that other people say you should fast without eating food?

They say that fasting activates autophagy and stimulates the release of growth hormones...

The reason such stories have emerged is due to intermittent fasting.

Intermittent fasting can be simply expressed as

It is a dietary method that involves fasting for about 16 hours a day without eating.

16 hours feels very long, but it also includes sleep time.

In reality, it's a method of eating that reduces three meals a day to two.

If intermittent fasting is done correctly, it activates autophagy and stimulates the release of growth hormone, which is true.

However, while focusing too much on fasting in intermittent fasting,

Fasting activates autophagy and releases growth hormones. This is how one comes to think.

However, intermittent fasting is a method of eating where you fast intermittently.

We are eating too often and too much, which is causing various health problems, including obesity.

Let's intentionally have fasting periods without eating food, so we can eat moderately instead of overeating.

This is the purpose of intermittent fasting.

It's not just about eating less or starving; the goal is to eat moderately.

So just as the fasting time is important, it is also important to eat during meal times.

However, by focusing too much on fasting,

Confusing intermittent fasting with fasting, one might think that fasting has the same effects.

It's not about fasting for 16 hours every day.

Isn't it better to fast for 18 or 20 hours every day?

This is how misunderstandings arise.

So if you eat too much, you gain weight.

To diet, you need to eat moderately by reducing the amount you eat without overeating.

When I heard this story

The key point of this story is that one should eat in moderation.

But does reducing the amount you eat lead to weight loss?

So, if you don't eat food at all and starve, would that be the best way to lose weight?

It's the same as thinking this way.

However, that's not actually the case.

And if fasting without eating food leads to more active autophagy and better health, then...

People in impoverished countries who do not eat properly should be the youngest-looking and healthiest in the world.

But that's not the case, is it?

So, the more you fast, it doesn't necessarily mean that autophagy becomes more active.

You need to be able to distinguish between intermittent fasting and fasting.

Intermittent fasting used to generate a lot of questions, so I created a series of related videos.

I will make sure to provide the series link at the top right.

As we age, we tend to gain weight, and that makes dieting increasingly difficult.

Getting older is already sad, and on top of that, I'm gaining weight, which makes me feel even more frustrated.

I hope you can refer to this series of videos to lose some age-related weight, become younger, and slow down aging.
