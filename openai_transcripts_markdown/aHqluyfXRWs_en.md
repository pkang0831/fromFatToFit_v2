The topic of this video is between intermittent fasting and three meals a day.

I will talk about which is better for dieting.

Recently, I would like you to leave a question in the comments...

In your opinion, between intermittent fasting and three meals a day,

You left a question asking which is better for dieting.

This is a response video where I share my thoughts on that.

First of all, what is intermittent fasting...

I think everyone knows this, but there might be some who don't.

Intermittent fasting refers to having periods during the day when you do not eat food for a certain amount of time.

It is common knowledge that prolonged fasting without food is not good for health.

If you intentionally adjust the time, this kind of fasting won't become prolonged.

It can help with dieting and be good for your health.

The most well-known methods in the country are the 16:8 and 5:2 intermittent fasting.

The 16:8 intermittent fasting involves fasting for 16 hours a day without eating.

Eight hours a day refers to the time spent eating.

When you say 16 hours, it can feel very long.

It's not that long because it includes sleep time.

The most common pattern is not having breakfast.

Have lunch at 12 o'clock and then have dinner between 7 and 8 o'clock.

So the last meal ended at 8 PM.

If you fast from this time until noon the next day, you will not eat any food.

That time totals about 16 hours, including sleep time.

Maintaining this eating pattern throughout the week is known as the 16:8 intermittent fasting.

The 5:2 intermittent fasting involves eating normally for 5 days of the week and fasting for 24 hours on 2 days.

Since this is also said to be 24 hours, it can feel quite long.

It’s not that long because it includes sleep time.

If you have decided to fast on Tuesdays and Thursdays,

On Monday morning, have breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The time when dinner on Monday evening is finished. For example, if dinner ends at 8 PM.

This refers to having a fasting period of 24 hours, during which no food is consumed, starting from this time until 8 PM on Tuesday.

The argument for why eating three meals a day is good for dieting is based on the following reasons:

If we do not eat our meals regularly and skip them in between or eat irregularly,

The body feels anxious because it doesn't know when food will come in.

So, in preparation for any potential emergencies, I try to store as much of the food I eat as fat as possible.

Having regular meals every day helps prevent the accumulation of fat, which is beneficial for dieting.

The argument for intermittent fasting is that it is easy to access food, leading to overeating.

Therefore, intentionally having a fasting period where you do not eat food.

The claim is that you can reduce unnecessary food intake and lose weight.

In my case, I am following a low-carb, high-fat diet called the ketogenic diet.

Both sides have a point to some extent.

The most important thing in the long-term diet is to reduce the intake of refined carbohydrates, right?

White rice made by removing the husk from rice, and flour made by grinding wheat.

Sugar made by squeezing, filtering, and boiling sugarcane.

Such refined carbohydrates lead to increased food intake, which is a cause of obesity.

The basic concept of the long-term diet is to reduce the intake of refined carbohydrates.

The interesting thing is that when you eat without consuming refined carbohydrates,

It has the characteristic of maintaining a feeling of fullness for 6 to 7 hours.

In that case, I will have my first meal and then have my second meal 6 to 7 hours later.

After about 6 to 7 hours, when I was planning to have my third meal, I realized that I was actually sleeping.

So there are times when you unintentionally end up fasting for 16 hours.

I didn't intend to practice intermittent fasting, but...

This is a case where a long-term diet has turned into intermittent fasting.

There are side effects to intermittent fasting. There is a risk of binge eating, especially for those who feel they have failed.

In most cases, refined carbohydrates are included in the diet.

I tried to stick to my fasting schedule, but I ended up eating a lot of refined carbohydrates during meal times.

As a result, the desire for food grew stronger, leading to binge eating.

On the contrary, intermittent fasting is good for health, according to those who promote it as beneficial for dieting.

The composition of the diet excludes refined carbohydrates.

However, among those who advocate for intermittent fasting, there are some who say that you can eat anything.

However, in this case, there is a condition that you must restrict calories.

Because of the calorie restriction, the intake of refined carbohydrates decreases.

Then, based on what we've discussed so far, between three meals a day and intermittent fasting,

It seems like you are trying to say that intermittent fasting is better, but that's not the case.

We don't live the exact same day every single day, do we?

Some days, there are not many tasks, so it's a relaxed day.

Some days I have to work late, and there are days when I feel a lot of stress.

There are days when I feel good, and there are days when I feel bad.

There are days when I am healthy and have no issues, but there are also days when I am injured and use a lot of energy to recover.

Every day is a different day, and the energy we expend changes, as do the nutrients we need.

Ignoring all of this, maintaining the same number of meals and the same fasting duration is

There is indeed a question of whether it is a good rule for dieting.

People understand these rules, but our bodies do not know them.

From the body's perspective, "I used a lot of energy working overtime yesterday."

So I said that I should eat a lot this morning.

I'm sorry, but if you say it's fasting time and don't provide food, it would be quite confusing, right?

On the contrary, today was very relaxed, so I didn't expend much energy.

So I said, "I don't need food."

If you force yourself to eat three meals a day, it can also be quite overwhelming.

Rather than saying that three meals a day are good and intermittent fasting is better,

In my case, when there is no intake of refined carbohydrates,

I think it's best to eat when you're hungry and not eat when you're not.

In my case, I usually eat two meals a day.

There are days when I eat two meals and the fasting period exceeds 16 hours. Those are the days I practice intermittent fasting.

However, there are days when it’s less than 16 hours. There are days with intervals of 14 hours or 12 hours, and some days I eat three meals, while on other days I only eat one meal or don’t eat at all.

This seems to indicate that meals are being eaten very irregularly.

Isn't that bad for your health? You can do it, though.

From my perspective, I think it's regular.

As mentioned earlier, the number of meals and fasting duration are

We know, but our bodies don't.

On the contrary, my eating pattern may seem irregular to others, but...

The body appears to be in balance.

It consumes a lot of energy, so a lot of energy is needed. Then, you need to eat a lot of food.

It consumes little energy, so there is no need for energy consumption. Then, let's eat less food.

By doing this, you won't eat an excessive amount of food unnecessarily.

In intermittent fasting, it is possible to avoid the accumulation of body fat from leftover food.

The body needs energy, but there are no cases where food is not consumed.

In three meals a day, there is no accumulation of body fat due to the hunger response.

So I prefer three meals a day rather than intermittent fasting.

Eating when you are hungry and not eating when you are not hungry, depending on your body's condition, is...

Isn't it possible to take advantage of both sides?

Sounds plausible, right?
