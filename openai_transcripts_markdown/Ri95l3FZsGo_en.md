No matter how much I exercise, I can't lose the fat on my arms and back - Upper Body Obesity Part 2.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the second video on upper body obesity.

In the last video, upper body obesity refers to having a lot of subcutaneous fat in the upper body.

It was said that exercise is more effective than diet for reducing this body fat.

Even though I am exercising hard, there are times when I still have upper body obesity.

This refers to a situation where there is an issue with the area of the body being exercised or a problem with the type of exercise being performed.

In this video, let's talk about upper body obesity and exercise.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it is better to watch them in order.

The link to the previous video is displayed in the top right.

If you haven't watched the previous video, you can click and watch them in order.

When a person who has never exercised starts working out for the purpose of dieting.

I mainly focus on exercises that utilize the lower body.

Treadmills and cycles are also exercises that primarily utilize the lower body.

The stair climbing exercise that many people have been doing since it was featured on the broadcast is also a workout that utilizes the lower body.

As I mentioned in the last video,

To reduce upper body subcutaneous fat, it is necessary to increase upper body muscle mass and generate heat by using the muscles.

Since I am focusing on lower body exercises, only the subcutaneous fat in my lower body is decreasing, while the subcutaneous fat in my upper body is not.

So, should I not do lower body exercises and focus on upper body exercises instead?

No, that's not it.

It means that one should recognize the need to do upper body exercises, and that both upper and lower body exercises should be performed.

When people have to do something they don't want to do, they tend to choose the relatively easier tasks within that work.

If I have to study something I don't want to, it's easier to study the subject I'm good at.

So when I study, I only focus on the subjects I am good at.

The subjects I struggle with, I sometimes just give up on.

The upper body has less muscle mass compared to the lower body, and since the upper body muscles are not used much in daily activities,

I try to exercise, but it doesn't go well.

On the other hand, the lower body has more muscle mass compared to the upper body, and since we use our lower body muscles a lot while walking around,

Even if someone is not good at exercising, they can still do it to some extent.

Because of this, lower body exercises are easier than upper body exercises.

So, unconsciously, I tend to choose exercises that focus on the lower body.

There is nothing wrong with doing lower body exercises itself, but...

I didn't want to do upper body exercises, so I focused hard on lower body workouts instead.

Anyway, since I exercised, don't think that it will come off on its own.

The subjects I gave up on and didn't study seem to yield no grades.

If I don't do upper body exercises, the upper body fat doesn't come off easily.

I'm worried because I have too much fat on my arms.

If I do upper body exercises and increase the muscle mass in my arms, won't my arms become too thick?

They say that no matter how hard women exercise, they don't get bulky.

I really get bulkier because I exercise.

In reality, quite a few women avoid exercising for this reason.

Women find it more difficult to build muscle than men.

Even for men, who find it easier to build muscle compared to women,

I'm not worried about my arms getting too thick because I'm gaining a lot of muscle from exercising.

It is strange for a woman who finds it difficult to build muscle to worry about getting bulky because of muscle.

There is such a story, and while it is somewhat true,

Many women have the experience of actually becoming thicker.

This phenomenon occurs because men and women have different physical structures from the beginning.

There have been so many questions about this that I have already created a response video.

They say that no matter how much women exercise, their arms and legs do not become thick due to muscle.

Why do you actually get thicker when you exercise?

And since we talked in detail about how to solve that problem,

So, if I do arm exercises to increase my arm muscle mass, does that mean I'll lose fat in my arms?

However, I've heard that working hard on arm exercises doesn't necessarily lead to losing arm fat.

In the beginning of the video, it was mentioned that there are two reasons why body fat does not decrease from an exercise perspective.

The first issue is related to the area of the body being exercised, and the second issue is related to the type of exercise being performed.

It is true that general exercise for about 1 to 2 hours a day does not effectively reduce subcutaneous fat.

The original purpose of this exercise is to stimulate the muscles in order to increase muscle mass.

Just because muscle mass increases doesn't mean that body fat will immediately decrease.

Let's think about the content of the last video once again.

Generate heat by using muscles.

The heat escapes from the body, but it has to be hindered by subcutaneous fat in order to do so.

So, I need to increase my muscle mass.

The reason to increase muscle mass is to generate a lot of heat by using that muscle.

So the purpose of the exercise we do for about 1 to 2 hours is to build muscle.

If we talk based on that kind of exercise, it's true that doing arm workouts doesn't necessarily lead to losing fat in the arms.

To lose arm fat, you need to utilize the enlarged arm muscles to generate heat.

The type of exercise that generates heat is called knit exercise.

What is knit exercise?

The concept of knit exercise was discussed in detail in another video.

The link is going out at the top right.

If you are not familiar with knit exercises, you can click here to learn more.

I just watched a knit workout video.

I understand what knit exercise is and why it helps reduce body fat, but...

In that video, they explained using examples of abdominal exercises and thigh exercises.

What kind of knit exercises should I do to lose arm and back fat?

In the next video, I will talk about knit exercises to reduce arm and back fat.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not about upper body obesity, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making it.
