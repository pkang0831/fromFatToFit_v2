Foods made from powder make you gain weight!! What about tofu made from soybean powder?

Hello, this is pkang.

There is a video I made recently about how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight.

One of the methods mentioned in the video is about processing that speeds up digestion and absorption.

The reason we become obese is that too many nutrients enter our bodies.

In the past, I thought that eating a lot of food meant that many nutrients were coming in.

I thought I should reduce the amount of food I eat or not eat at all, but

Eating less or not eating at all is difficult to maintain for a long time due to hunger.

There was a problem that the metabolism slows down, making it easier to gain weight.

Recently, there has been growing interest in changing the types of food we eat.

If you eat foods that are rich in nutrients and are quickly digested and absorbed,

It's a problem because too many nutrients are coming in.

Eating foods that are high in nutrients but slow to digest and absorb

You eat foods that are quickly digested and absorbed, but not very rich in nutrients.

So, if there are 100 nutrients, only 50% may be absorbed due to slow digestion and absorption.

Since it is quickly digested and absorbed, it is 100% absorbed, but if you eat food that has a nutrient content of 50, then...

In reality, the nutrients absorbed by the body are 50, which is why dieting works.

Foods that are referred to as diet foods meet these conditions.

However, processing foods that are digested and absorbed slowly to make them digest and absorb quickly or

When food that is low in nutrients is processed to become higher in nutrients, it becomes food that can lead to weight gain.

In fact, when food is ground, chopped, or crushed, digestion and absorption become faster.

Because of this, rice cakes made from ground white rice flour and bread and noodles made from ground wheat flour are

It becomes food that is more fattening than white rice.

However, many similar questions have been posted in the comments of this video.

Mr. pkang, tofu is made by grinding soybeans. Does that mean tofu is a fattening food?

If you chew glutinous rice for a long time, it completely turns into a paste, like when it's blended in a mixer.

Does eating brown rice like this make it a fattening food?

So, does that mean it's better for dieting to swallow food without chewing as much as possible?

That's an interesting question, isn't it?

In this video, I will talk about this question.

First, let me talk about tofu.

Tofu is not a fattening food.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video, there are two conditions for foods that make you gain weight.

The first is that the nutrient content must be high, and the second is that digestion and absorption should be quick.

Tofu is made by grinding soybeans, and grinding them speeds up digestion and absorption.

It is true that tofu is a food that is quickly digested and absorbed. However, it does not have a high nutrient content.

You can understand the reason by looking at the process of making tofu.

To make tofu, soak the beans in water.

After grinding the soaked beans to make soybean milk, you need to add coagulant to solidify it.

In the process of soaking the beans in water and adding the alkaline solution, a large amount of water is used.

This water causes a decrease in nutrient content.

Adding water doesn't eliminate the nutrients, so why does the nutrient content decrease?

If you think about adding water to a soup that is salty because it has a lot of salt, it becomes less salty.

Just because you add water doesn't mean the salt that was already there disappears.

However, as you add water, the overall volume increases, so the salt content per 100g decreases, making it taste bland.

In fact, the ingredient that makes up tofu is soybeans.

It is a food with a high nutrient content, containing 30g of carbohydrates and 30g of protein per 100g.

However, tofu contains 2g of carbohydrates and 8g of protein per 100g, making it a food with low nutrient content.

So, tofu is made by grinding soybeans, which means it is a food that is quickly digested and absorbed.

Because it has a high water content, it has a low nutrient density, so it is not a fattening food.

Second brown rice

To answer the question about hyunmi,

It is necessary to talk about the brown rice controversy that happened in the past.

In the past, there was a claim that brown rice is rich in good nutrients, and that eating brown rice leads to better health.

It is true that brown rice contains many beneficial nutrients.

However, there were also people who made opposing arguments to this claim.

It is true that brown rice contains many beneficial nutrients.

However, brown rice contains husks, dietary fiber, and phytic acid that hinder digestion and absorption.

This prevents the nutrients in brown rice from being properly absorbed by the body.

Therefore, the claim is that eating brown rice cannot be said to be good for health.

The interesting thing about this debate is

I am not denying the claim that there are many beneficial nutrients in brown rice.

It is true that there are many good nutrients, but the part I argued against is that they are not absorbed by the body.

And one more interesting point is that the nutrients in brown rice are not actually well absorbed.

The reason brown rice is considered a diet food in the first place is...

It's because the shell, dietary fiber, and phytic acid make digestion and absorption difficult.

Then Hyunmi raises a counterargument regarding the health benefits.

It is true that the husk, dietary fiber, and phytic acid in brown rice can interfere with digestion and absorption.

However, if you change the way you eat brown rice, that problem can be solved.

When you germinate brown rice to make sprouted brown rice, most of the components that hinder digestion and absorption disappear.

You can eat brown rice by sprouting it.

If you chew a spoonful of brown rice more than 50 times for a long time,

As it mixes with saliva that helps digestion and transforms into a porridge-like consistency, the skin peels off.

It means that it changes to facilitate better digestion and absorption.

In fact, the components in seeds like brown rice that hinder digestion and absorption are

Because it is a means of resistance when seeds are eaten by predators.

Most seeds disappear once they germinate.

The sprouted seedling needs to absorb nutrients to grow, so it actually changes to make digestion and absorption easier.

So, germinated brown rice is also used in meals for patients.

Chewing brown rice for a long time to break it down into smaller pieces and mixing it with saliva for an extended period is also effective.

Saliva initially has the effect of aiding digestion and absorption.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video, shredding, chopping, and grinding make digestion and absorption faster.

So these methods are indeed ways to help absorb the good nutrients from brown rice effectively.

However, saying that it has many good nutrients and is good for health is not the same as saying it is good for dieting.

Obesity is bad for health, but dieting is good for health.

Aren't foods that are good for dieting also good for health?

It is possible to interpret it that way, but from a nutritional perspective, it is not.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video,

Obesity is a symptom of excessive nutrient intake.

Therefore, the purpose of dieting is to reduce the nutrients that enter the body.

Reduce the amount of food you eat or consume foods that are low in nutrients.

Instead of eating white rice, which is easily digested and absorbed, we eat brown rice, which is not easily digested and absorbed.

So, the method is to eat sprouted brown rice or to chew it for a long time.

It is a way to effectively absorb the good nutrients from brown rice, but...

It means that it is not a method that has a dieting effect because nutrients are well absorbed.

The reason brown rice has a weight loss effect in the first place is that it is not easily digested.

So, if you chew brown rice for a long time, does it become a fattening food? Yes, it does.

So, does that mean that not chewing much and just swallowing food is good for dieting?

That's not the case.

When it is said that certain behaviors lead to obesity

Many people mistakenly believe that doing the exact opposite of that behavior is the best for dieting.

That's not actually the case.

For example, when it is said that eating too much food can lead to obesity,

So, is it best for dieting to eat as little as possible or to not eat at all and starve?

Of course, that's not the case.

Fasting or following a low-calorie diet can make your body prone to gaining weight, which hinders your dieting efforts.

If you eat too much food, you will become obese.

You just need to avoid overeating.

Similarly, if chewing brown rice for too long is a problem, then simply don't chew it for too long.

Swallowing food without chewing is very difficult in itself.

It puts a significant burden on the digestive system, which can lead to other health issues.

And if health issues arise in the digestive system, it can negatively affect dieting as well.

I will summarize.

When food is chopped, ground, or crushed, it becomes easier to digest and absorb, leading to weight gain.

Tofu, which is made by grinding soybeans, is not a fattening food because a lot of water is added.

In the case of brown rice, it is true that chewing it for too long can reduce its diet effect.

However, if you swallow it without chewing as much as possible, that can also be a problem.

You can just chew it moderately and normally.

According to what you said, sweet potatoes are a food that helps with weight loss, right?

However, sweet potatoes are fattening foods. What is the YouTube video that claims eating sweet potatoes makes you gain weight?

In the next video, I will talk about that question.

There are currently two videos on the screen. Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not a new release, we are still in the process of making it, so please wait a few days.

I will return with another video. Thank you.
