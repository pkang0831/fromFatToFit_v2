The topic of this video is brown rice.

Brown rice is what we call rice that has not had its husk removed.

There are many conflicting claims about brown rice.

Brown rice is said to be rich in nutrients and effective for dieting, which is claimed to be good for health.

On the contrary, there are claims that brown rice contains toxins and is not good for health.

There is a claim that you can simply eat brown rice as it is.

There is also a claim that when eating brown rice, it should be chewed thoroughly at least 50 times.

If you soak glutinous rice for 12 to 24 hours, it will germinate.

There is also a claim that one should eat sprouted brown rice that has been germinated in this way.

There are many conflicting arguments, so it can be confusing to know what is right and what should be done.

I will explain why this is happening.

To obtain nutrients from food, a process of digestion and absorption in the digestive system is necessary.

Digestion in the digestive system requires energy and takes time while food is being digested.

Because brown rice has an outer shell, it can only digest the contents after melting the outer shell.

The shell consumes more energy to digest than white rice and takes a longer time to digest.

The skin of brown rice contains a component called phytic acid.

Phytic acid interferes with digestion and binds to nutrients, leading to their excretion.

It has the characteristic of preventing the absorption of nutrients.

When eating brown rice, the time and energy required for digestion and absorption are greater compared to eating white rice.

The nutrients that can be obtained are reduced due to phytic acid.

If we compare the same amount of brown rice and white rice,

Brown rice has a less fattening effect compared to white rice.

If interpreted positively, the effects of the husk of brown rice and phytic acid can be seen as beneficial for dieting.

If the effects of the husk of brown rice and phytic acid are interpreted negatively, the opposite result will occur.

The skin of brown rice is difficult to digest, so it can have a negative impact on people with weak digestive abilities.

Phytic acid combines with other nutrients and is excreted from the body, which prevents the absorption of those nutrients.

Not only do the nutrients in brown rice interfere with the absorption of other foods' nutrients.

So, when consuming phytic acid in excess,

It can block the absorption of other nutrients such as iron, calcium, zinc, and manganese, leading to diseases including osteoporosis.

In addition to this, there are also discussions about pesticide residues on the skin and arsenic.

I will cover that in another video.

In other words, it's not that brown rice has good points and bad points.

The characteristics and benefits of brown rice are singular.

The difference arises from whether you interpret this positively or negatively.

Then why do differences arise in interpretation?

It is because the situation of eating glutinous rice is set differently.

I will categorize the meal portions into three levels: +1, 0, and -1.

+1 refers to cases of overeating nutrients.

0 is when one eats a moderate amount of nutrients.

-1 indicates a case of insufficient nutrition.

The side that claims brown rice is helpful for dieting suggests that it is rich in nutrients.

In modern times, food is easily accessible.

Most people are overeating due to excessive nutrition.

At this time, if you switch from white rice to brown rice,

The skin of brown rice slows down digestion.

Excess nutrients due to phytic acid are reduced to appropriate levels.

Therefore, it means that there is a dieting effect.

On the contrary, the stance that one should not eat brown rice while dieting is

We set up a situation where nutrients are lacking.

In an era where food is easily accessible, it's a bit puzzling to hear about nutrient deficiencies.

Most people eat brown rice for the purpose of dieting, right?

People who are dieting intentionally try to reduce the amount of food they consume.

As the amount of food consumed decreases, the nutrients entering the body also decrease.

In situations where nutrients are reduced and lacking, the phytic acid in brown rice can have a negative impact.

I will summarize.

I am currently reducing my food intake for the purpose of dieting, so if the nutrients coming into my body are decreased...

Eating brown rice is not a good choice.

On the contrary, if you are consuming sufficient nutrients from fruits and vegetables, then...

Eating brown rice can be helpful for dieting.

Sounds plausible, right?

As I mentioned at the beginning of the video, there are many stories about brown rice beyond just dieting.

There are claims that phytic acid itself is toxic.

There are also concerns about pesticides and arsenic in the skin of brown rice.

There are various ways to eat brown rice.

I will create a series of videos on hyunmi and address each one individually.

In the next video, we will talk about brown rice and health.
