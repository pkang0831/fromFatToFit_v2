Hello, this is pkang.

The topic of this video is how thin people can gain weight.

Most of the videos I have uploaded so far are about how to diet.

There may be many subscribers who are not interested in how thin people can gain weight.

I want to be the type of person who is on a diet, but my body type is such that I don't gain weight no matter how much I eat.

I think it would be interesting to explore why thin people don't gain weight.

First of all, for someone who is struggling with being too thin, they often hear the following comments very easily.

What's so difficult about gaining weight? If you eat a lot of things like ramen, bread, and chicken, you'll gain weight.

I heard there are supplements called gainers that help you gain weight. Can't you just take that?

If you eat less and move more, you won't gain weight. If you eat a lot and move little, you'll gain weight.

You want to gain weight, right? Exercising makes you lose weight, so what kind of exercise are you talking about?

First, gain some weight and then exercise. When you gain weight, your muscles will naturally grow.

However, from the perspective of someone who is thin, these kinds of stories can often be quite frustrating.

If I talk about why I feel frustrated,

A thin person is not only someone who lacks body fat but also someone who has very low muscle mass.

If you gain weight by eating foods like ramen, bread, and chicken, you will increase body fat while having a low muscle mass.

Men tend to accumulate body fat primarily as visceral fat.

When there is a lack of muscle mass and visceral fat increases,

You end up with a spider-like body where your limbs are thin but your belly sticks out.

Women tend to accumulate body fat primarily in the subcutaneous layer.

When there is a lack of muscle mass and only subcutaneous fat increases, the body becomes saggy and flabby.

Just because someone is thin, it doesn't mean that gaining weight is acceptable if it leads to that kind of appearance.

The meaning of wanting to gain weight is that my body looks too thin right now, which is not aesthetically pleasing.

I want to gain a little weight to have a nice, slim figure.

I don't want to become an ugly, fat body.

A gainer is a supplement designed to help you easily consume a large amount of fast-digesting and absorbing carbohydrates.

It retains the characteristics of refined carbohydrates.

So gaining weight with a gainer is similar to gaining weight with ramen, bread, and chicken.

This does not create the body that thin people desire either.

If you eat a lot and move little, you will gain weight.

However, among thin people, there are those who are thin because they eat little.

There are people who eat a lot but still don't gain weight.

Simply eating a lot does not necessarily mean that you will gain weight.

In the case of someone who is thin because they eat little, they try to make an effort to eat more.

The problem is that the reason for eating less in the first place is that there isn't much appetite.

Just like it's difficult to force ourselves to endure hunger when we are on a diet,

Forcing yourself to eat food you don't want to eat is also very difficult.

It's not an easy task.

However, there are times when I force myself to eat because I want to gain weight.

However, even if you eat like this, there are many cases where you don't gain weight.

There are many cases where people give up on eating because of stomach pain and diarrhea from forcing themselves to eat.

So this isn't really a helpful story either.

If you want to gain weight, you shouldn't exercise, and gaining weight will naturally increase your muscles.

First of all, the idea that you shouldn't exercise if you want to gain weight is

People who want to lose weight tend to exercise a lot when they are on a diet.

This is because a preconceived notion has developed that exercising leads to weight loss.

The reason for exercising is to build muscle.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video, thin people have very low muscle mass along with body fat.

Even thin people obviously need exercise.

The idea that muscles will automatically grow when you gain weight is...

This is about the discussion on weight and muscle that was featured in Part 1 of the lower body obesity video.

When body weight increases, muscles develop to support the heavier body and facilitate movement.

Such developed muscles

Muscles developed to support body weight are called weight-bearing muscles.

Severely obese individuals who weigh a lot because of this may have no experience with exercise at all.

Inbody tests can sometimes show high muscle mass.

So even if only body fat increases, if you gain weight, muscle mass will also increase.

This statement is not incorrect.

However, in order to increase muscle mass, a significant amount of body fat is actually necessary.

In this case, even if muscle mass increases, the stomach may protrude too much.

The flesh has become too loose and is sagging.

It means you can't have a pretty body.

If simply gaining weight would automatically result in a good-looking body, then there would be no reason for overweight people to go on a diet.

People who are overweight try to diet because they don't find their bodies attractive.

It's also a misconception that just increasing body fat will solve everything.

So, then... can't I just gain weight to build muscle, and then lose the fat afterwards?

I'm worried because I can't gain weight. Losing weight is really easy, you know.

Muscle mass refers to the muscles that have developed by continuously supporting heavy weight 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

If you lose weight, your body will become lighter, and that means you won't be using your muscle weight.

Unused muscle mass will decrease due to muscle loss.

If you really work hard at exercising, you might think that you can maintain it.

The average person can exercise for about 1 to 2 hours a day.

Skeletal muscle is developed through constant load from body weight without resting for 24 hours.

No matter how hard you exercise for 1 to 2 hours,

It cannot exceed the total load of weight-bearing muscles over a continuous 24-hour period.

So, you cannot maintain muscle mass through exercise alone.

Even if you follow a proper diet and exercise because of this, you cannot prevent the loss of muscle weight.

So, if you gain weight primarily through body fat, it is true that your muscle mass will increase as well.

If you gain weight like that, you'll end up with too much body fat, resulting in an unappealing physique.

If you reduce body fat because of this, your muscle weight will decrease, and your muscle mass will return to its original state.

So simply increasing body fat will not yield the desired results, no matter what you do.

So, what should a thin person do to gain weight?

There is a reason for not gaining weight, and if we address that reason, it should be fine.

The reasons for not gaining weight vary depending on the type of thin person.

There are people who eat very little and therefore do not gain weight.

There are people who eat a lot of food but still don't gain weight.

In the following video, I will talk about each one in order.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure to have it appear on the right video.

If the video on the right is not the second part of the video featuring a thin person.

I am still in the process of making the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

If you found this video helpful, please subscribe and like it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
