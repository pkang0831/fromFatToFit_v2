The topic of this video is the reasons for weight gain in cases of severe obesity.

This video is also a response to the questions that were posted in the comments.

If I read the questions from the comments,

I find pkang's theory understandable and plausible. However, have you ever been obese in your life?

If you're hungry, eat; if you're not hungry, don't eat. Theories like these about what's good for the body are really nice, but...

Fat people are always hungry, and they really like refined carbohydrates.

I know it's not good, but I can't control myself. I try to quit and keep trying, but I keep failing.

Even strong-willed people can crumble in front of food.

Please create useful information about severe obesity.

A question with this kind of content has come up, so I will talk about it.

If I were to answer the question, "Have you ever been obese?"

I started gaining weight since elementary school.

In high school, my weight exceeded 100 kg.

My maximum weight reached 110 kg.

If someone weighs over 100 kg, I think they would be tall.

My height is 168 cm, which is considered short for a man.

A body that is 168 cm tall and weighs 110 kg, if I exaggerate a little, is a body that can roll around.

It was not just general obesity, but severe super obesity.

I often feel the hunger mentioned in the question. I understand well that it is difficult to cut out refined carbohydrates.

However, you need to reduce refined carbohydrates.

Because we often think that the reason we become obese is due to frequently feeling hungry, which leads to overeating and ultimately obesity.

The reason we often feel hungry in the first place is due to refined carbohydrates.

If you don't eat refined carbohydrates, you don't feel hungry often, and you don't overeat, which prevents obesity.

It's not about forcing yourself to endure hunger when you want to eat.

I don't want to eat a lot of food in the first place, so I can diet without stress.

Then, how do refined carbohydrates trigger hunger?

Let's find out how to easily cut out refined carbohydrates that are hard to give up.

There are two reasons why eating refined carbohydrates makes you feel hungry more often.

The first reason is blood sugar fluctuations.

A state of low blood sugar is -1.

When blood sugar is within the normal range, it is 0.

I will classify a state of elevated blood sugar as +1.

When blood sugar is at -1, hunger is felt.

When you feel hungry, eating unrefined carbohydrates like fruits and vegetables...

Blood sugar has increased by one level and is now within the normal range (0).

Blood sugar refers to the concentration of glucose in the blood.

Glucose is used as energy in the brain and muscles.

When blood sugar levels rise, the available energy increases, which makes the brain feel happy and gives the muscles a sense of strength.

But what happens if you eat refined carbohydrates instead of unrefined carbohydrates when you get hungry?

Refined carbohydrates, as mentioned in other videos, have the characteristic of rapidly and significantly raising blood sugar levels.

So, the blood sugar level goes up to +1 instead of staying at 0.

A blood sugar level of +1 is higher than 0, so the brain becomes happier and the muscles become more energized.

The problem is that a +1 blood sugar level is too high.

Inflammation occurs in the blood vessel walls.

To prevent this, we store glucose in the blood as body fat to lower blood sugar levels.

Body fat has accumulated and blood sugar has dropped to zero.

A blood sugar level of 0 is within the normal range, so you should not feel hungry in this state.

However, it is within the normal range, but compared to +1, it has dropped one level.

Due to this drop, the muscles feel relatively weak, and the brain experiences feelings of unhappiness.

I dislike this feeling, so I want to raise my blood sugar by +1 again.

So they say that carbohydrates can have addictive symptoms.

Because they are not satisfied with the normal state (0) and want to move to the excess state (+1).

I feel hungry in order to reach a blood sugar level of +1, but this is "false hunger."

It's not a hunger caused by a lack of calories or energy in the body.

Hunger felt for the purpose of raising blood sugar.

When my body lacks energy and I feel hungry, I crave high-calorie, greasy foods.

False hunger aims to raise blood sugar levels, which is why there is a tendency to crave sweet foods.

And the bigger problem is that consuming sugary foods raises blood sugar levels, which can lead to inflammation in the blood vessel walls.

To prevent inflammation, glucose is stored as body fat, and blood sugar levels decrease.

When blood sugar levels drop, false hunger is felt again.

Because this process repeats, consuming refined carbohydrates leads to frequent feelings of hunger and an increase in body fat.

Sounds plausible, right?
