Does coffee raise blood sugar and cause diabetes? - Coffee and Diet Part 2

Drinking coffee can raise blood sugar levels, which may lead to diabetes.

Coffee does not raise blood sugar levels, so it can be consumed without concern, and drinking it regularly can lower the risk of developing diabetes.

There are conflicting stories about coffee and blood sugar.

As it has been revealed that refined carbohydrates can lead to increased blood sugar levels, which in turn can cause obesity,

Many people have come to believe that in order to diet, they should reduce their intake of foods that raise blood sugar levels.

Many people are curious about whether it's true that coffee raises blood sugar levels.

In this video, I will talk about this.

As mentioned in Part 1 of the video on coffee and dieting, it is true that drinking coffee raises blood sugar levels.

The caffeine in coffee keeps the body in an alert state.

In order to use a lot of energy in an awakened state, the amount of glucose in the blood increases.

It gets interesting from here.

Originally, when our blood sugar levels rise, insulin hormones are secreted.

This insulin lowers blood sugar levels.

However, in an awakened state, you intentionally raise your blood sugar levels to use a lot of energy, right?

So, insulin resistance increases to prevent blood sugar from dropping.

Diabetes occurs when insulin resistance increases, leading to a state where blood sugar does not decrease.

This leads to the conclusion that coffee raises blood sugar levels and is a cause of diabetes.

I've heard that insulin resistance is a cause of obesity and diabetes. So, is it correct to say that coffee is a cause of obesity and diabetes?

That's not the case.

The increased insulin resistance from coffee is merely a temporary symptom that occurs during a state of alertness.

When the state of awakening is released, insulin resistance decreases. In fact, sensitivity increases.

Statistics show that people who drink coffee regularly have a lower risk of developing diabetes.

There are two main arguments for why this happens.

The first argument is that coffee contains various components besides caffeine.

Caffeine raises blood sugar, but other components help with blood sugar regulation.

The second claim is that the response to insulin has become stronger.

The various components found in coffee are also present in other foods besides coffee.

It's not absolutely necessary to drink coffee, so I'll skip the first argument as it doesn't require any further explanation.

I will talk about the second argument.

All organs in the human body develop more as they are used.

An exercise that involves repeatedly contracting and relaxing the muscles is the most representative example of how muscles gradually develop.

When drinking coffee, the state of alertness increases insulin resistance.

After the state of awakening ends, through a repetition that enhances insulin sensitivity.

Just like muscles become stronger, the response to insulin also becomes stronger.

This is a claim that it lowers the risk of diabetes.

So, is it helpful for people with diabetes to drink coffee?

That's not the case.

For those who can manage their blood sugar levels on their own, coffee can be helpful.

A person who has lost the ability to regulate their blood sugar is someone with diabetes.

In the case of such a person, the elevated blood sugar levels that occurred during the state of arousal do not decrease even after the arousal has ended.

Rather, diabetes may worsen.

So, does drinking a lot of coffee help prevent diabetes and aid in dieting?

That's not the case.

Coffee does contain components that can help prevent diabetes, but it also has other ingredients, including caffeine.

If you consume these ingredients in excess, various side effects can occur.

As I mentioned earlier,

The components in coffee that help prevent diabetes are not exclusive to coffee; they can also be found in other foods.

Rather than drinking a lot of coffee,

It is better to drink coffee in moderation and eat other nutrient-rich foods together.

And unless we drink two cups of coffee at once, drinking a lot of coffee means drinking it often.

In order for the response to insulin to become stronger,

Both a state of high insulin resistance and a state of high insulin sensitivity need to occur.

If you drink coffee frequently at short intervals, it will only maintain a state of high insulin resistance.

It might actually not be good.

When talking about how regular exercise is good for health,

The term "regular" refers to consistently exercising for 1 to 2 hours a day.

It's not like I'm saying to do overtraining for 5 to 6 hours a day.

Similarly, drinking coffee regularly means consuming 1 to 2 cups of coffee a day.

Drinking several cups of coffee continuously is not necessarily good for your health.
