Hello, this is pkang.

A question about the set point has come up in the comments, so I will talk about the set point.

As I mentioned in the stagnation video,

Terms like stagnation and set point are used with different meanings depending on the person.

There is a need to organize the terminology.

The term "setpoint" is commonly used in two main contexts.

The first is that the body has a weight it remembers, and the second is that the body has a target weight it aims for.

These two seem similar yet a bit different, so I will discuss them one by one.

First, the set point that the body remembers regarding weight is...

If we stay at a specific weight for a long time,

My body remembers that weight as my set point, so it's the weight that suits my body.

It means that when you gain or lose weight, you are trying to return to your previous state.

For example, a person who has stayed at 80 kg for a long time

The body recognizes "my weight is indeed 80kg," and that becomes set as the set point.

Even if this person loses weight and becomes 70kg,

The weight that my body remembers is 80kg, so I am trying to return to 80kg again.

So you shouldn't lose weight all at once.

You need to lower the setpoint while having maintenance periods in between.

It is a theory that is advantageous for dieting.

This period is also referred to as the maintenance period.

The meaning of this phrase varies slightly depending on the person using it.

In some cases, after a certain amount of dieting has been done,

Loosen up a bit on exercise and diet.

The period of maintaining a slight increase in weight is also referred to as "daejigi."

Some people believe that when a weight loss plateau occurs, regardless of weight, it can be seen as a period that has a positive effect on building muscle.

However, there is one blind spot in the setpoint theory of this meaning.

If the body has a weight it remembers and wants to maintain that weight,

The yo-yo effect should not occur.

Recently, if I gain even a little weight after dieting,

This is also referred to as a yo-yo.

The original meaning of "yo-yo" refers to gaining more weight than before dieting.

So, a person who weighed 80kg lost weight to 70kg through a low-calorie, starvation diet.

When you eat the same foods you used to eat at 80kg, and your weight goes higher than 80kg, that's what is called yo-yo dieting.

However, there is a weight that the body remembers, and if it tries to return to that weight,

In this situation, the body's set point is 80 kg.

In that case, it's okay for your weight to increase up to 80kg, but it shouldn't go above 80kg.

When I weigh less than 80kg, it feels like I'm trying to go back to 80kg.

When your weight exceeds 80kg, you need to return to 80kg.

However, there are many people who actually experience weight gain after dieting, known as the yo-yo effect.

Um... the body has a homeostasis that aims to maintain the current weight.

I heard that the weight that the body tries to maintain is called the set point, is that not correct?

Homeostasis refers to the response aimed at maintaining the current state, rather than just maintaining the current weight.

Many people who are on a diet tend to pay attention to their weight.

The phrase "I want to maintain the current state"

There are cases where this is interpreted as trying to maintain the current weight.

Condition and weight are clearly different.

There are two people with the same weight.

If one has a lot of muscle mass and low body fat, they have a fit and lean body with good athletic ability.

People with low muscle mass and high body fat tend to have reduced physical abilities and become overweight.

These two bodies have the same weight, but their conditions are completely different.

So, there is a state that the body tries to maintain due to homeostasis, but...

It is not that the body has a weight that it remembers and tries to maintain.

So there is a weight that the body remembers, and this is called the set point.

The theory that the body tries to return to a set point is somewhat flawed.

In the next video, I will talk about the second story of the set point, which is about the body’s target weight.

There should be two videos displayed on the screen right now. Once the video is complete, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the Set Point Part 2 video, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.

If you found the video helpful, please subscribe and like it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
