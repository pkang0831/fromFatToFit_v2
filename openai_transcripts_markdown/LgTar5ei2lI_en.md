A comment has been posted asking for information about exercise and aging.

I am gradually increasing my full-body strength training to transition from being average to being lean.

I am worried that the increase in reactive oxygen species will accelerate aging and lead to presbyopia.

The video on eating habits to prevent aging was very helpful. Please also tell me about exercise methods.

First of all, to lose weight from being average to slim, you need to eat less and starve yourself.

There may be some people who wonder why we do full-body strength training.

It is possible to lose weight from obesity to a normal range through diet alone, but...

To go from being average to being lean, exercising is effective.

Of course, if you eat very little or fast for a long time, you can go from a normal weight to being underweight even without exercising.

In this case, you have to continue eating less and starving in order to maintain a thin body.

If I eat just a little more, the yo-yo effect will hit right away.

There is a problem of having to endlessly continue dieting.

No one wants to live like this.

So, I need to exercise.

The topic of this video is exercise and aging, so I will conclude the content here.

The method of dieting from average to thin without eating less or starving, while eating plenty, is about...

I will make sure to include related videos at the end of the video.

Those who are interested can take a look at that.

There are three main perspectives from which we can discuss exercise and aging.

The first perspective is the reactive oxygen species mentioned in the question.

The human body is always consuming energy.

However, during the process of consuming this energy, some of the oxygen transforms into reactive oxygen species.

This reactive oxygen species attacks our bodies while causing oxidative damage.

The stress that the body experiences from oxidation is called oxidative stress.

What reduces this oxidative stress is called antioxidant enzymes.

This antioxidant enzyme continues to decrease after the age of 20.

As we age, we are unable to reduce oxidative stress, which leads to various issues in the body.

This is aging caused by reactive oxygen species.

The important part here is that during the process of energy consumption, some of the oxygen is converted into reactive oxygen species.

When we use a lot of energy, we end up using a lot of oxygen.

If a lot of oxygen is used, naturally, the amount of reactive oxygen species will also increase.

Exercise is an activity that consumes a lot of energy, and

Therefore, there is a claim that exercising increases the amount of reactive oxygen species and accelerates the aging process.

I am doing the exercise that was mentioned in the question, but because of that, the levels of reactive oxygen species are increasing.

So the reason I'm worried about getting presbyopia is because of this.

From what we've discussed so far, it seems that exercising might accelerate aging.

If you want to prevent aging, it seems like you shouldn't exercise.

There is also a claim that exercising is better for preventing aging.

The second perspective on exercise and aging is telomeres.

The human body is made up of countless cells.

As this cell is created and time passes, problems arise as the cell ages.

These cells are referred to as senescent cells.

Our bodies maintain youth and health by transforming these aging cells into healthy cells.

There are two main ways to convert aging cells into healthy cells.

The first is cell division, and the second is autophagy.

Cell division eliminates aging cells and creates new cells to fill the empty spaces.

Autophagy is a mechanism in which aging cells consume themselves and become healthy cells again.

Right now, we are talking about telomeres, and since telomeres are related to cell division,

I will talk about autophagy next time.

Telomeres are proteins that are attached to the ends of chromosomes.

Each time cell division occurs, there is a characteristic of gradually becoming shorter.

So, humans have a certain number of cell divisions determined by something called telomeres.

Once this cell has used up all its division cycles, it can no longer create new cells.

So, if we keep using old cells, the whole body will age as a result.

So, this telomere is referred to as a biological clock.

If you preserve telomeres well or extend their length,

It is believed that aging can be prevented.

So, what can we do to preserve or lengthen telomeres?

A survey was conducted with thousands of people to determine who is effectively preserving their telomeres.

Two criteria were applied to individuals with well-preserved telomere length.

The first was exercise, and the second was stress.

People who engage in various physical activities and experience less stress have well-preserved telomeres.

People who do not exercise and experience a lot of stress have shorter telomere lengths.

From the perspective of reactive oxygen species, exercising accelerates aging.

From the perspective of telomeres, exercising has the effect of preventing aging.

The reason for this discussion is that how we exercise is important.

There is an experiment that compares how telomeres are affected by different types of exercise.

Participants in the experiment were divided into an aerobic exercise group, an interval training group, and a weight training group.

After exercising for 35 minutes a day, three times a week, for six months, I checked my telomeres.

In both the aerobic exercise group and the interval training group, an increase in telomere length was observed.

In the weight training group, the length of the telomeres did not increase.

What differences were there between the aerobic exercise and interval training group and the weight training group?

It is the amount of activity.

Cardio exercise and interval training fundamentally involve moving the entire body to work out.

On the other hand, weightlifting exercises are performed while keeping the posture fixed.

It is a method to prevent injuries caused by weight and to focus on exercising the muscles that create the desired atmosphere.

Because the posture is fixed, the overall activity level of moving the body is low.

This means that exercises that involve a lot of movement of the entire body have the effect of preventing aging.

If I think back to the survey that was mentioned earlier,

People who are active and engage in various forms of exercise tend to have relatively longer telomeres.

A similar conclusion can be drawn from the perspective of reactive oxygen species.

Exercises that involve a lot of movement for the whole body use all the muscles in the body.

In this case, the intensity of the exercise is determined based on the weakest muscle.

If the weakest muscle gets tired first and cannot function, then you won't be able to exercise.

When you actually start running, it's often other parts of your body that get tired before your lower body, causing you to stop running.

Due to the heart and lungs, there is a lack of breath, and because of that, I stop running.

I stop running because my stomach hurts due to weak abdominal muscles.

The intensity of the exercise is determined based on the weakest part of my body's muscles.

The energy consumption is relatively low, and therefore the amount of reactive oxygen species produced is also low.

However, weight training is conducted by targeting specific areas.

You set the weight, repetitions, and sets according to the area of the body you are exercising.

So, for the areas where the muscles are big and strong, you should exercise them vigorously accordingly.

For areas where the muscles are small and weak, the exercise should be done lightly to match that.

Even though it's considered light exercise, from the perspective of the muscles, it's still a strong workout.

Since we exercise as much as possible tailored to each area, the energy expenditure is high.

As a result, a lot of reactive oxygen species are generated.

However, if the energy expenditure is low, even if reactive oxygen species are produced in smaller amounts, it won't lead to weight loss.

If you exercise with an intensity that matches weak muscles, won't that prevent muscle growth?

First of all, just because the energy expenditure is low doesn't mean that dieting is not possible.

I have mentioned this several times in other videos.

The reduction of body fat does not solely depend on the energy expended through exercise.

I will make sure to include related videos at the end of the video to explain why that is.

And it's not that muscle growth isn't possible.

The intensity of the exercise is determined based on the weakest muscle.

There is less stimulation for already strong muscles, but

Weak muscles receive enough stimulation, and therefore, weak muscles will develop.

When weak muscles develop, you can then increase the exercise intensity a bit more.

If you continue to do this, eventually all the muscles in your body will develop.

When you first start running, you often stop quickly due to stomach pain or shortness of breath.

If you keep at it consistently, your breathing will stabilize and you won't have a stomachache.

So, muscle growth happens slowly; it doesn't mean that muscle growth isn't occurring.

Ah... But then muscle growth is too slow, right?

It seems like it might be too slow compared to weight training.

Yes, that's right.

Weight training was originally created to promote rapid muscle growth.

So, building muscle is obviously much faster with weight training.

However, it is natural for side effects to occur during the process of rapidly changing the body.

Many people want to lose weight very quickly.

However, as everyone knows, rapid dieting has side effects.

Weight training that rapidly builds muscle in the same concept has the side effect of aging.

The third perspective on exercise and aging is stress.

In the survey mentioned earlier,

People who experience less stress have well-preserved telomere lengths.

It was said that people who experience a lot of stress have shorter telomeres.

So, it's important to reduce stress.

Light exercise has the effect of relieving stress.

On the other hand, excessive exercise puts stress on the body.

So, reactive oxygen species, telomeres, stress—regardless of the perspective you take.

Excessively intense exercise can accelerate aging.

Exercise that is not like that has the effect of preventing aging.

So, really light exercise... Does that mean I can just do something like walking?

No, that's not the case.

If the intensity of the exercise is too low, the activity and exercise are not distinguished.

For example, for someone who sits all day and hardly walks at all,

Walking in the park for an hour feels like a slightly challenging intensity.

For such a person, walking can be a form of exercise.

However, for someone who usually walks a lot and has no problem walking for an hour in the park,

Walking for an hour is not exercise. It's just the same as any everyday activity.

In this case, it is labeled as exercise, but in reality, it is not actually exercising.

And if we think back to the survey that was mentioned earlier,

People who do not exercise have shorter telomere lengths.

You need to exercise at a level that is slightly challenging for your body.

However, when you exercise, energy is consumed, and when energy is consumed, reactive oxygen species are produced, right?

I understand that if the exercise intensity is somewhat difficult, there won't be a lot of reactive oxygen species produced.

If you keep repeating that exercise, your muscles will develop and become accustomed to it.

Then, after that, you need to do stronger exercises, right?

If you engage in stronger exercise, you will consume more energy.

So, in the end, doesn't that produce a lot of reactive oxygen species?

No, that's not correct.

If you exercise from the beginning, your muscles will develop and become accustomed to it.

The energy expended from that exercise actually decreases.

In a moment, four videos will appear on the screen.

In the top left, when you continue to exercise.

I will make a video explaining the reasons why the energy expended during exercise decreases.

And in aging, stress is as important as exercise.

Many people have misconceptions about this stress.

Due to this misunderstanding, even in situations where I shouldn't be stressed, I continue to feel stressed.

This is causing accelerated aging.

So, I'll make sure to have a video that clears up misconceptions about stress in the top right corner.

If you want to reduce stress and prevent aging, you can take a look at this.

In the bottom left, there is what appeared at the beginning of the video.

Create a video about how to diet from normal to slim while eating until full.

In the bottom right, I will have a video explaining why weight loss does not solely depend on the calories burned through exercise.

You can choose and watch the video that you need from the four available videos.
