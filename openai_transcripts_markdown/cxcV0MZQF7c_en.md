Ovulation Period and One Week Before Menstruation - Menstrual Diet Part 2

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video about menstruation and dieting.

In the first part of the video, we talked about the reason behind the saying "You can gain weight just by drinking water."

In this video, we will discuss the changes in weight and appetite according to the menstrual cycle and how to cope with them.

If you want to watch Part 1 of the video, you can click the link that is displayed in the top right corner.

From a dieting perspective, the menstrual cycle of women can be categorized as follows:

It can be divided into four stages: ovulation, one week before menstruation, menstruation, and one week after menstruation.

The ovulation period refers to the time when an egg is released.

This is the time when preparations for pregnancy begin, aligned with ovulation.

Since this is just the beginning stage, there aren't any significant changes in appetite or weight.

However, as you approach the later part of the ovulation period, your weight gradually increases and your appetite slowly intensifies.

As you enter the week before your period, your weight and appetite tend to peak.

The reason for weight gain is as discussed in Part 1 of the video.

This is because nutrients and moisture are stored in the body, and the glands and blood vessels in the endometrium increase.

The increase in appetite is also related to this.

The reason we eat food is to obtain energy from it and use that energy.

However, some of the energy from the food I ate was stored for the purpose of being used during pregnancy.

There is a lack of energy available for immediate use, and because of that, more food is needed.

Then, of course, your appetite will increase.

Energy is consumed here to thicken the uterine lining.

To replenish the energy consumed, more food is needed.

Then, your appetite will increase again.

From the body's perspective, it is better to have a larger amount of nutrients and water stored in preparation for pregnancy.

It sends a signal that more food is needed to store more nutrients and moisture.

This is what causes an increase in appetite.

Due to various factors like this, appetite tends to increase, making the appetite during this period really strong.

I want to eat so badly that I would even steal food if there is none.

It's a time when appetite becomes very strong, so it's really difficult to resist with willpower.

Struggling to suppress my appetite, even if I eat the same amount of food or less than usual.

Weight increases due to the weight of stored fluids and nutrients for pregnancy.

The weight of the increasing endometrial tissue causes an increase in body weight.

I experience weight gain even though I eat the same as usual or even less.

This is an incredibly huge source of stress.

So, if you are dieting during this period, there are many cases where people give up on the diet itself.

"I gain weight even if I eat less or the same amount."  
"My body type is cursed."

This is how we give up while talking like this.

If this is not the case, I won't give up on my diet.

There are many cases where suppressed appetite explodes, leading to binge eating of processed foods.

Both are not very good for dieting.

However, the weight that increased for pregnancy tends to decrease after menstruation begins.

You don't need to stress too much about your increasing weight.

In situations where the body lacks energy, eating a bit more does not interfere with dieting.

You don't have to force yourself to suppress your appetite by eating less than usual or trying to maintain the same meals as usual.

Don't force yourself to hold back and then explode; avoid eating refined foods.

It's okay to eat more unrefined foods than usual. Your body is in a situation where it needs energy.

However, you should be careful not to mistake thirst for hunger.

Most of the food we eat contains moisture.

You can hydrate your body by drinking water, but you can also do it by eating food.

So when the body is dehydrated, it can show signs of thirst, but it can also show signs of hunger.

Looking at this, our bodies cannot distinguish between thirst and hunger.

There is a saying that if you mistake thirst for hunger and eat food, you will gain weight.

There is a dieting method that suggests drinking a glass of water instead of eating food right away when you feel hungry.

In the week before menstruation, the endometrial tissue is significantly thickening.

A large amount of blood is used in this process, which leads to a lack of hydration in the body.

This lack of moisture can manifest as hunger rather than thirst.

So if you feel hungry a week before your period, try drinking water to see if it's thirst.

If it's hunger rather than thirst, it's okay to eat more unrefined foods than usual.

However, mistaking thirst for hunger can lead to eating more food than the body actually needs.

If you eat refined foods instead of unrefined foods,

Weight increases due to food, and this weight does not decrease even when menstruation begins.

It's not that I've gained weight due to preparing for pregnancy; it's because of the food I'm eating.

So you need to pay close attention to this part.

In the next video, I will talk about the menstrual cycle and the week after menstruation.

There are currently two videos playing on the screen. Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.
