Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video about cellulite, created in response to questions about cellulite that were posted in the comments.

The link to the previous video is displayed in the top right, so if you want to watch the previous video, you can click on it.

Since there is a lot of content that continues from the previous video, it is advisable to watch it if possible.

In the previous video, it was mentioned that one of the causes of cellulite is inflammation caused by excess subcutaneous fat.

In that case, a person with low subcutaneous fat does not have inflammation caused by subcutaneous fat.

Such a person should not have cellulite.

Even individuals who are very thin and have low muscle and subcutaneous fat can have cellulite.

Why is this happening?

The causes in this case are inflammation of the muscles and fluid circulation disorders, which are two factors.

In this video, we will learn about muscle inflammation, and in the next video, we will explore fluid circulation disorders.

Cellulite caused by muscle inflammation occurs in thin people.

It appears in people who do jobs that require standing for long periods or walking a lot.

Thin people often have a low amount of both body fat and muscle mass.

If you use your legs a lot while having low muscle mass,

When excessive load is placed on the leg muscles, it can cause swelling in the legs or inflammation in the muscles.

At this time, when the fluid and inflammation accumulated in the legs clump together with subcutaneous fat, cellulite is formed.

Because the load applied to the legs is the cause.

Sometimes, massaging or stretching the legs can help reduce cellulite.

As a result, massages and stretching that reduce cellulite are very popular among women.

However, even if you relax your legs with massage or stretching,

If you stand for a long time again or walk a lot, there is a problem of cellulite forming again.

The load placed on the legs in the first place is the cause.

Even if you relax your legs without removing this cause,

In the end, since the cause has not been resolved, the same thing keeps happening.

That doesn't mean I can quit my job...

If you stand for a long time or walk a lot, is it impossible to get rid of cellulite?

That's not the case.

When a person who has not been exercising starts to work out for the first time,

As many injuries and inflammation occur in the muscles, it leads to muscle pain.

So for those who are exercising for the first time, if they work out too hard, they might end up taking a few days off due to muscle soreness.

However, as you continue to exercise, you will gradually stop experiencing muscle soreness.

You might feel a bit stiff since you're using your muscles a lot, but...

You don't feel muscle pain strong enough to prevent you from exercising.

So, in the case of people who exercise a lot, they may worry about not experiencing muscle soreness.

I sometimes feel envious when I see someone with muscle soreness.

There is something interesting here, isn't there?

Even if your muscles have become stronger, if you increase the intensity of your workout, a greater load will be placed on your muscles.

If a strong load is applied to the muscles, it could cause injury and inflammation, leading to muscle pain.

Why do people who exercise regularly not experience muscle soreness?

This is because as muscles develop, their ability to recover improves gradually.

So, if you build muscle through exercise, the recovery ability of the muscles increases.

Even if you use your muscles a lot, there are no issues caused by inflammation.

So, if we apply this to cellulite...

If you build muscle through exercise, even if you have to stand for long periods or walk a lot,

As long as the leg muscles can endure and recover, there is no limit.

My legs don't swell, and I don't have cellulite.

Then let's take another look at the question that appeared at the end of Part 2 of the video.

When you exercise, your muscles get damaged, and the damage causes inflammation.

The inflammation and subcutaneous fat clump together, causing the cellulite to worsen.

I heard that you shouldn't do exercises to build muscle.

Intense workouts that build muscle can cause inflammation in the muscles, and this inflammation can be a cause of cellulite.

In fact, there are people who say that exercising to reduce cellulite has made it worse.

However, this is a symptom that appears early when starting exercise.

Because the muscles are still weak, the recovery ability is insufficient, and that's the problem.

If you consistently exercise, your muscles will become stronger and your recovery ability will improve.

Cellulite caused by exercising, standing for long periods, or walking a lot.

Everything can be resolved.

I am a really thin person with low body fat and muscle mass, and I don't stand for long or do a lot of walking.

Why do I have cellulite?

In the beginning of the video, I mentioned that there are two reasons why cellulite can occur in thin people.

The first is cellulite caused by muscle inflammation.

The second is cellulite caused by fluid circulation disorders.

If you have cellulite even though you don't walk a lot or stand for long periods of time,

It may be cellulite caused by fluid circulation disorders.

In the next video, we will talk about fluid circulation disorders.

Once the video is completed, I will place a link in the upper right corner.

If the link is not available, it means that the video is still being made, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.
