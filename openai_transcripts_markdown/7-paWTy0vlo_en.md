This is a response video created in response to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

I know that foods with a high GI index can raise blood sugar levels rapidly, but is it okay to eat a little bit of high GI foods?

First, let me briefly explain the question.

In several videos, I mentioned that refined carbohydrates can quickly raise blood sugar levels significantly.

It was said that refined carbohydrates are a cause of obesity.

So it was said that it is better to reduce the intake of refined carbohydrates and consume unrefined carbohydrates instead.

Unrefined carbohydrates refer to fruits and vegetables.

After looking at this content, someone once said that...

I asked the question, "Fruits contain fructose, and eating a lot can make you gain weight. Is it okay to eat a lot of fruit?"

So I created a fruit video as a response video.

You asked a question because you didn't quite understand it after seeing that.

The fruit video is linked in the top right corner, so you can click on it to watch.

First, I will briefly summarize the content of the video.

As the relationship between obesity and rising blood sugar levels became known, the GI index also gained popularity.

It is a measurement taken 30 minutes after eating to indicate how much the blood sugar has increased.

A high GI index means that the carbohydrates in the food are quickly digested and absorbed.

This means that it is quickly converted into glucose.

Foods with a high GI index have also been classified as fattening foods.

However, the GI index does not take into account the carbohydrate content of food, which leads to issues in interpretation.

The GL index is what corrects such errors.

According to the GL index, fruits are not considered fattening foods.

After watching the video, I heard that foods with a high GI index are fattening foods.

The question is about not understanding that it is sufficient for only the carbohydrate content to be low.

First, we need to clarify the concept of the GI index.

Foods with a high GI index are quickly digested and absorbed, which causes blood sugar levels to rise rapidly.

This part is correct.

However, the speed at which blood sugar rises and the fact that blood sugar reaches a high level are different concepts.

To make it easier to understand, for example,

Imagine there is a cup of water, and you dissolve sugar and candy in the water to make a sugar solution.

Water is the blood of our body.

Sugar dissolves quickly in water, so foods with a high glycemic index (GI) cause blood sugar to rise rapidly.

Candy has a slow dissolution rate in water, so it would correspond to foods with a low GI index.

The fructose found in fruits quickly raises blood sugar levels, so it is equivalent to sugar.

A high GI index but low carbohydrate content means that

It is sugar that dissolves well in water, but it means that the amount of sugar is small.

No matter how quickly sugar dissolves in water, if the amount of sugar is small, the water won't be very sweet.

So, foods that have a low GI index and low carbohydrate content are

The speed at which blood sugar rises is slow, and the height it reaches is low, so it does not increase blood sugar levels.

Vegetables fall under this type of food.

Foods that have a low GI index but high carbohydrate content are

The rate at which blood sugar rises is slow.

We can't exceed the amount we use in our bodies at every moment, so our blood sugar doesn't rise too high.

And it exits the body before being fully absorbed.

Foods like whole grains such as brown rice fall into this category.

Foods with a high GI index but low carbohydrate content.

This food raises blood sugar levels quickly.

However, because the increase in height is low, it is not a food that raises blood sugar.

Fruits fall under this category.

The last fourth food has a high GI index and also contains a lot of carbohydrates.

Because the speed at which blood sugar rises is too fast,

The rate at which it increases is faster than the amount used by the body.

And because the carbohydrate content is high, the height it rises to is also high.

This type of food raises blood sugar levels.

This type of food is refined carbohydrates.

I will summarize.

Foods that have both a high glycemic index (GI) and high carbohydrate content, like refined carbohydrates, are foods that raise blood sugar levels.

Foods that have a low glycemic index or low carbohydrate content, such as vegetables, whole grains, and fruits, are...

It is not a food that significantly raises blood sugar levels.

Sounds plausible, right?
