Why do the pounds lost with diet pills come back so quickly?

All videos have subtitles.

I took diet pills and lost about 10 kg.

I have returned to my weight before taking medication after two months.

I did go on a diet with medication, and I lost 10 kg, but...

Why does this diet lead to yo-yo effects so quickly?

A question with this kind of content has come up, so I would like to discuss it a bit.

When a problem occurs, there are generally two main ways to solve it.

It's about solving the cause of the problem and addressing the consequences of the problem.

For example, let's say you injured your arm, and as a result, you are feeling pain.

The cause is the injury to the arm, and the pain being felt is the result.

Treating an injured arm means addressing the root cause of the problem.

By giving painkillers to block the pain, it is a way to address the outcome of the problem.

If I treat my injured arm, the pain won't come back, right?

There must be a cause, such as an injured arm, for there to be a result like pain.

Since the cause has been addressed by treating the injured arm, there is no result of pain.

However, if you take painkillers, the pain will go away, but...

The injured arm that is causing pain remains as it is.

The cause remains unchanged, and only the result has been addressed.

In this case, if you don't take painkillers, you will start to feel pain again.

The cause remains the same.

Let's apply the examples of an injured arm and pain mentioned earlier to obesity.

The causes of obesity are poor eating habits and lifestyle choices.

An increase in body fat leading to obesity is a result.

Do diet pills affect the cause or the result?

This is the result.

I took appetite suppressants as diet pills.

Since your appetite has decreased, hasn't it affected your eating habits?

Let's say there is a person who likes snacks and delivery food and has a habit of eating them often.

If this person takes appetite suppressants,

Will I come to like other foods instead of snacks and delivery food?

No.

The eating habits that cause obesity remain unchanged.

The medication reduces my appetite, and that's why I'm losing body fat.

They just solved the result while leaving the cause unchanged.

When you stop taking diet pills, your appetite increases, leading to a rise in your food intake again.

If the eating habits of liking snacks or delivery food remain the same and the amount of meals increases,

Of course, I will gain weight again.

This is the reason why yo-yo dieting happens so quickly.

So the problem is relying solely on diet pills without a proper diet and exercise?

So, can I lose weight with diet pills and then follow a healthy diet and exercise afterwards?

In theory, that's how it is.

However, among those who take diet pills, there is no one who intends to take them for a lifetime.

Since it's difficult to focus on diet and exercise right now, I'll start by getting help from diet pills.

After losing weight, I will maintain a slim body by following a proper diet and exercise routine.

Most people who take diet pills do so with this mindset.

However, most of them fail.

Because a person's thoughts change depending on the situation.

In Korea, there is a saying that going into and coming out of the bathroom is different.

In urgent situations where you need to use the restroom,

Even if I have to pay a lot of money, I think I want to go to the bathroom.

When you come out of the bathroom, you feel that money is wasted.

Starting tomorrow, I will work hard on my diet and exercise, and this time I must succeed in my weight loss journey.

Even if I make this decision,

When the next day comes, it's human nature to not want to stick to the diet and exercise.

Right now, I am not following a diet or exercising, but I am getting help from diet pills.

After losing weight with diet pills, I will work hard on my diet and exercise.

Will this work?

It doesn't work.

If you can't do it now, you won't be able to do it then either.

To summarize,

Diet pills can be effective, but...

Among the causes of obesity and the consequences of obesity, it only affects the consequences.

You may lose weight while taking the medication, but once you stop, you will experience a rebound effect.

Then I have to diet again, right?

I dislike the result of having a body that is fat with a lot of body fat.

Many people focus only on solving the results, which is why they continue to experience yo-yo effects.

If you no longer want to experience yo-yo dieting,

You need to focus on solving the cause, not the result.

But if that's the logic, isn't it the same for diet and exercise?

If you lose weight with a diet plan, you'll gain it back once you stop the diet.

If you lose weight through exercise, you'll gain it back once you stop exercising.

It's good to say that we need to address the causes rather than just the results.

How are you going to address the reasons for liking foods like snacks, chicken, and pizza?

You can solve it by changing the types of food you eat.

There was a comment saying that they don't have the confidence to eat a diet plan for a lifetime and that they don't want to do that either.

I made a video about the reasons why you don't have to eat a lifelong diet.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.
