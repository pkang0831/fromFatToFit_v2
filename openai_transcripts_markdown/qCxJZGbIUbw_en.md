If there are many harmful bacteria, you can gain weight even if you eat little.

All videos have subtitles.

There are a lot of bacteria living in the organs of our body.

I have heard that if there are many bacteria that cause obesity, even eating a little can lead to weight gain.

Is this really true?

A question with this kind of content was posted in the comments, so I would like to discuss it.

First of all, it is true that gut microorganisms affect obesity.

There is actually an example of an experiment that was conducted.

The stool of one twin who is obese and the other who is slim.

When fed to germ-free mice that were born via cesarean section and had never been exposed to germs,

Mice that consumed the feces of obese individuals gradually became obese themselves.

The rat that ate the feces of a slim person did not become obese.

There is also an experiment that feeds the same amount of food.

In that experiment, only the mice that ate the feces of obese individuals became obese.

There was also an experiment where a rat that ate the feces of an obese person ate less.

In that experiment, the mice that ate the feces of obese individuals became obese themselves.

So, gut microorganisms affect obesity.

In some cases, it is possible to become obese even by eating little.

How do gut microorganisms contribute to obesity?

The gut microbiota consists of tens of trillions of microorganisms, and they perform a wide variety of functions.

There are also bacteria that resynthesize the sugars we consume, making it difficult for the body to absorb them.

On the contrary, there are also bacteria that promote the absorption of sugar and raise blood sugar levels.

There are also bacteria that induce the secretion of the hunger hormone ghrelin, leading to overeating.

There are also bacteria that increase the secretion of insulin hormones, leading to the accumulation of body fat.

The rise in blood sugar, overeating, and insulin secretion are all factors that can contribute to obesity.

People who have many microorganisms in their gut that perform such tasks

Even if they eat the same amount of food as someone who is not like them, they can become obese more easily.

In severe cases, one can become obese even by eating less.

It is possible to gain weight even when eating little.

Nutrients are absorbed in the intestines.

I understand that gut microorganisms can be involved in the absorption of nutrients, but...

Is it possible to be involved in hormone secretion?

It is definitely possible.

In fact, more than 90% of serotonin hormone is produced in the gut.

Less than 10% of serotonin is produced in the brain.

So, we didn't know that the intestine is originally an organ that affects hormone metabolism.

An organ that thinks about the intestines because of this.

It is also referred to as the second brain.

I understand that obesity can be influenced by gut microorganisms.

So, what should I do to help with my diet?

You can change the composition of your gut microbiota by changing the types of food you eat.

Among the gut microorganisms, those that provide beneficial effects to our body are called beneficial bacteria.

Bacteria that have harmful effects on our bodies are called harmful bacteria.

The higher the ratio of beneficial bacteria and the lower the ratio of harmful bacteria,

It is helpful for health and dieting.

The food we eat progresses through digestion and then moves into the intestines.

Food that has passed into the intestines serves as nourishment for both beneficial and harmful bacteria.

Processed refined foods primarily serve as food for harmful bacteria.

Less processed, unrefined foods mainly serve as food for beneficial bacteria.

So, by reducing the intake of processed foods, we can prevent the proliferation of harmful bacteria.

By increasing the intake of unprocessed foods, you can help beneficial bacteria thrive.

By reducing harmful bacteria and increasing beneficial bacteria, it is possible to change the composition of gut microbiota.

In summary, the composition of gut microbiota significantly affects obesity.

To help with dieting, it is important to improve the composition of gut microbiota.

We need to reduce the intake of processed refined foods and eat unrefined foods.

In a video about the principles of dieting, I talked about refined foods and unrefined foods.

The theory of refined and unrefined foods is the most fundamental theory for dieting.

The diet methods you know right now.

And also the diet methods you will learn about in the future.

You always said that this theory is included.

New information has emerged regarding gut microbiota, but...

There is no change in what needs to be done for dieting.

There is just one more reason to eat unrefined foods.

Just keep doing your best as you always have.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

Besides eating the food of beneficial bacteria.

What do you think about consuming beneficial bacteria to change the composition of gut microbiota?

These days, if you look at social media, the diet probiotic product called BNR 17 is very popular.

I heard that this has been certified to have a dieting effect.

Can taking that probiotic product help with dieting?

In the next video, we will talk about BNR 17.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have it appear in the top right corner once the next video is completed.

If the next video is not completed, another video is scheduled to be released.

If the video in the upper right is not Part 2 of the gut microbiome,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

You mentioned that the theory of refined and unrefined foods is the most fundamental aspect of dieting.

Please tell me more about that theory.

I previously made a video that completely covered refined and unrefined foods.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top left.

You can choose and watch the video you are curious about.
