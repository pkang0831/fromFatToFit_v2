A question with the following content was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content first.

What do you think about the theory presented in the book "Confessions of a Vegetarian Doctor," which claims that meat and dairy products are the causes of strokes and diseases, and suggests obtaining calories from starch?

I received a question and read a book about the confessions of a vegetarian doctor.

The book consists of a total of 12 chapters.

Chapter 1 introduces the author and explains the reasons for writing the book.

Chapters 2 to 3 provide an introduction to starchy foods and their benefits, along with recommendations.

Chapter 4 addresses the issues related to meat consumption.

In chapters 5 and 6, it is stated that changing one's diet can cure diseases, but there are people who conceal this information for their own benefit.

Chapter 7 discusses how it is possible to obtain sufficient protein from a vegetarian diet.

Chapters 8, 9, and 11 discuss that there is no need to obsess over specific foods or supplements to obtain nutrients like calcium and omega-3.

Chapter 10 discusses that there are both suitable and unsuitable methods for a starch-based vegetarian diet.

The last chapter discusses salt and sugar.

First of all, since Chapter 1 is an introduction to the author, I will exclude it.

I agree with the idea that changing eating habits can treat diseases, which is covered in 5 to 6 pages.

I believe there is a possibility that such information is being downplayed or concealed for profit in the food and medical industries.

I will exclude this as well. I generally agree.

Chapter 7 is about vegetarianism and protein.

There is a video I made in the past about whether it's possible to get enough protein from a vegetarian diet.

This video covered it in detail.

To put it simply, it is theoretically possible, but there was a condition that you need to eat 2 to 3 kg of vegetables every day.

The video link is displayed in the upper right, so if you're curious about the content, please take a look.

I will exclude the content that came from another video.

I also agree with the contents of Chapters 8, 9, and 11.

I have a video related to brown rice that I recently made.

It is true that there are good nutrients in brown rice in this video, but...

The nutrients are not only found in brown rice but also in other foods.

I mentioned that there's no need to be overly obsessed with brown rice.

If you're curious about the video content, there's a video link in the top right corner, so you can click it to watch the video.

I will also exclude the content from chapters 8, 9, and 11.

Then, there are the contents of Chapters 2, 3, 4, 10, and 12 left. I will discuss these in detail.

Chapter 2 discusses the reasons for eating starchy foods.

The reason is that fruits and vegetables are insufficient.

First, let's take a look at the content of the book.

Fruits provide energy very quickly in the form of simple sugars, but

It cannot provide energy continuously like starch.

So, starch is a continuous source of energy, while the simple sugars in fruits are a momentary source of energy.

This is the relationship between carbohydrates and fats that we commonly know.

The human body stores energy in two forms: carbohydrates and fats.

In the case of carbohydrates, the usage can be increased momentarily.

It is used when there is a sudden increase in energy, such as when lifting objects or jumping.

However, it has the characteristic of not having a large storage capacity.

Fat cannot increase its usage instantly.

It cannot be used in places where energy is urgently needed.

This is the energy used by internal organs that require a steady supply of energy due to their large reserves.

So, carbohydrates are a source of immediate energy, while fats are a source of sustained energy.

The relationship between simple sugars in fruits and starch is very similar.

Fruits and vegetables are good foods, but

Because they do not provide sufficient calories and satiety, starchy foods need to be consumed together.

This is also something I have repeated in other videos while explaining the diet.

To maintain our health and diet, we should stay away from refined carbohydrates.

It is good to eat unrefined carbohydrates such as fruits and vegetables.

If you only eat these two things, you won't get enough calories.

Filling in insufficient calories with meat is referred to as the pkang diet.

So it seems that staying away from refined foods and eating a variety of unrefined foods like fruits and vegetables is important.

Up to this point, it's the same.

Do you fill the deficiencies in fruits or vegetables with starchy foods or with meat?

This is where the difference arises.

To break it down a bit more, it can be divided into whether it is permissible to eat meat or not.

Because the diet I am talking about does not prohibit the intake of starch.

There was a question in the comments asking if it's okay to eat potatoes or sweet potatoes, so I made a video saying that it's fine to eat them.

However, the book prohibits the consumption of meat.

In the end, I believe that both starch and meat are acceptable.

The book states that only starch is allowed, and not meat.

To answer the question asked here, "What do you think about the theory in the book?"

I think everything else is correct except for the part about not being able to eat meat.

The link to the next video should be appearing in the top right corner.

In the next video, we will discuss the reasons why we should not eat the meat mentioned in the book.

I will discuss the reasons why I think I am okay.

If the video link is not available, please wait a few days as we are in the process of creating the video.

If you enjoyed the video, I would appreciate it if you could subscribe, recommend, and share.

Then I will come back with a different video next time.

See you next time, goodbye~~
