How to find the most effective diet plan for me.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I want to diet, but what should I eat and how?

There are many questions of this kind, so I would like to organize them a bit.

Explain step by step, one by one.

Ultimately, the goal is to enable individuals to create a diet plan that suits them.

As I explain step by step, there may be some overlap with the content of other videos.

Let's find out the reasons for becoming stage 1 obese.

The reason we become obese is that we eat too much food too often.

When we eat food, a hormone called insulin is released.

This insulin lowers elevated blood sugar by storing carbohydrates as glycogen or body fat.

Help the protein we consume to be used for muscle synthesis.

The fat we consume is stored as body fat.

Simply put, it's a hormone that processes the nutrients we consume.

If we eat a lot of food, a lot of insulin is also released.

One of the functions of insulin is to increase body fat.

An increase in insulin leads to obesity.

Eating a lot of food causes a lot of insulin to be released.

A lot of insulin stores the fats I eat as body fat, leading to obesity.

In that case, you can eat less food to reduce insulin production.

Isn't it possible to lose weight by eating less fat, even if you consume food that gets stored as body fat?

From this perspective, the diet that emerges is a low-calorie diet.

It involves either reducing the amount of food you eat or consuming foods that are low in fat.

This low-calorie diet has been around for over ten years, but it is not a highly successful dieting method.

The reason is simple: it's very difficult to maintain a diet.

No one in this world wants to become obese.

Anyone who doesn't want to become obese knows that they need to reduce their food intake.

However, people eat a lot of food and become obese.

Why do we eat a lot?

This is because there is a desire to eat food often and in large quantities.

A person who has become obese due to such desires suddenly eats less or

You can eat food, but what happens if you have to eat food you don't want to?

Of course, it would be natural to feel resistance and dislike.

This is why dieting is difficult, and that's why people give up on their diets.

Even if you succeed in dieting, the yo-yo effect will occur.

Then let's consider a more fundamental question.

Why do we want to eat a lot in the first place?

Let's talk about the second stage of appetite.

Why do we want to eat frequently and in large amounts to the point of becoming obese?

It's because of the type of food we eat.

Among foods,

When eating the same amount.

There are foods that cause the body to produce an excessive amount of insulin.

In the beginning of the video, one of the functions of insulin is...

You mentioned that there are ways to lower blood sugar and increase body fat.

When insulin is produced in excess, blood sugar levels can drop too low.

Our bodies always want to maintain a consistent blood sugar level.

When blood sugar drops too low, one realizes that they need to eat food to raise their blood sugar.

And the reason we eat food is to obtain energy from that food.

Due to too much insulin.

If the food I just ate gets stored as too much body fat...

I ate food, but I don't have enough energy to use right now.

So it becomes recognized that food is needed again.

Because of this, even if you eat a sufficient amount of food,

If that food causes too much insulin to be released, then you will feel hungry again.

So that's why people eat again and become obese.

So it's not that I'm hungry because I need food.

Too much insulin hormone is being released, and it is causing hunger because of that hormone.

This kind of hunger is called false hunger.

It's not that you actually need food; it's a false hunger caused by hormones.

If you eat food based on this false hunger,

I ate because I was hungry, but I ended up eating too much food, which is why I became obese.

On the contrary, if I eliminate this false hunger, I will only feel hungry when I truly need food.

When you eat food according to your hunger, there is no problem at all.

On the contrary, it can actually lead to weight loss.

So, I want to eat, but I shouldn't have to force myself to hold back.

It means to normalize your appetite and eat according to that normal appetite.

What foods cause a lot of insulin to be released in stage 3?

As mentioned earlier, insulin is a hormone that processes nutrients.

Therefore, foods that provide many nutrients to the body will likely cause a significant release of insulin.

For this to happen, the food itself must contain a lot of nutrients.

The food should be quickly digestible and absorbable.

If a food has many nutrients but is difficult to digest and absorb,

Many nutrients are not digested or absorbed, so the amount of nutrients entering the body is not large.

On the contrary, if the food is easily digested and absorbed but has a low amount of nutrients, then...

Even if everything is digested and absorbed, the nutrients that enter the body will be limited.

So the problem is with foods that are high in nutritional density but are quickly digested and absorbed.

Such food hardly exists in nature.

Processing low-nutrient-dense foods to increase their nutrient density.

Processing food that couldn't be eaten in large quantities so that it can be consumed more.

Foods that are slow to digest and absorb are processed to make them digest and absorb more quickly.

Let's take an example.

Brown rice is a grain, so it has a significantly high nutritional density.

However, most of the nutrients are in the kernel.

The kernel is protected by a shell.

Because the shell provides protection, it can be digested and absorbed after the shell is melted.

Even if it is said that digestion and absorption begin by melting the shell,

Phytic acid and dietary fiber in the skin interfere with digestion and absorption.

So the actual amount absorbed by the body is not very much.

It has a high nutritional density, but it is not easily digested or absorbed.

On the contrary, the nutrients in fruits are quickly digested and absorbed.

There is a saying that eating a lot of fruit can lead to obesity.

However, since 80-90% of fruits are made up of water,

It is difficult to eat such a large amount to the point of becoming obese.

There is actually a fruit diet that consists of having all meals made up of fruit.

There are no restrictions on the amount or time of eating.

When you're hungry, you can eat unlimited fruit until you're full.

However, even if you eat like that, you can still lose weight.

Many people have reduced their consumption of fruit-only diets because they have experienced other health issues.

The fruit diet itself definitely had a weight loss effect.

Eating fruits in abundance can still help with dieting.

It gained considerable popularity among many people.

Then let's process this kind of food.

Brown rice is high in nutritional density, but it was mentioned that the husk makes digestion and absorption difficult.

What happens if we mill this brown rice to remove its husk?

Since the shell that hinders digestion and absorption has disappeared, digestion and absorption will speed up.

The brown rice, which is high in nutritional density, has been processed to enhance digestion and absorption.

As many nutrients enter the body, a lot of insulin is released.

So, false hunger arises.

If you eat a lot of food because of this false hunger, you will eventually become obese.

Because of this, brown rice and white rice have similar nutritional components, but

White rice, which has been processed by removing the husk from brown rice, is said to be not good for dieting.

Fruits are digested and absorbed very quickly, but due to their water content, they have a low nutritional density.

So I said that I can't eat enough to the point of becoming obese.

What would happen if we remove the moisture from this fruit to make dried fruit?

By removing moisture, the nutritional density increases, making it easier to consume larger quantities.

In reality, when you dry 1 kg of bananas and remove the moisture, it becomes 200 g of banana chips.

Eating 1 kg of bananas is difficult, but

Eating 200g of banana chips is not difficult, right?

In 200g of banana chips, the nutrients found in 1kg of bananas are concentrated.

Eating a large amount of fruits that are quickly digested and absorbed can lead to obesity.

So that you can eat a lot of food that you couldn't eat much of.

To increase the nutritional density of low-nutrient foods.

The issue arises when foods that are slow to digest and absorb are processed to speed up digestion and absorption.

This process is called refinement.

Through this refining process, food that contains many nutrients for the body is called refined food.

On the contrary, foods that are not like that are called unrefined foods.

So, it means that eating unrefined foods leads to weight loss compared to eating refined foods.

This is the most fundamental principle of dieting.

All diet plans and methods are

It is created by adding other conditions on top of this basic principle.

For example, the increase in blood sugar due to carbohydrates and the excessive release of insulin are causes of obesity.

There is a low-carb, high-fat diet that suggests reducing carbohydrates and increasing fat intake.

Even if blood sugar levels rise and a lot of insulin is released, if there is no fat to be stored as body fat, weight will not increase.

Therefore, consuming fat is a cause of obesity.

So there is a high-fat, low-carb diet that suggests reducing fat and eating carbohydrates.

One side says to reduce carbohydrates and eat fats.

One side says to reduce fat and eat carbohydrates.

Because they are making completely opposing arguments.

If one side is right, the other side seems to be wrong.

So it seems that only one of the two might have a dieting effect, but...

In reality, both have a weight loss effect.

Because both diets prohibit the consumption of refined foods.

In a high-fat, low-carb diet, you can eat carbohydrates, but...

It is said that you should not eat snacks made from processed carbohydrates or fruit juices.

In a low-carb, high-fat diet, you can eat meat freely, but...

The consumption of processed meat made by grinding and mincing meat is prohibited.

So, the two diets are telling completely opposite stories, but...

Under the condition that one should not eat processed foods, there is a commonality.

This is what helps with dieting.

In other words, if you reduce the intake of refined foods and eat unrefined foods,

The rest is about how, no matter what you do, you can still lose weight.

Let's distinguish between refined and unrefined foods.

I understand that I need to reduce the intake of refined foods and eat unrefined foods in order to lose weight, but...

When I think about what and how I should eat, nothing comes to mind easily.

It's because I can't establish a reference point.

In Korea, there is something called "sambak food."

It means three types of white foods that make you gain weight.

I am talking about sugar, flour, and white rice.

Which of these three foods is the most refined?

It is sugar.

Sugar is made by extracting juice from sugarcane, filtering it, and then boiling it.

It has gone through a very extensive refining process, so it is the most refined food.

Flour is made by removing the husk of wheat and grinding it into a powder.

White rice is made by removing the husk from brown rice.

If we take sugar as a standard,

Sugar is a refined food, while flour and white rice are less refined than sugar.

If we take flour as the standard.

Sugar and flour become refined foods, while white rice becomes an unrefined food.

So, a person who often ate sweet bread or snacks made with sugar and flour

Reducing bread and snacks while eating white rice will help with dieting.

I found that eating white rice helped me lose weight because it's considered a diet food.

Not this concept.

Compared to the bread and snacks this person originally ate, white rice is an unrefined food.

That's how I ended up on a diet.

So, based on the food I originally used to eat,

It means that you should eat in a more irregular way to lose weight.

Ah... please don't explain the principles. Can't you just tell me how many grams to take?

No, it won't work.

It's a very obvious statement, but everyone is different.

The types of food and the amounts being consumed vary.

The amount of body fat and muscle mass is different, and the lifestyle patterns are also different.

Even the target weight and body shape are different.

In that case, effective diets can only vary from person to person.

This is something that is taken for granted.

Among the videos I made recently, there is one about a ballerina.

I have a career in ballet, so I have to be extremely thin.

Fasting and eating less only leads to a yo-yo effect.

I saw a comment asking for help because it was too difficult, so I made a video.

In that video, it keeps saying throughout the entire video to eat more carbohydrates.

Isn't it strange?

When you eat a lot of carbohydrates, your blood sugar rises, and insulin is released in large amounts.

If a lot of insulin is produced, it can lead to obesity.

When dieting, it is usually recommended to reduce carbohydrates.

Due to the nature of their profession, ballerinas need to be thinner than others.

Then shouldn't we reduce carbohydrates even more? That's what I'm thinking.

The reason that video said you should eat more carbohydrates is because...

It's because I'm burning a tremendous amount of carbohydrates through daily ballet practice, which is like exercising.

If you consume that many carbohydrates,

The problem arises from not filling that, which can lead to obesity.

It means that you should eat carbohydrates.

However, a person working in an office who does not exercise at all and sits all day long...

I want to be as slim as a ballerina.

So I thought I should eat the same foods that ballerinas eat.

If I watch your video, will eating a lot of carbohydrates help with dieting?

Of course not. The conditions are different.

If you search on YouTube right now, there are a lot of people sharing diet plans.

Please clearly tell me how many grams of each type of food I should eat.

However, even if you eat exactly what that person eats,

You won't have the same body shape.

Their diet plan is one that is effective for their bodies and lifestyle patterns.

Step 5: Now let's really create a meal plan.

You can eat foods that are less processed compared to the foods I used to eat before my diet.

If you had been eating a lot of snacks or bread.

Stop eating snacks or bread and eat rice instead.

I don't eat much snacks or bread, but I've gained weight because I eat a lot of rice.

Then you can switch to brown rice.

Since I was used to eating white rice, it's really hard for me to eat brown rice.

In that case, is it okay to mix brown rice and white rice?

Eating a mix of brown rice and white rice is healthier compared to just eating white rice alone.

I didn't eat much snacks or bread, but I was eating a lot of sausages and ham.

In that case, you can reduce sausages and ham and eat eggs, tofu, and meat instead.

If you haven't been eating vegetables regularly, you should consciously eat more vegetables.

There are no specific meats or vegetables that you must eat.

You can choose something that is easy for me to get, tastes good when I eat it, and is convenient to eat.

The final step is to make changes to the diet.

Even if I have created a diet that suits my body in the way I mentioned earlier,

As time goes by, that diet gradually becomes less suitable for me.

Because my body is changing.

The body that was obese due to excess body fat is getting closer to a normal weight as the body fat decreases.

A person who did not exercise starts to work out while dieting.

If a person who had no muscle mass at all increases their muscle mass, their body will change.

And when the body changes like this, the lifestyle patterns naturally change as well.

If my body and lifestyle patterns change like this, then naturally my diet should change as well.

My body keeps changing, and so the nutrients I need are also changing.

Ignoring all of that.

Sticking strictly to the diet plan I initially set is not the right way to diet.

You need to adjust your diet to fit my body.

I will summarize.

Eating processed foods can create false hunger.

This fake hunger creates a desire to eat often and in large amounts.

So, eating a lot of food leads to obesity.

In a state of this false hunger, dieting itself is difficult.

You should reduce refined foods and eat unrefined foods.

Eating unprocessed foods can have a weight loss effect in itself.

Since false hunger disappears, there is no need to force yourself to endure hunger.

And unrefined food is not something that is strictly defined.

I am talking about less processed foods compared to what I used to eat.

Under the condition that it is less processed food than what I originally ate.

It's easy for me to find.

It tastes good in my mouth.

You can create a meal plan based on the foods I like.

Finally, when you lose weight and your body changes, the diet that suits that body will also change.

Don't insist on sticking to the same diet unconditionally.

You can make changes to your diet based on your body's reactions.

So, by eating unrefined foods, you can normalize your appetite.

So, if I can trust my normal appetite, it means I can eat unrefined foods until I'm full, right?

But isn't this a way to avoid gaining weight rather than a diet method?

To lose weight, you need to eat less to make your body use fat.

No, that's not the case.

The reason for becoming obese is that one eats too much food.

If you don't eat too much food, you can still lose weight even if you eat until you're full.

In a moment, three videos will appear on the screen.

I will set up a video in the top left explaining why you can lose weight even if you don't eat less.

You said to change the diet when the body changes.

How can we know if change is needed, and how should we go about making those changes?

If my current body and diet do not match, it becomes difficult to maintain the diet.

When you are on a diet and suddenly feel the desire to eat something else,

Ignoring that desire, I force myself to stick to the diet.

Then, when I can no longer hold it in, I binge eat.

When eating unprocessed foods, there is no false hunger.

The desire to eat different foods is a signal that a change in your diet is needed.

You can make changes according to that signal.

In the upper right corner, I will have a video explaining how to change my diet according to my body's signals.

It's great that you can lose weight without eating less, but...

If you diet in that way, you can lose weight from obesity to a normal range.

Isn't it impossible to lose weight from average to slim?

To go from average to slim through dieting, it seems like you ultimately have to eat less or starve yourself.

No, that's not correct.

Rather, when dieting from average to thin, you should not eat less food.

I have prepared a video on how to diet from normal to slim on the left side.

You can choose and watch the video that you need from the three options.
