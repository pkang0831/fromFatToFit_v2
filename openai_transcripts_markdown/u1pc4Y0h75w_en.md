Even if you reduce processed foods, doesn't that create false hunger when you eat?

All videos have subtitles.

The reason we become obese is that we eat too much food.

The reason for eating too much food is due to the fake hunger created by processed foods.

To diet, you should reduce your intake of processed foods.

It's something I always say.

However, in modern society, it is impossible to live without eating even a bite of processed food.

In that case, we need to reduce processed foods to eliminate false hunger.

What does this information mean?

A comment with this content was posted.

So, I can't live without eating even a bite of processed food, but...

It is possible to reduce it, and just reducing it alone can be effective.

I created a video about the idea that it's good to try within the range of what you can do.

However, an interesting comment was posted on that video.

The most difficult part of dieting is figuring out how much you should eat.

If you eat a lot, you won't be able to lose weight.

On the contrary, if you eat too little, a hunger response occurs, making it difficult to lose weight.

How much should I eat?

The way you solve this problem will determine the different methods of dieting.

The way I talk is

Reduce processed foods to eliminate false hunger and then restore the body to normal.

When the body is in a normal state, you only feel hungry when you need food.

If you are hungry, eat food to prevent the hunger response from occurring.

Conversely, if you are not hungry, it means there is no need to eat.

Just doing that will help you lose weight.

However, a person who can completely eliminate processed foods and remove false hunger is in an environment where...

You could use that method, but...

Like students who eat school meals or office workers who buy lunch.

People who have no choice but to eat processed foods

Since it is impossible to completely eliminate false hunger from the beginning, it is an unusable method.

Therefore, it may feel meaningless to people in such an environment.

A comment with this content has been posted.

I was a bit surprised after reading that comment.

Ah! I realized that one could think like that.

Reduce processed foods to eliminate false hunger. Because of this statement.

Eating processed foods creates false hunger.

If you don't eat processed foods, fake hunger disappears.

The error lies in recognizing the situation as divided into two cases: one with false hunger and one without.

There is such a thing as false hunger. It's not something that can be clearly divided like this.

It has a continuity of becoming stronger and weaker.

So, if you eat a lot of processed foods, the fake hunger becomes stronger and stronger.

Reducing processed foods weakens false hunger gradually.

Let's think about the process of how we become obese.

One day, after eating processed food, I felt a false sense of hunger.

Do you suddenly start eating a lot from the next day?

That's not the case.

Because of the processed food I ate yesterday, I experienced false hunger.

Because of that false hunger, I ate a little more today than yesterday.

Today, because I ate a bit more processed food, the fake hunger has become a bit stronger.

Due to the slightly stronger false hunger, I will end up eating more tomorrow.

By eating a little more and more frequently like this, body fat increases, leading to obesity.

The problem is that this process progresses very slowly, making it difficult to recognize.

As fake hunger intensifies, it leads to a point where you can't think about eating at all.

When you see people who have actually succeeded in dieting but then experienced a rebound,

At first, I have reservations about eating processed foods.

So the day after eating a lot of processed food, I check my weight and figure carefully.

However, if you frequently and excessively consume processed foods, the false sense of hunger can become stronger.

The sense of vigilance disappears.

So you stop checking your weight or body shape.

At some point, you just eat without thinking at all.

And one day, you suddenly realize that you have gained weight.

Body fat does not increase quickly, nor does it decrease quickly.

It must have taken time for you to gradually become obese.

It is the inability to recognize the gradual process of becoming obese.

And I don't eat a lot, but I keep gaining weight and have become severely obese.

If you observe a person who talks like this for 24 hours,

The amount of food eaten during mealtime can sometimes be small.

However, I eat snacks like chips very often and in large quantities.

The problem is that you are not aware of it.

So I don't eat a lot, but I still think I'm gaining weight.

As mentioned earlier, when false hunger intensifies,

It means that the perception of eating food itself becomes blurred.

Reducing the intake of processed foods will weaken this false hunger.

When false hunger weakens, thoughts and willpower can come into play.

So, I came back to my seat after having lunch, and my colleague next to me gave me some snacks.

When the false hunger is strong, I receive snacks when offered.

I just had lunch and I'm full, but...

Since there are snacks, I just open them and eat without thinking.

When false hunger weakens,

I accept the snacks when they are given to me, but...

I just had lunch, so I'm full. Should I eat later? This is the kind of thought I have.

When false hunger weakens further,

I either don't accept the snacks at all or I take them and give them to someone else.

So the fake hunger is so strong that I have no thoughts about food at all.

As the false hunger weakens, I start to think about food.

This thought changes actions.

Due to the changed behavior, reduce processed foods even more.

By reducing processed foods even more, the false hunger becomes weaker.

The most important part of this entire process is

This is the very first part that weakens false hunger.

This part was discussed as reducing processed foods to eliminate false hunger.

So to summarize,

When you eat processed food and experience false hunger.

If you eat processed foods again, the false hunger will become stronger.

If you eat more processed foods due to stronger fake hunger,

We become obese due to a vicious cycle where false hunger becomes stronger.

Even if I eat processed food and feel false hunger,

If you don't eat processed foods afterward, fake hunger will weaken.

When false hunger weakens, even if you eat processed foods, you tend to eat less.

If you eat less processed food, the fake hunger that arises from it will weaken.

So you don't have to worry that the hunger I'm feeling right now is fake hunger.

Whether there is false hunger or not is not what matters.

The problem is eating a lot of food due to false hunger.

If you reduce processed foods, it will weaken false hunger.

Before reducing processed foods, the amount you eat will definitely decrease.

Then that much will be a diet, right?

And according to this positive cycle, the diet continues.

So, first of all, you can reduce processed foods as much as you can.

That is the most important thing.

In the comments on the last video, I saw a comment like this.

It is important to start.

Most people don't even start.

Just by starting, you can become part of the top 10%.

So don't worry about efficiency or anything like that, just go ahead and do it.

It is said to be something that an online instructor said, and it is indeed true.

I watched the video well, but what should I do about my diet?

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have a video that explains the principles of dieting in detail at the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

Since I reduced processed foods, it seems that my false hunger has weakened, and my cravings have really decreased a lot.

But I don't know how much I should eat.

When there is false hunger, you eat mindlessly whenever you see food, so you don't realize it.

As the false hunger weakens, when I start to think...

I end up in a state where I don't know how full my stomach should be.

I previously made a video about satiety because the same question came up.

I will make sure to have a video about satiety appear in the top right.

If you are unsure about the right portion size for you, you can click here to find out.

Reducing processed foods has significantly decreased my appetite.

Every month, when that time comes for women, my appetite goes wild.

What should I do about this?

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a related video.

I will make sure the video appears in the bottom left.
