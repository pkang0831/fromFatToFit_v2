Hello, this is pkang.

In this video, I will talk about how to diet from a normal weight to a beauty weight.

For women, the methods of dieting from an obese weight to a normal weight are

How to diet from a normal weight to a cosmetic weight.

There are many cases where people think differently.

I know that low-calorie diets and starvation diets are not good, but...

This only applies in cases of dieting from obesity to normal weight.

To diet from a normal weight to a cosmetic weight,

I think that a low-calorie diet or fasting diet is necessary.

Why do you think this way?

Cosmetic weight refers to the weight of a slim and aesthetically pleasing body, regardless of actual weight and health.

In other words, if you achieve a slim and attractive body...

It means that even if you are underweight and not healthy, you can still achieve a beauty weight.

A low-calorie diet is not good; you should not starve yourself.

I have heard this kind of story many times, and I know that it is not good for my health, but...

In the first place, the goal is to achieve an unhealthy low weight.

I think that healthy diet methods do not apply to me.

And this thought is not completely wrong.

As I mentioned in the video about the principles of dieting without feeling hungry,

The human body reacts in a way that is most advantageous for survival in its surrounding environment.

A body with a high amount of body fat has the body fat itself negatively affecting it.

A heavy body has low activity levels, which is disadvantageous for survival.

A body with a high amount of body fat has a strong response to try to reduce its body fat on its own.

So, if we just reduce the intake of refined foods that increase appetite, we can avoid overeating.

Body fat will naturally decrease on its own.

In reality, eating whole cuts of meat rather than processed meats like ham, sausage, or patties is preferred.

Reduce the intake of sugar and flour.

If you eat brown rice instead of white rice and vegetables or fruits instead of grains,

Even if you eat until you're full, it can still have the effect of reducing body fat.

However, this diet method is only a way to achieve a normal weight.

It is not a way to go from a normal weight to underweight.

Having too much body fat is detrimental to survival, but having too little is also harmful to survival.

As you get closer to your normal weight, the response to use body fat on your own weakens.

In the case of severe obesity, body fat decreases rapidly.

As you get closer to your ideal weight, it becomes harder to lose body fat.

You cannot go down from a normal weight to underweight.

Even if one becomes underweight, there will be a response to increase body fat in order to return to a normal weight.

If you aim for underweight because of this, you need to eat less than what your body requires.

In order to do this, there are situations where you have to suppress even a normal appetite.

However, if this happens, it will lead to the absorption rate issue that was mentioned in the stagnation video series.

There is a problem of experiencing a plateau and an increase in appetite.

This causes repeated failures in dieting, leading to attempts and failures over and over again.

This is the reason why women's diets seem never-ending and continue to repeat.

However, this is only the case when the cosmetic weight is considered underweight.

Beauty weight does not necessarily have to be underweight.

As mentioned earlier, the term "beauty weight" refers to

It refers to the weight of a slim and aesthetically pleasing body, regardless of actual weight or health.

This can be interpreted in two ways.

Even if being underweight is not good for health, it can still mean a beauty weight if the body shape is good.

Being overweight, even if it is above the normal weight, can still be considered a beauty weight if the body shape is good.

Can you have a good figure even if you weigh a lot?

As shown in the video about the weight of muscle and the weight of fat,

Muscle increases weight much more than fat does.

Even if body fat is low, having a lot of muscle can result in a higher weight.

In the case of a man who has actually increased his muscle mass through exercise.

Even if someone has reduced their body fat to the point where their abs are visible and has a good figure,

Weight itself is often considered overweight due to muscle.

If a woman has a lot of muscle and low body fat, she can appear slim even if her weight is high.

On the contrary, if you have less muscle and more body fat, you may not look slim even if your weight is low.

This is referred to as "skinny fat," where the weight is that of a lean person, but the body is considered obese.

To summarize, the aesthetic weight due to being underweight is due to the issues explained earlier.

It is very difficult, hard, and painful, and if you're not careful, you could become skinny fat.

Moreover, even if you succeed in achieving a slim body, there is always a risk of experiencing weight regain.

You have to keep dieting endlessly.

On the other hand, the cosmetic weight caused by being overweight does not have these issues.

It is better to aim for a cosmetic weight that is overweight rather than underweight.

In simple terms, if it is obesity with a high amount of body fat,

By following a diet that does not include processed foods, the body should be able to reduce body fat on its own.

If you want to reach your ideal weight after reducing body fat and achieving a normal weight,

You can create a slim figure by increasing your muscle mass through exercise and a sufficient diet.

But what should I do if my body becomes too muscular from working out?

I heard that women find it difficult to build muscle.

Since I do lower body exercises, my thighs have become really thick.

They said it was just a temporary pooling of blood.

Even if I take a break from exercising for more than a week, it's still the same. Is the blood still pooled for more than a week?

There are many stories that say women, no matter how hard they exercise, do not develop muscles well.

Many women experience that the areas they exercise become thicker once they actually start working out.

It is said that the fluid has accumulated because I haven't been exercising, and that the blood has pooled and is being pumped.

In cases where it temporarily swells up like that, it should return to normal when you take a break from exercise.

Even if you take a break from exercise for more than a week, there are many cases where you don't return to your original state.

In the next video, I will discuss why this happens and what needs to be done.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

Once the second part of the beauty weight video is completed, I will make sure to have it appear on the right side.

If the video on the right is not the second part of the beauty weight video,

I am still in the process of making the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

If the video was helpful, please subscribe and like it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
