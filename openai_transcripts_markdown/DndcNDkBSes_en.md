The topic of this video is the stereotypes surrounding a balanced diet.

Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are all essential nutrients that the body needs.

Therefore, a diet that includes all three nutrients in balance is good for the body.

A diet that requires you to eat a lot of specific nutrients or prohibits certain foods is not good.

I don't think there will be anyone who opposes this statement.

I do not oppose it either.

When following a low-carb, high-fat diet, this serves as a basis for...

It is good to reduce the portion size while eating regular meals.

Eating a lot of specific nutrients is not good for your health.

But is a typical diet really a balanced diet?

Or is it the stereotypes we hold?

The nutrient ratios that can be found through a general search on the internet are

It consists of 60% carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 20% fat.

If we talk based on 1700 kcal,

60% is 1020 kcal, and since carbohydrates provide 4 kcal per gram, that amounts to 255g.

20% is 340 kcal, and since protein has 4 kcal per gram, that means 85g.

20% is 340 kcal, and since fat has 9 kcal per gram, it is approximately 38g.

To be precise, it's 37.X grams, but I'll round it up to 38g.

The common diet that we often refer to as a balanced diet is

The diet consists of 255g of carbohydrates, 85g of protein, and 38g of fat.

Is this a balanced diet?

Aren't there too many carbohydrates?

Then this time, it is a diet that includes 100g of carbohydrates, 100g of protein, and 100g of fat.

If you base it on g, it is the most balanced diet.

Carbohydrates provide 4 kcal per gram, so 100 grams contain 400 kcal.

Protein has 4 kcal per gram, so 100 grams contains 400 kcal.

Fat has 9 kcal per gram, so 100 grams is 900 kcal.

When all three are combined, it totals 1700 kcal.

The calorie ratio is 23.5% carbohydrates, 23.5% protein, and 53% fat.

This diet has more calories obtained from fat than from carbohydrates.

It will be a low-carb, high-fat diet.

However, in this video, it was mentioned that "the regular diet was not a balanced diet."

The low-carb, high-fat diet was a balanced diet. That's not what I want to talk about.

It depends on how you set the reference point.

The current content is about the balance based on g.

It changes based on kcal, and it is different when considering the amount consumed by the body.

So I don't want to claim that a low-carb, high-fat diet is a balanced diet.

Just because we call it "regular food"

Or because I have been eating that way all this time.

Believing that a balanced diet is without doubt and without evidence may be a stereotype.

If you think that a regular diet is good for health and that a regular diet is a balanced diet,

Isn't it necessary to think about why that is at least once?

Sounds plausible, right?
