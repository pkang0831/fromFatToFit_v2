Reasons why you can lose 5kg to 10kg in a week on a diet.

I received a story about how seeing other people's rapid weight loss can make someone feel anxious, so I want to discuss it.

First, let's read the content of the story.

Hello, pkang. I am a subscriber who has lost a lot of weight thanks to your videos.

I think I've lost about 20 kg over the past 6 months.

I have a concern, but it's really good.

Rapid dieting is not good, and it's said that losing about 3 to 4 kg per month is preferable.

I also lost 20kg in 6 months, so I'm losing weight at exactly that pace.

Watching videos on YouTube about losing 5kg in a week shakes my mental state.

It's a vlog video.

Recently, I've overeaten a bit and gained some weight, so I think I need to manage it.

I lost 5 kg in a week by doing one hour of fasted cardio and eating one meal a day.

It was shocking to hear that it's 5 kg in a week, not even 5 kg in a month.

Rapid dieting is not good. It's better to lose weight slowly.

I know all these stories, but still, every time I watch those videos, my mental state gets shaken.

Is there a story that can help me get my mental state together?

This is the story of such content. Let's talk about it in detail.

Weight refers to our body mass.

The weight of organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

The weight of the bones that support the body.

The weight of the water retained in the body.

And it is determined by the weight of muscle and body fat.

The weight of muscles and bones does not change significantly just because you are dieting.

If your weight has changed due to dieting.

That is because there have been changes in body water, muscle, and body fat.

The important thing here is that changes in muscle and body fat are slow.

Muscle and body fat do not increase or decrease quickly.

So what about the person who lost 5 kg in a week mentioned in the story?

There is a high possibility of changes in body water content.

Body water changes much more rapidly compared to muscle and body fat.

Eating salty food makes you feel thirsty and want to drink water.

Drinking water at this time can cause your body to swell.

Our body tries to maintain a consistent concentration of sodium.

If you eat salty food, a lot of sodium will enter your body.

This is a reaction that occurs as body water increases to lower sodium concentration.

And the carbohydrates we eat are stored in the body along with water.

When you consume a lot of carbohydrates, your body water content increases.

Water also has weight and volume.

When body water increases, body weight increases by that amount, and the body becomes thicker by that volume.

Let's remember what we've discussed so far and read the story again.

I lost 5 kg in a week by doing 1 hour of fasted cardio and eating one meal a day.

The reason I started this management in the first place was that I recently overeated and gained weight.

If you have overeaten, you naturally consume a lot of carbohydrates and sodium as well.

Most foods contain carbohydrates and sodium.

When the intake of carbohydrates and sodium increases, body water content also increases.

If body water increases, body weight will also increase.

If you exercise in this state, your body will use the stored carbohydrates as energy.

When carbohydrates are used for energy, the moisture stored with the carbohydrates is released.

After that, I do eat meals, but the amount of food I consume in one meal a day is small.

The carbohydrates consumed during exercise are not being replenished.

And since I eat only one meal a day, I naturally consume less sodium as well.

If you consume less sodium, your body will lose water to adjust the sodium concentration.

When body water is lost, body weight decreases accordingly.

So, due to overeating, the body water increases, leading to a temporarily higher weight than usual.

By reducing body water through one meal a day and exercise, if we compare the temporarily reduced weight to usual weight...

The difference may be quite noticeable, but it's hard to call this a diet.

Let's take an example to make it easier to understand.

There is a person whose usual weight is 60 kg.

Let's say I recently overate and my weight has increased to 63 kg.

In this situation, I will do one hour of fasting cardio and eat one meal a day.

If you have lost weight down to 58 kg in just a week,

If we take the increased weight of 63kg as a reference, it means that 5kg has been lost in just one week.

Based on the original weight of 60kg, it means that 2kg has been lost.

And the current weight of 58kg is under the condition of eating one meal a day.

If you stop eating one meal a day and return to your original eating habits, it is natural that your weight will increase.

As you consume more carbohydrates and sodium, your body water will increase.

As the amount of food consumed increases, the weight of the stool that stays in the colon also increases.

If you stopped eating one meal a day and gained 1kg, then the weight lost over a week would be 1kg.

If you gain 2kg, it means you haven't lost any weight over the week.

If you gain 3kg, instead of losing weight, you end up gaining 1kg instead.

I have been overeating for a long time, which has led to an increase in both body water and body fat.

If only body water is lost over the course of a week and body fat does not decrease, this can happen.

In reality, there are people who have gained body fat due to frequent gatherings for year-end parties and New Year's celebrations over the course of 2 to 3 months.

With fasted cardio and one meal a day, you can lose weight back to your original weight in 1 to 2 weeks.

I heard you succeeded in your diet, but then you stopped eating once a day.

I gained back 2 to 3 kg.

As a result, there are quite a few cases where weight has increased compared to last year.

The body fat that had increased over the past 2 to 3 months is still there.

I can't know exactly what situation the person in the story is in from the vlog video they watched, but...

If the period of overeating is long but the period of dieting is short,

The body fat gained during the period of overeating remains as it is.

It is highly likely that the decrease in the number on the scale is due to loss of body water.

If the period of overeating is short and the period of dieting is also short,

It is likely that there has been little change in body fat, and that only body water has increased and then decreased.

It's not a video that someone who needs to actually reduce body fat should refer to.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

The first weight is the weight of organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

The weight of the bones that support the body.

It is determined by the weight of body water, muscle, and body fat.

The weight of the second organ and the weight of the bones change little even if you are on a diet.

If you have lost weight through dieting, it means that your body water, muscle, and body fat have changed.

The third muscle and body fat change slowly.

If your weight has changed in a short period of time, it is mostly due to changes in body water.

I can organize it like this.

No matter which diet method you choose, it takes time for body fat to decrease.

If you lose weight in a short period of time, most of that weight loss is water.

When I hear stories like "I lost 5kg in a week" or "I lost 10kg,"

Focusing on the lost weight.

"I wish I could be like that too." You shouldn't think like this.

Removing water in the first place is not dieting.

Body fat cannot be lost at the same rate as body water.

Compared to the rate at which body water is lost, it's hard not to be disappointed.

It's natural for your mental state to be shaken.

Instead of focusing on the weight lost, focus on the time lost.

"If you've lost weight in just a week, it means you've likely lost water weight." This is how you should think about it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

I also tried dieting with one meal a day, but I kept experiencing yo-yo effects.

They say it's because your body becomes prone to gaining weight if you eat less.

If that's the case, shouldn't it be that if you eat a lot, it should be difficult to gain weight?

Yes, that's right. There is actually such a mechanism.

There was a question about this in the past, so I made a video to answer it.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

When you watch YouTube videos or see celebrities, you can clearly see a difference even with just a 5kg weight loss.

Losing 10 kg seems to change a person.

I lost 10 kg, but there isn't much difference.

Why is this happening?

It's due to the blindness to change and the rate of change.

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a detailed explanation video about it.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right.

If you're curious about this part, you can click here to see it.

I only eat about half a bowl of rice, but I still gain weight.

I can't reduce my food intake any further, and I don't know how to diet.

In the case of men, such stories are not common.

In the case of women, they say that even if they eat less, they don't lose weight.

There is a saying that you can gain weight even if you eat little.

This is because the body fat that accumulates varies by gender.

I explained it in detail in another video.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

It is said that due to homeostasis, which aims to maintain a stable weight, dieting often leads to a yo-yo effect.

How can I break this homeostasis?

You should utilize it rather than trying to break the homeostasis.

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
