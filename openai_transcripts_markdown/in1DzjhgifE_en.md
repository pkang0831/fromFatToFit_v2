Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video on lower body obesity.

In part 1 of the video, we talked about lower body obesity in people who weigh a lot.

In the second part of the video, we talked about people who have a normal weight but are experiencing lower body obesity.

Since the content in the previous video is all connected, it is recommended that those who haven't watched it go and do so.

A video link is displayed in the upper right corner, and if you click on it, you can watch the previous video.

If you have watched parts 1 and 2, you would know what the causes of lower body obesity are.

You must have understood that exercising is also part of solving that issue.

The muscles mentioned in Part 1 related to body weight and the muscles in the front of the thigh mentioned in Part 2.

There are cases where people hesitate to exercise because they are afraid of losing weight due to it.

However, even if you exercise, that muscle will still decrease.

Muscles develop the more you use them, and they deteriorate the less you use them.

So, by increasing the intensity or duration of exercise, if you increase the total load on the muscles, the muscles will grow.

Conversely, if you exercise less intensely or for a shorter duration, the total load on the muscles decreases, which can lead to muscle loss.

The weight-bearing muscles that develop to move a heavy body and the front thigh muscles that have developed due to poor posture are

For a short period, there is a load for 4 to 5 hours, and for a longer period, it can exceed 10 hours continuously.

This is muscle developed from the total amount of load.

However, for the average person who is not an athlete, consistently exercising for 1 to 2 hours a day is not easy.

Even if you exercise consistently, you don't just work out one specific muscle group, right?

So, no matter how hard an average person exercises,

You cannot exceed the total amount of strain from 4 to 10 hours caused by daily weight and poor posture.

So just because you exercise, it doesn't mean that the muscles responsible for creating lower body obesity, as mentioned in parts 1 and 2, will grow larger.

Rather, if you exercise hard to lose weight and improve your posture,

The load that was caused by weight and posture disappears, right?

So actively exercising is

The fastest way to reduce the muscles that cause lower body obesity.

I have very thick calves and struggle with lower body obesity. Can this be resolved with consistent exercise?

In the second part of the video, we talked about how poor posture can lead to a reduction in the abdominal and glute muscles.

The abdominal muscles and gluteal muscles are the muscles located at the center of the human body.

When the core muscles weaken, balance becomes disrupted.

When balance is disrupted, the body tilts with every step.

In the process of supporting a tilting body and regaining balance, the calf muscles are used extensively.

Since I use my muscles a lot, my calf muscles have developed excessively.

As a result, the calves become too thick.

In a wrestling match where a competitor loses if any part of their body above the knee touches the ground,

The calf muscles are very important for maintaining balance, even when it is disrupted, and for regaining it.

So, if you look at the calf muscles of a wrestling athlete, you can see that they are incredibly well-developed.

So, by strengthening the core muscles, including the abdominal and gluteal muscles, you can maintain proper posture and balance.

As the calf muscles are used less, they begin to shrink.

The calves are gradually becoming thinner.

In the case of lower body obesity with thick calves, there is one important thing to keep in mind when exercising.

Before the posture is corrected, the abdominal and gluteal muscles need to be well developed.

It is advisable to refrain from walking or running exercises as much as possible.

The reason why the calf muscles have become excessively developed in the first place is...

Because the core muscles, such as the abdominal muscles and gluteal muscles, are weak.

Every time I walk, my balance is disrupted, and this is because I use my calf muscles to correct that balance.

If you engage in walking or running exercises without proper balance in your body,

While exercising, my body tilts, and I end up using my calf muscles to correct it.

And even after the workout, you continue to use your calf muscles while walking around.

In this case, starting to exercise could lead to thicker calves.

I actually started exercising to lose weight.

When you exercise by walking or running without paying attention to your body's posture.

Many women are quite concerned about their calves becoming thicker.

So first, through exercises that build muscle, we create the correct posture.

It is advisable to engage in walking or running exercises after your body has achieved proper balance.

Sounds plausible, right?
