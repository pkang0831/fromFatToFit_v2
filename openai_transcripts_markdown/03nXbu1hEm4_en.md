The topic of this video is about fat-burning foods and what happens when you eat them together with fat.

A question like the following was posted in the comments.

For health, I make sure to take in unsaturated fats like omega-3 and almonds every day.

I am taking lemon balm, powdered puer tea, and cacao nibs, which are fat-burning foods, for my diet.

However, when these two are eaten together,

I am curious whether fat-dissolving foods break down subcutaneous fat and visceral fat, or if they only break down unsaturated fat.

To get straight to the point,

Eating fat-burning foods and unsaturated fat foods together will not cancel each other out and disappear.

There was a time when it was popular to say that eating vinegar makes the body more flexible.

It was not simply regarded as a story from the internet; it was considered almost a fact.

So, for professions that require flexibility, like dancers and gymnasts, they intentionally drink a large amount of vinegar every day.

A special documentary aired on TV explaining why drinking vinegar makes the body more flexible.

Let me tell you about the experiment that was featured in the documentary.

Place an egg in vinegar.

After a certain amount of time has passed, if you take out the eggs...

The originally hard eggshell becomes soft and pliable.

Next, put a human bone in the vinegar.

As expected, if you take it out after a certain amount of time, the bones become soft and tender.

This experiment shows that vinegar has the power to soften hard eggs and bones.

Therefore, it is said that eating vinegar makes the muscles and bones softer and increases flexibility.

This story was popular from 2007 to 2008.

In the second half of 2008, opposing theories began to emerge.

The opposing argument is that vinegar consumed orally is broken down in the digestive system and absorbed as nutrients.

It is not directly sprayed on the muscles and bones.

In other words, eating vinegar and soaking bones in vinegar are completely different things.

It sounds like a very obvious statement now.

At that time, I couldn't think like this and I really believed that eating vinegar would make me more flexible.

It's similar to the superstition that eating tiger meat makes you brave like a tiger.

Even now, if you search the internet, you'll find many stories saying that drinking vinegar doesn't make you flexible.

Since then, when discussing the benefits of food, we focus on the components within the food.

For foods that break down fat, promote weight loss, and burn fat to be effective,

It is not just about breaking down fat in the same area.

What nutrients are contained in the food?

This nutrient affects our body's metabolism, which means it should help burn subcutaneous fat and visceral fat.

So when consumed with unsaturated fats, it will not break down the unsaturated fats.

If there are foods that help break down fat when eaten together,

This food must have become much more famous for its digestive benefits.

It is a food that helps break down fat when eaten with greasy foods, preventing weight gain.

Such food cannot help but be famous.

So I think the issue that the questioner is worried about is unlikely to happen.

Sounds plausible, right?
