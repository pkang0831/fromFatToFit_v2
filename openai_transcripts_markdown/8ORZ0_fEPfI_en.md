Drinking water makes you feel full, reducing your meal portions? - Water Diet Part 2

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the second video about the water diet.

In the first video, we talked about cold water.

In this video, I would like to discuss the claim that drinking water creates a feeling of fullness, which can aid in dieting.

Drinking water fills the stomach with water, creating a feeling of fullness.

The claim is that if the feeling of fullness reduces the amount of food consumed, it leads to weight loss.

In fact, when I had them drink 500ml of water before meals,

There are also experiments that show a decrease in meal quantity and that dieting has occurred.

Then drinking water creates a feeling of fullness, which reduces meal portions and leads to weight loss.

This claim is correct, isn't it?

It's not completely wrong, but it's a bit different.

What are the causes of obesity?

In the video about how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods, I talked about it in detail.

When you eat processed foods, too much insulin hormone is secreted.

Due to too much insulin, appetite increases.

This increased appetite is the reason why I eat food often and in large quantities.

When you eat food, you feel full and should stop eating, but...

The problem arose due to increased appetite caused by insulin.

If a person like this drinks water and feels full, will their food intake decrease?

Unfortunately, that's not the case.

The system that makes you feel full and stop eating is malfunctioning in the first place.

There is an experiment that shows drinking water before a meal reduces the amount of food consumed, right?

Yes, that's right.

However, that doesn't mean it's because the stomach is filled with water and feeling full.

In diet experiments, it's rare to conduct them while eating chicken or pizza.

Most experiments are conducted in the form of a diet.

Let's check what happens when we drink additional water here.

So, after I drank water, I felt full, and my food intake decreased.

This should not be interpreted this way.

By reducing the intake of processed foods, normalize your appetite.

When you feel full, you reach a state where you can stop eating.

I heard that drinking water has led to a decrease in meal portions.

Anyway, it's true that drinking water reduces meal portions and helps with dieting.

Is it really necessary to know that in such detail?

Yes, there is.

If you are completely unaware of this information,

I found that drinking water reduced my meal portions, which helped me lose weight.

If you understand it this way,

There are cases where people eat fatty foods as they are while only drinking water.

In this case, there will obviously be no weight loss effect.

Rather, I feel full from drinking water, and with my increased appetite, I end up forcing myself to eat more.

The stomach may expand more, which could become a problem.

Why does the amount of food consumed decrease when drinking water in a state where appetite is normal?

There are two main reasons.

The first reason is that you may confuse thirst with hunger.

It is said that the human body is made up of 70% water.

This water evaporates even when it is still.

Because it is also lost through tears, saliva, sweat, urine, and feces.

You need to continue to supplement it.

There is also a way to replenish by drinking water.

You can supplement even after eating food.

The food we eat contains moisture.

As a result, there are situations where, in need of water, one can feel both thirst and hunger.

If you drink a lot of water, this feeling of hunger will go away.

In that case, the amount of food consumed will naturally decrease.

The second reason is that most people do not know the right portion size for themselves.

In modern society,

If I don't intentionally try to avoid it, I have no choice but to eat processed food.

Eating processed foods increases appetite, leading to overeating.

If I continue this lifestyle, I will lose track of the right amount of food for me.

I have always overeaten.

So I don't want to overeat, and my appetite has returned to normal.

There are quite a few times when I unknowingly overeat.

As mentioned in the satiety series,

The way to find a meal plan that suits me is to start by eating less.

If you feel satisfied and full even after eating a little, then there’s no need to eat a lot.

When you drink water and your stomach is somewhat full, you tend to eat less food.

If you are satisfied with eating less, your meal portions will decrease afterward.

The reason for the reduced meal quantity in the experiment shown at the beginning of the video is because of this.

So, let's normalize the appetite.

So, if you drink water afterwards, it reduces your meal portion, which helps with dieting, right?

What kind of food should I eat to normalize my appetite?

That topic was discussed in detail in the section about how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and those that help you lose weight.

I will make sure to put the video link in the top right.

If you're curious, you can click to see.

In the first part of the video, you mentioned that drinking cold water doesn't lead to weight loss.

I've heard that drinking warm water can help you lose weight.

Is this a true story?

In the next video, I will talk about warm water.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the water diet,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
