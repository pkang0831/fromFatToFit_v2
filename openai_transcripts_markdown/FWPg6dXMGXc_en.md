Hello, this is pkang.

This is the eighth video about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In Part 1 of the video, the types of low-carb, high-fat diets are discussed.

In the second part of the video, a strange low-carb, high-fat diet is created by mixing two different meal plans.

In Part 3 of the video, we will discuss refined foods and unrefined foods.

In Part 4 of the video, a balanced diet is discussed.

In the fifth video, the amount of food that is good for dieting.

In the sixth video, we discuss low-carbohydrate diets and insulin.

In the seventh video, we talked about low-carb diets and exercise.

In this video, we will discuss the topic, "Will we never be able to eat processed foods for life?"

You need to watch it in order from Part 1 to understand the content without any misunderstandings.

For those who haven't watched Part 1, the playlist link is available in the top right corner.

By clicking, you can watch the videos in order starting from Part 1.

In a typical diet plan, there are foods that are considered to be the causes of obesity.

They say that you should eat this food less or not eat it again.

A diet that considers carbohydrates to be the cause of obesity has a rule to eat less carbohydrates for a lifetime.

A diet that considers fat to be the cause of obesity has a rule to eat less fat for a lifetime.

Even in Pelio, which believes that refined foods are the cause of obesity, there is a rule to avoid eating refined foods for a lifetime.

However, the pkang diet does not prohibit the consumption of refined foods for a lifetime.

If you've been watching the video from Part 1, you might feel that the pkang diet and the Pelio diet are similar.

This is where the differences arise. That's why the Paleo diet and the LCHF diet are different.

So far, I have been discussing that the cause of obesity is refined foods.

If you misunderstand this statement, you might think that eating even a little bit of processed food will lead to obesity.

However, eating a small amount of processed food does not immediately lead to obesity.

Processed foods disrupt the body's metabolism, creating false hunger.

Because of this false hunger, I eat more processed foods.

The body's metabolism is disrupted by more processed foods, leading to a more intense false hunger.

Due to this, the vicious cycle of eating more processed foods leads to increasing obesity.

So, eating processed foods doesn't immediately lead to obesity.

The result of living a lifestyle that involves eating a lot of processed foods for a long time is obesity.

Reducing the intake of refined foods and following a diet of unrefined foods while exercising is

It is an action to eliminate false hunger and restore the body's metabolism to normal.

If your body's metabolism has returned to normal, eating processed foods won't immediately ruin it.

Even if you eat processed foods, you will develop a defense mechanism that helps prevent obesity.

In actual success stories about dieting, there are mentions of having become a body type that doesn't gain weight.

What this means is that before starting a diet, consuming refined foods easily led to an increase in body fat.

I lost weight by following a proper diet and exercising.

It means that even if you eat processed foods, your body fat does not increase.

When the body becomes healthy, this defensive ability develops.

When you develop immunity, it means that even if you eat processed foods, your body will be protected from becoming obese.

Of course, the defensive capability is not infinite.

If you live a lifestyle of eating a lot of processed foods for a long time, your metabolism will eventually break down and lead to obesity.

However, if you do not continue to eat consistently, you can sufficiently prevent it.

And how can one live a lifetime without eating processed food?

Sometimes you need to have a beer with chicken, and after a big event, you also need to have a company dinner.

When you travel, you should try the local food.

The reason for recommending an unrefined food diet in the Longo diet is

Processed foods are the cause of obesity, so it's not about saying, "Never eat them again! Forbidden!"

The goal is to create a body that is okay with occasionally eating processed foods when I want to.

You said that just eating processed food doesn't immediately lead to obesity.

Sometimes when I eat refined foods on a cheat day, my weight increases significantly.

The refined foods we commonly eat contain a high amount of carbohydrates.

When refined carbohydrates are supplied in large amounts to the body, excess carbohydrates are stored in the body.

When carbohydrates are stored in the body, they are stored along with water.

So when carbohydrates are stored in excess in the body, water is also stored in excess.

Your weight will increase by the amount of weight of the excess stored water.

Although my weight has increased, it is due to an increase in water rather than body fat.

If you eat unrefined food again,

Excess stored carbohydrates and water will be lost, and you will return to your original weight within a few days.

What food did you eat? How much did you eat? And there are differences depending on a person's constitution.

It usually takes about 2 to 3 days to return to normal.

So, the pkang diet consists of eating unrefined foods.

It's about eating enough of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins without lacking any of them.

However, if you take care to eat carbohydrates, fats, and proteins well, can you still lose weight?

If there is nothing lacking, how can body fat decrease?

In the next video, I will talk about this question.

There should be two videos on the screen right now. Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the low-carb high-fat part 9 video, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
