I used to be obese because I ate a lot... but now I'm worried because I'm eating too little.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

In the past, I used to eat a lot and was obese.

Right now, I'm actually worried because I'm eating too little.

I received a story like this, so I would like to talk about it.

First, let's read the story.

Hello, I'm a subscriber of pkang.

Since I changed my diet method after watching your video, I am experiencing a whole new world.

In the past, even when I was hungry, I tried to endure it, eat less, and move around a lot.

I always failed at dieting while doing that.

It's amazing that you can eat until you're full without resisting hunger and still lose weight.

My appetite has decreased a lot, and I haven't overeaten at all in the past year.

In the past, I used to eat until my stomach was completely full, but now I don't feel the desire to do that anymore.

I'm worried that I might be eating too little.

I calculated the calories of the food I eat in a day, and it comes to about 600 to 700 kcal.

If you don't feel hungry even when you eat less, it's because your body is obtaining energy by reducing body fat.

There is no need to force yourself to eat.

I have seen videos with this kind of content as well.

I am in a situation where I have lost enough weight.

There is still a bit of excess fat, but my stomach has really slimmed down a lot.

My BMI has gone from obese to normal.

However, I still eat a small amount.

So I'm worried that this might lower my basal metabolic rate.

Is it okay to eat this little?

This is the story with such content.

Let's talk in detail.

To understand the concerns of the story, a little explanation is needed.

The cause of obesity is overeating, which means eating too much food.

So, what are the causes of overeating?

It is a desire to eat a lot of food.

Many people consider their appetite to be a unique characteristic of themselves.

So I originally like sweet foods. I usually say that I eat a lot.

To diet, you should avoid overeating and consuming large amounts of food.

Therefore, people with a strong appetite think they have to force themselves to suppress their cravings.

However, in reality, it is not like that.

The human body is regulated by hormones.

When insulin hormone is released, it stores body fat.

When glucagon hormone is released, it consumes body fat.

When the ghrelin hormone is released, you feel hungry.

When the leptin hormone is released, you feel full.

The food we eat affects our bodies.

When the body is affected, changes occur in hormone metabolism.

If the food I eat changes my hormonal metabolism to increase my appetite,

I want to eat more food, more often.

This can also be expressed as an increased appetite or a stronger craving for food.

In reality, you don't need food, but you feel hungry because of hormones.

It is also referred to as false hunger.

So the desire to eat a lot is not an inherent trait that I originally possess.

It could be that it looks like the food I eat.

In that case, let's change the types of food we eat.

It is also possible to normalize appetite so that you don't want to eat a lot.

This is the key to dieting.

In this case, the desire to eat a lot will disappear.

I want to eat more, but I have to hold back and just eat a little.

You can feel satisfied even without eating a lot.

In fact, the person who shared their story used to eat so much food that they became obese.

Now, I'm satisfied with eating about 600 to 700 kcal a day.

If you look at the comments on my video, there are quite a few people like this.

The problem is that I'm now worried because I'm eating too little.

Isn't it good if you can eat less, feel satisfied, and not be hungry, making it easier to diet?

What are you worried about?

It's a concern about yo-yos.

If you lose weight by starving yourself, your basal metabolic rate decreases.

When the basal metabolic rate decreases, it becomes easier to gain weight, leading to a yo-yo effect.

If you're someone interested in dieting, you've probably heard this story at least once.

In reality, the energy supplied to my body is too low.

If the energy consumed by the body does not match the balance,

To achieve this balance, several reactions occur.

One of the reactions is that the basal metabolic rate decreases.

However, there is a reaction that occurs before the basal metabolic rate decreases.

I'm hungry.

Eating less does not necessarily mean that your basal metabolic rate decreases.

First, a response that encourages eating more food occurs.

If you eat more food, the energy supplied to your body increases, and this helps maintain balance.

If you lose weight by starving yourself, it means that your basal metabolic rate decreases.

I'm hungry and want to eat more food.

If you don't force yourself to eat this,

Since we cannot increase the energy supplied to the body,

You will try to balance by reducing the energy you consume.

In the process of reducing energy consumption, the basal metabolic rate decreases.

However, I am eating less now, but I am not hungry.

That means the balance is in a state of equilibrium.

If you are clearly eating less food but still maintaining balance, then we should consider that there is another source of energy.

It is body fat.

When you obtain energy from body fat, you don't need to get that much from food.

So that's why I don't feel hungry even when I eat less.

The majority of people who are on a diet are obese with a high body fat percentage.

So that's why I made a video with this content.

However, the person in question has lost enough body fat to no longer be considered obese.

So I'm worried that there might be a problem since I don't fall into that category.

If you are not obese and you don't feel hungry even when you eat less,

In this case, it is correct that the basal metabolic rate is low.

However, it's not that the basal metabolic rate is decreasing from now on; it is already in a low state.

If the energy obtained is too low compared to the energy consumed, the balance will not be right.

You mentioned that a reaction occurs to maintain balance.

First, hunger arises, prompting one to eat more food.

If that's not possible, I will try to reduce the energy I consume as much as I can.

But right now, I wasn't hungry in the first place.

It means that the basal metabolic rate has already decreased.

I used to do a starvation diet, and during that time, my basal metabolic rate decreased, but it hasn't recovered.

I have too little activity in my daily life.

If you diet only through your diet without exercising, this can often happen.

Instead of worrying that your basal metabolic rate might decrease,

In order to raise the already lowered basal metabolic rate, it is necessary to exercise.

To summarize what has been discussed so far,

The first cause of obesity is overeating, and the cause of overeating is a high appetite.

The second person's body is regulated by hormones.

High appetite is a result of hormonal metabolism.

The third thing is that the food we eat affects our bodies.

Because hormone metabolism changes as a result.

Eating foods that increase appetite can lead to stronger cravings, resulting in overeating and obesity.

Therefore, to lose weight, it is necessary to change the types of food you eat in order to normalize your appetite.

When the fourth appetite becomes normal, you will feel hunger when you need food.

If you feel full even after eating little and have no desire to eat more,

You are either obtaining energy from body fat or your basal metabolic rate has already decreased.

If your basal metabolic rate has decreased, it is advisable to increase it through exercise.

It can be organized like this.

To normalize your appetite and feel satisfied even when eating less,

What kind of food should I eat?

In a video explaining the principles of dieting, I talked about it in detail before.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click here to see it.

I exercise every day, but I am in a similar situation as the person who shared their story.

What could be the problem with me?

There may be issues with the way you are exercising.

To increase your basal metabolic rate, you need to increase your muscle mass through exercise.

To achieve that, you need to exercise using a progressive overload method.

As muscle mass increases through exercise, it becomes easier to exercise.

As the exercise becomes easier, let's increase the intensity a bit more.

As the intensity increases, the muscle mass also increases.

If you continue to repeat the same intensity of exercise without this process,

It may not be effective.

I recently made a video explaining why repeating exercises of the same intensity is ineffective.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
