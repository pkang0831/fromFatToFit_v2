A person who can't sleep without having a late-night snack - How to resist late-night snacking Part 2

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the second video about late-night snacks.

In the last video, we talked about cases where people end up eating late-night snacks due to dietary habits.

In this video, I would like to talk about late-night snacks caused by sleep disorders.

Our body has a sympathetic nervous system and a parasympathetic nervous system.

Simply put, the sympathetic nervous system refers to the process of tensing the body.

The parasympathetic nervous system refers to the state of relaxation and the body's process of easing tension.

When engaging in intense activities like exercise, the body tenses up and the sympathetic nervous system becomes active.

On the contrary, when you rest and sleep, the parasympathetic nervous system becomes active.

When we eat food, the digestive process activates the parasympathetic nervous system.

Because of this, there are times when I feel sleepy after eating.

This is what we call post-lunch drowsiness.

Among those who cannot sleep due to sleep disorders,

There are quite a few cases where people take advantage of this post-lunch drowsiness to sleep.

Once you get used to it, it becomes a natural thing to eat a late-night snack and go to bed even when you're not hungry.

In such cases, commonly known methods for reducing appetite and stopping late-night snacking often prove ineffective.

For example, reduce the intake of processed foods.

Eat enough for dinner so that you won't be hungry before going to bed.

If you really want a late-night snack, try eating just a little bit of something light.

Late-night snacks are a habit, so try to force yourself to sleep without eating.

These methods are ineffective.

It's not that I'm eating a late-night snack because I'm hungry in the first place; it's because I'm eating to go to sleep.

Even if I'm not hungry before going to bed

I can't sleep if I don't eat a late-night snack, so I want to have a late-night snack.

You need to eat a lot to feel full because that’s when drowsiness hits you hard.

It is often difficult to eat even a little bit of light food.

Even if I try to go to bed without having a late-night snack, it's hard to fall asleep.

Even if I force myself to sleep, I wake up in the middle of the night to eat a late-night snack and then go back to sleep.

In order to sleep in the first place, the parasympathetic nervous system needs to be activated.

The problem is that I am eating late-night snacks that way.

So we need to find a way to activate the parasympathetic nervous system without late-night snacks to solve this problem.

The first thing you need to do for that is

You need to stop playing games, watching videos, and using social media right before you go to bed.

Many people play games, watch videos on OTT services, or use social media right up until they go to bed.

However, this game, video viewing, and social media provide a lot of stimulation to the visual and auditory senses.

As the body responds to this strong stimulus, it experiences excitement and tension.

In this case, the sympathetic nervous system becomes activated, and then the parasympathetic nervous system cannot be activated.

However, there are also people who fall asleep while playing games or using social media.

When you watch space documentary videos on YouTube,

Many people said they fell asleep while watching that video.

Why are these people like that?

It is because there is no tension or excitement.

It's easier to understand when explained using a book as an example.

It's often said that reading a book makes you sleepy.

When I actually read difficult books related to studying, I often feel sleepy right away.

However, in the case of an interesting novel, I can read for hours without getting bored.

The act of reading a book itself is the same, but...

Why do different reactions occur depending on the book being read?

The act of reading a book is judged by the brain to determine whether it is meaningful or not.

Basically, reading a book is an activity that consumes a considerable amount of energy.

You need to interpret and understand the shape of the letters you see with your eyes through language.

You need to imagine and recall the content of the book you understood.

When food is mentioned in the book, it evokes the taste and aroma of the food.

When the protagonist of the book is in a crisis, I sometimes feel tense or excited along with them.

In the process of being so immersed, various parts of the brain are used and a lot of energy is consumed.

From the brain's perspective, if it exerts this much effort, it naturally expects a reward.

You should either gain knowledge by understanding the content of the book or at least find it entertaining.

So, even if it's a book related to studying...

A book that I can understand and gain knowledge from.

If it's a novel that I enjoy reading,

You may not feel sleepy.

However, the content of the book is too complex and difficult for me to understand.

So if you can't gain anything, drowsiness will overwhelm you.

The brain is doing a lot of work, but since I can't understand the content of the book, I gain nothing.

Then, I feel like there is no reward.

Since there is no reward, the energy consumed while reading a book is wasted.

It's like a signal to stop that waste.

The same goes for gaming, watching videos, and social media.

This also uses a significant part of the brain.

If there are rewards such as interest and fun,

To eliminate drowsiness so that I can focus better.

On the contrary, without any rewards, drowsiness will set in.

So even when watching the same space documentary video,

If you usually have an interest in space and understand the content of the video, you will wake up.

On the contrary, those who are not interested in space and do not understand the content of the video will fall asleep.

If a game is fun, you want to keep playing it.

On the contrary, when a game becomes boring, it gradually makes you sleepy.

If I find interesting and fun posts on social media, it keeps me awake.

On the contrary, if I have no interest or keep seeing posts that I've already seen, I gradually become more and more bored.

The problem is that games, videos, and social media are all created for entertainment.

Therefore, if I am not in a situation where I am tired and my comprehension is diminished or my motivation is extremely low,

Most people find it enjoyable.

Many people try to sleep when they feel sleepy while playing games, watching videos, or using social media.

When it gets late at night and it's time to sleep, there are times when I try to turn it off right away and go to bed.

Because the sympathetic nervous system is activated due to tension and excitement,

Of course, it's difficult to sleep.

So you need to stop gaming, watching videos, and using social media at least 30 minutes before your bedtime.

In that way, I relax my body and calm my excitement.

You need to give time for the parasympathetic nervous system to be activated.

Make the surroundings quiet and dark to reduce external stimuli.

You need to breathe deeply and slowly to relax your body as much as possible.

By doing this, at least until just before going to bed, it is better than playing games, watching videos, or using social media.

You can sleep a little easier.

If we summarize the content of the video in five points, it would be:

The first person's body has both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.

To sleep, the parasympathetic nervous system must be activated.

When you eat the second meal, the parasympathetic nervous system is activated for digestion.

Because of this, you may feel drowsy after eating, which is known as postprandial somnolence.

In the third game, watching videos and using social media activate the sympathetic nervous system.

This makes it difficult to sleep.

Eating a late-night snack can help you fall asleep due to drowsiness.

If you keep eating late-night snacks and then sleeping due to drowsiness,

It's hard to sleep without a late-night snack.

Therefore, even if I'm not hungry, I end up eating a late-night snack for myself.

This is referred to as late-night snacking due to sleep disorders.

Often, the cause is engaging in games, watching videos, or using social media right up until the fifth self.

It is advisable to stop playing games, watching videos, and using social media at least 30 minutes before going to sleep.

I can organize it like this.

Eating late-night snacks is not good for dieting either, but

If you don't get enough sleep, it can lead to weight gain.

It is advisable to address sleep disorders.

For reference, the causes of sleep disorders are very diverse.

If you find it hard to fall asleep even after stopping gaming, watching videos, and using social media,

Getting counseling for insomnia is also a good idea.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

You mentioned that not getting enough sleep can lead to weight gain.

So, if you have insomnia, can you gain weight even if you don't eat late-night snacks?

That's right.

If you don't get enough sleep, you can gain weight even without eating.

There was a comment asking for more detailed information about sleep and dieting in the past.

I made a video that explains in detail about sleep and dieting.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have videos about sleep and dieting appear in the top left.

If you're curious about this, you can click and take a look.

In the last video, you mentioned that the reasons for eating late-night snacks are dietary habits, sleep disorders, and habits, which are three factors.

In the last video, I talked about eating habits.

In this video, we talked about sleep disorders.

In the next video, will you be talking about late-night snack habits?

I'm worried because eating late-night snacks has become a habit for me.

In the next video, we will discuss the reasons why late-night snacking habits develop and

I will talk about the solution to that.

Once the next video is completed, I plan to have it appear in the upper right corner.

If the video does not appear in the upper right corner,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
