The topic of this video is the revealing clothing of sexual violence victims.

I will talk about whether it has been a cause of sexual violence crimes.

In early 2018, in the city of Brussels, Belgium.

I heard that an exhibition displaying the clothes of sexual violence victims has been held.

The purpose of holding the exhibition is

Dressing in revealing clothing has an effect of provoking sexual violence crimes.

Therefore, there is a perception that wearing revealing clothing is responsible for sexual violence crimes.

It's not that I think that way.

It is said to be an exhibition that proves that such perceptions are incorrect.

I looked at the clothes at the exhibition, and while there are some outfits that are quite revealing,

It is said that there were also many very ordinary clothes that were not revealing at all.

Sexual violence crimes do not only occur with revealing clothing.

It is a mistaken perception that sexual violence occurs because of revealing clothing.

It is said to be an exhibition that proves this.

While sharing this story with an acquaintance,

Results of the 2016 Sexual Violence Survey on SNS

54% of men and 44% of women responded to the question that sexual violence occurs because of revealing clothing.

They say they answered yes.

About 50% of the people responded "yes."

I was surprised to hear that this is being made into a card news format and spreading on social media.

I have thought about why people have this perception.

First, let me mention one absolute truth.

Regardless of what clothes the victim was wearing

Whether wearing revealing clothes or being completely naked,

This does not give the perpetrator the right to commit sexual violence against the victim.

This is such an obvious statement.

When a sexual violence crime occurs, the responsibility lies 100% with the perpetrator.

There are no opposing views on this part, but where opinions differ is in the following areas.

So, if we ask whether revealing clothing is completely unrelated to sexual violence crimes, then...

Regarding this, people seem to think, "Hmm... well... it seems like there might be a connection?"

I don't have a clear reason for why I feel this way.

If it is related, then you shouldn't wear clothes like that.

Wearing clothes like that is what causes sexual violence crimes.

In that case, one might start to think that there is some responsibility for it, leading to confusion and misconceptions.

I will talk about why I have these thoughts and why this is an illusion.

Some people argue that there is no connection at all between sexual violence crimes and clothing.

There is indeed a connection.

In what way is it related?

The perpetrator chooses a specific victim among many targets to commit the crime.

And in the process of making a choice, unconscious factors such as clothing can come into play.

To help with understanding, for example,

Among the psychological tests that analyze human psychology, there is a house drawing psychological test.

If you give someone a sketchbook and say, "Please draw a house,"

I asked you to draw a house, but there are so many different types of houses, right?

There will be houses like apartments, and there will be houses with pointed roofs.

There will be houses with chimneys and houses without chimneys.

Among these various shapes of houses, I unconsciously choose a specific house to draw.

There may be a window at home, there may be several, or there may be none at all. This is also a choice.

You may choose not to draw a door at home, or you can draw one door or several doors; this is also a choice.

You can fill the sketchbook completely with your drawings, or you can draw something small in the corner.

You can draw it in the center even when drawing small, or you can draw it in the corner.

You can draw just one house or multiple houses.

There are cases where there is a fence and cases where there isn't.

I unconsciously choose from so many elements to draw a house.

The drawing I created reflects my psychology, so it can be used to analyze my mental state.

However, this can also be used for crime.

When a criminal chooses a victim, they do so unconsciously.

You will choose the image of the victim that you prefer.

From that perspective, the victim's clothing can influence their choices.

In fact, there are investigative techniques that analyze the psychology of such perpetrators to catch the criminals.

Profiling - Evidence left at the scene. It is an investigative method that analyzes the pattern of the crime to identify the psychological state or tendencies of the perpetrator and to create a profile of the offender.

There are techniques that analyze what type of victim a criminal preferred and what crime scene they favored in order to catch them.

In fact, we are using this to catch a lot of criminals.

If we say that clothing has nothing to do with crime, then profiling becomes meaningless.

From this perspective, it could be related.

However, with the fact that there is a connection.

Yeah, I knew you would say that. It's like saying I shouldn't have worn such revealing clothes.

There are people who blame the victim, but that's not the case.

What would you do if the element preferred by the perpetrator is something other than clothing?

A sexual violence crime has occurred, and I have profiled the perpetrator.

Let's consider that the perpetrator prefers a vocal cord that is wearing pants.

In that case, the perpetrator may have considered the factor of whether the victim was wearing pants during the process of choosing the victim.

Whether consciously or unconsciously

And to put it extremely...

The victim can say that they experienced sexual violence because they were wearing pants.

However, that doesn't mean we can tell the victim, "You should have worn a skirt; why were you wearing pants?"

It's a nonsensical question.

What if the perpetrator preferred short hair?

Are you going to ask the victim, "Why didn't you grow your hair long? Why did you cut it short?"

What if the perpetrator preferred a victim who appeared weak enough not to resist while committing the crime?

You can't say to the victim, "Why do you look weak? You should look strong."

With the same concept

Just because the perpetrator preferred victims who were dressed in revealing clothing...

You shouldn't say to the victim, "Why were you wearing such revealing clothes? You shouldn't have done that."

So to summarize,

It is possible to think that revealing clothing may be related to sexual violence crimes.

In reality, there is something called profiling.

If the criminal preferred that kind of clothing, then it must be related.

However, it is important not to mistakenly think that the victim has any fault or responsibility just because of that.
