If you exercise like this, you won't lose weight - Reasons for not losing weight Part 2

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the second video about the reasons why you're not losing weight.

In the first video, we talked about cases where there are issues with the diet.

In this video, I would like to talk about exercise.

Exercise can be divided into those who have just started working out and those who do it consistently.

If you have just started exercising,

Due to the phenomenon of moisture retention.

There are quite a few cases where weight does not decrease or even increases.

What is the phenomenon of moisture retention?

It is a phenomenon where body water increases due to exercise.

When we exercise, our muscles sustain tiny injuries.

In the process of healing this injury, the muscles grow larger and physical abilities improve.

However, when a person's body is injured, there is a phenomenon where moisture accumulates.

When you injure the muscles in your body through exercise, it leads to an increase in body water.

The purpose of dieting is to reduce body fat.

Therefore, even if body water increases, if body fat decreases, it means that weight is being lost.

As the volume of body water increases, the body becomes thicker.

If your weight increases by the same amount as the increase in body water weight,

I am not losing weight. Or you might think that I am gaining weight.

So, saying "I actually gain weight when I exercise,"

There are many cases where people intentionally do not exercise.

When you first start exercising, you experience significant muscle soreness, but...

If you exercise consistently, it's like the muscle pain gradually disappears.

The phenomenon of water retention also weakens gradually with consistent exercise, leading to a loss of body water.

Whether your weight does not decrease or even increases

It's the weight of water, not fat anyway.

Exercise helps improve physical abilities, which is beneficial for dieting.

It is advisable to exercise whenever possible.

In the case of consistently doing the second exercise.

If there are no issues with your diet and you are consistently exercising, but you are not losing weight,

There are often issues with exercise time.

You are exercising for too long.

As mentioned earlier,

When you exercise, tiny injuries occur in the muscles.

The reason this happens is that exercise itself puts a strain on the body.

Actions that put a strain on my body cause stress.

When you actually exercise, the secretion of the stress hormone cortisol increases.

Huh? So is exercise bad for the body?

No, that's not the case.

I talked about it in the stress series.

When a person's body is under stress, a phenomenon occurs where their abilities temporarily increase.

This is referred to as the fight-or-flight response to stress.

By putting stress on the body through exercise, it temporarily enhances performance.

The principle of exercise is to overcome strong resistance with increased ability in order to build muscle.

In this process, the muscles sustain minor injuries.

So, stress is not necessarily a bad thing.

The problem is chronic stress, which is exposure to stress for long periods of time.

One of the problems caused by chronic stress is an increase in body fat.

If you exercise for too long,

In fact, you may not lose weight or, conversely, you may gain weight.

And a day is 24 hours for everyone equally.

Having a long duration of exercise within the 24 hours of a day means that

This means that the break time is that short.

However, if the rest time is short, the effectiveness of the exercise decreases.

Because when you exercise, it causes injuries to the muscles, and

During rest, the wounds heal and the muscles grow.

If you exercise for a long time and take a short break,

Since the muscles are only getting injured and not recovering, the effects of exercise will diminish.

Lastly, one of the reasons many people exercise for a long time is that

Exercising for a long time burns a lot of calories, and

It's because I think that much body fat will be reduced.

Unfortunately, that's not the case.

traditional tribes that actually live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and

When comparing the daily metabolic rate of Westerners who sit all day,

There are studies that show there was no difference.

I explained the reason for this in the second part of the calorie video.

The video link is displayed in the upper right corner.

If you are curious about why there is no difference, you can click here to see.

To summarize,

Exercising for a longer duration does not necessarily lead to a greater reduction in body fat.

For the general public, it is recommended to exercise for about one hour a day.

But after just one hour of exercise, it doesn't feel like I've actually worked out, does it?

In that case, the intensity of the exercise is too low.

The ability to exercise for a long time in the first place means that the intensity of the exercise is low.

It is recommended to exercise for just one hour a day.

It's not just about maintaining a low intensity for only one hour.

It means to increase the intensity of your workout so that one hour is enough for a sufficient exercise.

Rather than doing it at a low intensity for a long time,

Doing it at a high intensity for a short duration is efficient.

In the next video, we will talk about how mental issues can affect weight loss.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the reasons why weight isn't lost.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
