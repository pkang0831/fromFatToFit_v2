If you diet without exercising, you will end up binge eating - Eating Disorders Part 9

This is the ninth video about eating disorders.

The causes of binge eating due to mental issues include low self-esteem, lack of physical activity, and loneliness.

In the last video, we talked about the decline in self-esteem.

In this video, I will talk about the lack of physical activity.

Binge eating due to mental issues, but what does it have to do with lack of physical activity?

Because the body affects the mind.

It is often said that the mind affects the body.

If you give a patient a drug that has no actual effect and claim that it is an effective medication,

In fact, the body can actually recover.

It is a phenomenon that occurs when the mind, believing that there will be an effect, influences the body.

This phenomenon is called the placebo effect.

However, it's not just the mind that affects the body; the body also influences the mind.

In fact, light exercise is sometimes recommended for patients with depression.

Moving the body affects the mind, which helps alleviate feelings of depression.

Conversely, if you don't move your body, you cannot alleviate feelings of depression.

This means that one becomes vulnerable to feelings of depression.

As mentioned in the video about the reasons why people with severe obesity don't want to exercise,

When weight increases, the imbalance between muscle and cardiovascular capacity can lead to a reluctance to move.

Because of this, I don't exercise and have low activity levels.

As mentioned in the eighth episode of the eating disorder series, many people who are obese often have low self-esteem.

I easily feel depressed due to low self-esteem.

If there is a certain level of activity, it can alleviate feelings of depression, so it may not be a problem.

If the level of activity is too low, it cannot alleviate feelings of depression.

There are many cases where people rely on food.

In this way, even if you don't need food or don't really want to eat, you end up eating.

It can lead to binge eating if it gets severe.

The way to solve this problem is to consciously increase your activity level.

The simplest way is to engage in light exercise.

People often think that if they exercise for the purpose of dieting, they have to do very intense workouts.

If someone who is not used to exercising forces themselves to do strenuous workouts,

The act of exercising itself is perceived as difficult and frustrating.

In this case, instead of alleviating the sadness, it only makes me more irritated.

Since it is a difficult exercise from the beginning, there are many cases where people give up in the middle.

If you give up halfway, your self-esteem decreases, and your feelings of depression become stronger.

And these feelings can easily lead to binge eating.

It is said that dieting is 70% diet and 30% exercise.

Rather than forcing yourself to do intense exercise for a few more days,

Preventing a single binge is more important, and

Because it is much more effective for dieting.

Rather than giving up in the middle of forcing yourself to do a tough workout,

It is good to focus on increasing your activity level by doing light exercises that I can do.

In summary, the act of moving the body itself is helpful for dieting.

There is no need to force yourself to challenge difficult exercises that are hard for you.

Move your body at a strength that you can handle and for as long as you can.

As you continue to exercise, you will become accustomed to it, and once you are familiar with it, you can increase the intensity of your workouts.

As a reference, when you get used to exercising and increase the intensity, you will feel a sense of accomplishment.

This sense of achievement is quite helpful in restoring self-esteem.

In that case, the problem mentioned in the previous video will also be resolved.

In the next video, I will talk about binge eating due to loneliness.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the 10-part series on eating disorders, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.
