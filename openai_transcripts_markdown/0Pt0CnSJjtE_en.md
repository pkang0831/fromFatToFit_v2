Drinking warm water helps you lose weight - Water Diet Part 3

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the third video about the water diet.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about cold water.

Drinking cold water lowers body temperature.

To raise this body temperature, energy is used.

There is a claim that using energy leads to weight loss.

Drinking cold water does not lead to weight loss, as it has been said.

There is a saying that drinking warm water helps with weight loss.

I have a question about whether this is correct.

In this video, I would like to talk about warm water.

To put it simply,

Drinking warm water can help with dieting.

There is a saying that obesity is the root of all diseases.

The reason there is such a story is that inflammatory substances are released from body fat.

When body fat increases, the amount of inflammatory substances also increases.

When the amount of inflammatory substances increases, it can develop into chronic inflammation.

This chronic inflammation is the cause of various diseases.

And this chronic inflammation causes insulin resistance, which negatively affects dieting.

In the video about distinguishing between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight, we talked about insulin.

When we eat food, nutrients are absorbed into the body.

Insulin hormone is secreted to process this nutrient.

Processed foods allow a large amount of nutrients to enter the body in a short period of time.

To process a large amount of nutrients, a significant amount of insulin is also required.

It was said that a lot of insulin induces overeating and makes us gain weight.

Insulin resistance refers to the body's resistance to the effects of insulin.

For example, one of the main functions of insulin is to lower blood sugar levels.

When insulin resistance occurs,

Even if insulin is secreted, blood sugar does not decrease.

It is about being resistant to insulin.

If high blood sugar levels are maintained, inflammation occurs in the blood vessel walls.

From the body's perspective, it needs to block this.

To lower blood sugar by overcoming resistance, more insulin is secreted.

And a lot of insulin makes us obese.

This is why there is a saying that to lose weight, one must improve insulin resistance.

So, when body fat increases and obesity occurs, chronic inflammation develops.

Chronic inflammation increases insulin resistance.

When insulin resistance increases, more insulin is secreted.

When insulin is secreted in large amounts, body fat increases more.

Due to the increased body fat, a vicious cycle occurs where chronic inflammation worsens.

However, warm water has a beneficial effect on improving this chronic inflammation.

To be precise, it is when the body temperature rises that chronic inflammation improves.

Drinking warm water raises your body temperature.

Warm water can also be said to help improve chronic inflammation.

When chronic inflammation improves, insulin resistance also improves.

When insulin resistance improves, the amount of insulin secreted decreases, which helps with dieting.

Oh? So, does living in a hot environment help with dieting?

No, that's not the case.

I talked about body temperature and dieting in Part 1.

There is a difference between the heat generated inside the body and the heat generated outside the body.

The reason warm water is effective is that it enters the body.

Living just to stay warm isn't very helpful.

What temperature does warm water refer to?

It refers to something that is moderately hot, to the extent that it is not uncomfortable to drink.

For reference, the cold water mentioned in Part 1 of the video does not refer to ice water.

You can think of it as water that is moderately cool, enough to drink comfortably.

In the first part of the video, you mentioned that drinking cold water in the morning is good for dieting, right?

However, in this video, you mentioned that warm water is good?

The reason mentioned in Part 1 of the video that drinking cold water in the morning can be helpful is

It is effective in awakening dormant organs.

There is a saying that drinking warm water before bed helps with a good night's sleep.

Warm water makes the organs comfortable and helps them relax.

For waking up in the morning, cold water is more effective than warm water.

Then, when I wake up in the morning, I drink cold water.

Can I drink warm water after that?

I mentioned it in part one as well.

If you like cold water and there are no problems with drinking it, then you can drink it.

does not like cold water or

If you experience any issues with your body after drinking, it is better not to drink.

For example, when I drank cold water, I felt a very cold sensation in my stomach.

There may be cases of cold hands and feet, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.

This is due to the low heat generated within the body, making it difficult to maintain body temperature.

In this situation, drinking cold water to lower your body temperature further is not a good idea.

On the contrary, in the case of people who generate a lot of heat inside their bodies,

I find it very difficult to drink warm water.

Humans are warm-blooded animals, which means that their body temperature must be maintained at a constant level.

It is not good for the body temperature to drop, but it is also not good for it to rise.

If you force yourself to keep drinking warm water when your body is already generating enough heat,

The body prevents its temperature from rising too high.

It reduces the heat generated inside the body.

In this case, it can actually be harmful to your health.

If you think about a support belt, it becomes easy to understand.

People with weak core muscles often experience back pain.

Wearing a brace at this time reduces the pain.

It's because the abdominal belt replaces the core muscles.

However, wearing a support belt has made it more comfortable. If you keep wearing the support belt without exercising...

The core muscles will become weaker.

The core muscles are not doing their job because the abdominal belt is doing it instead.

It is better to have strong core muscles than to keep wearing a support belt.

A support belt should be considered merely as an auxiliary means to reduce pain.

Exercising is the best.

Similarly, my body can maintain its temperature well on its own.

So it's difficult to drink warm water.

If you ignore this and force yourself to keep drinking warm water,

In order to maintain body temperature, the heat generated inside the body is reduced.

In this case, it actually means that the body becomes weaker.

Warm water is definitely better, not cold water.

Since everyone is different, it means to drink according to your own condition.

I know which water I should drink, but...

How should I drink that water?

I've heard that you should drink 2 liters a day. Do you really have to drink exactly 2 liters?

In the next video, I will talk about this.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 4 of the water diet,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
