The topic of this video is about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

First of all, the fundamental concept of this diet is

I'm talking about a diet where the calories obtained from carbohydrates are lower than the calories obtained from fats.

A diet that meets these conditions corresponds to a low-carb, high-fat diet.

For example, a diet where you eat 10g of carbohydrates and 1000g of fat.

A diet that includes 100g of carbohydrates and 50g of fat or

Both are classified as low-carb, high-fat diets.

I understand the 10g and 1000g, but what about the 100g and 50g?

Many people think that it is not a low-carb, high-fat diet.

If there are 100g of carbohydrates and 50g of fat, there are more carbohydrates, right?

Then I eat more carbohydrates.

Many people ask how this is a low-carb, high-fat diet.

To clarify the concept of a diet once again,

It refers to a state where the calories obtained from carbohydrates are lower than the calories obtained from fats.

Carbohydrates provide 4 kcal of energy per gram.

Fat provides 9 kcal of energy per gram.

This means that 100g of carbohydrates provides 400 kcal of energy.

50g of fat provides 450 kcal of energy.

Fat at 450 kcal is greater than carbohydrates at 400 kcal.

So, the calories obtained from fat are greater than those obtained from carbohydrates.

So that's how it becomes a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Of course, while watching the video, you might think, "No, 100g of carbohydrates is too much."

You should consume less than 50g per day. Some people might think you should eat less than 30g.

No, you're not eating enough fat.

Some people may think that 70-80% of the calories consumed in a day should come from fat.

However, the low-carb, high-fat diet is...

As long as the initial conditions I mentioned are met, it all falls under a low-carb, high-fat diet.

So what does it mean when we say 50g or 70%?

Within a low-carb, high-fat diet, there are meal plans that have specific conditions added for particular purposes.

There are many such diets, and I just brought one condition from one of those diets.

For example, there is the Atkins diet.

This diet restricts carbohydrate intake on a weekly basis: Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4.

In the first week, the intake of carbohydrates is limited to less than 10g per day. That means you are hardly eating any.

Then, if this happens, all the carbohydrates in the body will be depleted.

Because there is a lack of carbohydrates, a rebound starts to occur.

I am experiencing some side effects, like headaches and feeling weak.

In this state, you gradually increase the amount of carbohydrates you eat each week, little by little.

Then, naturally, the rebound from the lack of carbohydrates will gradually decrease accordingly.

Continuing to increase in this way...

The goal of this diet is to find the point at which my body does not feel the side effects of carbohydrate deficiency.

That amount is the appropriate quantity of carbohydrates for my body, so if I eat according to that amount...

There are no side effects from eating too few carbohydrates.

It is possible to reduce body fat without the obesity that comes from eating a lot of carbohydrates.

Because everyone's lifestyle patterns and bodies are different,

The minimum intake of carbohydrates that does not cause any issues in the body varies.

The goal is to find that minimum intake amount.

Another diet is the ketogenic diet, and in the case of the ketogenic diet...

It's a diet that induces abnormalities in the body by consuming insufficient carbohydrates.

Among the organs in the body, in the case of the brain,

We can't use anything other than glucose as fuel.

However, the raw material for glucose is carbohydrates.

So, if we limit our carbohydrate intake,

There is a shortage of glucose available for use in the brain.

You can't just die from not eating carbohydrates.

I started looking for an energy source that can replace glucose.

It starts to extract it from proteins and fats.

Once you start extracting that energy from the local area,

Of course, ketone bodies are produced.

The state in which ketone bodies are produced in the body is called ketosis.

The ketogenic diet is designed to intentionally induce this state.

So it is also called a ketogenic diet.

It is also referred to as a ketogenic diet or a ketosis diet.

So why do people intentionally put their bodies into a state of ketosis?

The body uses fat in areas where it is needed.

Even in places where carbohydrates are needed, it is to make it possible to extract and use energy from fats.

Doing that will help reduce body fat quickly.

So there will be some side effects as a reaction in the body, but...

As long as that period doesn't extend too long, it won't lead to fatal damage.

So, taking that into account, it's a diet aimed at reducing body fat as quickly as possible.

However, this has been misunderstood.

Our bodies primarily metabolize carbohydrates.

When you enter a state of ketosis, your metabolism primarily relies on fat.

Therefore, if you do not enter a state of ketosis, body fat will not be lost.

Some people think that it is essential to achieve a state of ketosis at all costs.

But that's not the case.

When you think about why weight is gained, it's a problem that can be understood simply.

When we consume a lot of carbohydrates,

The carbohydrates that enter the body are converted into glucose.

It spreads throughout the body through the blood.

When the amount of glucose in the blood increases, blood sugar levels rise.

When blood sugar levels rise, inflammation occurs in the blood vessels.

When inflammation occurs, it can be dangerous, so a hormone called insulin is secreted by the body.

Glucose in the blood is converted into fat for storage.

This is the process of us gaining weight.

In that way, accumulated body fat leads to obesity.

If we have a carbohydrate-based diet, then...

Carbohydrates do not remain in the body as they are; instead, they are used in a different form.

Even if you eat a lot of carbohydrates, they are converted into fat and stored for later use.

Even if you eat a lot of fat, it is used in the form of fat.

Does the body consume more carbohydrates or more fats?

In the end, it focuses on a metabolism centered around fat.

Simply put, ketosis is a state where even in places like the brain that require carbohydrates...

It refers to a state that encourages the use of fat.

It is an overinterpretation to say that body fat can only be burned when in a state of ketosis.

Now, the next thing is Pelio.

In the case of the Paleo diet, it is sometimes referred to as "Paléo" due to the English pronunciation.

In this case, there is no restriction on the amount of carbohydrates you should consume in a day.

It only limits the types of food.

What I mean is

Grains are food for birds, so they are not suitable for humans.

Milk, in the case of calves, is food meant for them and is not suitable for humans.

Processed meats are made for people to eat, but...

Various additives are included, and these can cause health issues.

Therefore, do not eat unhealthy products such as grains, milk, and processed foods.

The Pelio diet is about eating fresh meat and vegetables.

There are no restrictions on how many grams of carbohydrates you should eat in a day.

As long as it's fresh meat and vegetables, it's a very simple diet where you can eat until you're full.

And in the case of the two diets mentioned earlier, they burn body fat.

If the goal was to lose weight,

In the case of Pelio, fat loss is not the primary goal.

In the case of processed meats, the additives contained within are harmful to health.

In the case of grains, the carbohydrate content is very high and it causes a rapid increase in blood sugar levels.

There is a risk of increasing body fat.

Milk was originally known as a healthy food.

Many modern people have lactose intolerance, which means they cannot properly digest milk.

And in the first place, milk is not meant for humans to consume; it is meant for calves.

Based on these reasons, exclude foods that may be harmful to health.

Eating fresh meat and vegetables that are good for health makes the body healthy.

And the concept is that in the process of becoming healthy, the disease of obesity is treated.

The diet you are following is not actually for the purpose of dieting.

So in the case of Paleo, it's a diet that changes the very way you live your life.

If you look for a similar concept, there are vegetarians.

If a person who used to eat meat says, "I will become a vegetarian now,"

You're saying that you won't eat meat for the rest of your life, right?

This means that I will change the way I live my life like this.

Pellio is also the same; he will not eat such unhealthy food in the future.

I will only eat fresh meat and vegetables that are good for my health.

It's about changing the way you live your life.

So it's a diet that you follow for a lifetime.

Well then, regarding what was mentioned earlier, in the case of Atkins, ketogenic, and paleo diets...

It's all about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Since the energy obtained from fat intake is greater than that from carbohydrate intake,

However, these three diets are not the same.

The ketogenic diet is a diet that induces a state of ketosis.

Atkins aims to determine the minimum carbohydrate intake that does not induce a state of ketosis.

In the case of Paleo, there is no restriction on carbohydrate intake from the beginning.

How can these three be the same diet?

However, in addition to this, while meeting the basic condition of low carbohydrates and high fats,

There is also a diet that includes additional conditions based on one's own logic and reasoning.

That diet is a completely different diet.

So you need to be able to distinguish that difference first.

I can understand the low-carb, high-fat diet.

Usually, the truly unfortunate misunderstandings that spread on the internet are...

After learning a little bit of consistent information about these diets,

Combining that, let's create a hypothetical diet plan.

Some people think that it's a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Now, those who think the worst of me...

Creating a state of ketosis with a ketogenic diet and

Combining these two aspects of Pelio's lifelong diet.

Some people think that a low-carb, high-fat diet is a diet that maintains a state of ketosis for a lifetime.

However, the state of ketosis is an emergency that occurs when the body is lacking carbohydrates.

If this is sustained for a long time, it is obviously not good for your health.

People who are on a ketogenic diet know that too.

I want to quickly reduce body fat in a short period of time.

After that, I maintained a healthy diet and exercised.

Maintaining the weight lost through dieting is what the ketogenic diet is about.

No one has said they would do that for a lifetime like Pelé.

However, when you mix those two things together, a strange diet is created.

It's only natural to be concerned about various diseases that can arise from eating a low-carbohydrate diet for an extended period.

It’s better to think that a low-carb, high-fat diet is bad and say you shouldn’t do it. People who think like this are actually better.

Because I couldn't think that this is a bad thing.

I heard that a low-carb, high-fat diet can help with weight loss.

What is a low-carb, high-fat diet?

Ah, you misunderstood and thought that it's a diet to maintain ketosis for a lifetime.

There are people who take on this challenge for a very long time.

Then, of course, it becomes very difficult and there are issues with the body.

So, please actually go to the hospital and receive treatment.

They are saying that their health has worsened due to following a low-carb, high-fat diet.

With that, you can persuade others, or it doesn't matter.

You end up neglecting your own body, and that's not good.

So if you're interested in trying a low-carb, high-fat diet, let me know.

I hope you understand that these diets are all different.

Among those diets, in your current situation.

What kind of diet is the most efficient and effective?

You need to think about whether I can do well.

In this video, I was planning to share my diet as well.

I feel like the content of the video is getting too long, so I'll stop here for this video.

In the next video, I will show you how I am following my diet.

And there are issues that arise while following a low-carb, high-fat diet. Many people ask about them.

I will organize a few things and answer them in a Q&A format.
