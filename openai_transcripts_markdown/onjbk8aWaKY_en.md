Menstrual Cycle and One Week After Menstruation - Menstrual Diet Part 3

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video about menstruation and dieting.

In the first part of the video, we explored the reason behind the saying "You can gain weight just by drinking water."

In the second part of the video, we talked about the ovulation period and the week before menstruation during the menstrual cycle.

In this video, I will talk about the menstrual cycle and the week after menstruation.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it is recommended to watch the videos in order starting from the earlier one.

For those who haven't seen the previous video, the playlist link is now appearing in the top right corner.

You can click and watch the videos in order starting from the one at the front.

During the ovulation period and the week before menstruation, appetite increases and weight tends to rise due to preparations for pregnancy.

When menstruation begins, there is no need to prepare for pregnancy, which leads to a decrease in appetite and weight loss.

I've heard that some people experience an increase in appetite when their period starts.

If your period has started and your appetite has increased, there are two main reasons for this.

The first is the lack of moisture that was discussed in the second part of the video.

When menstruation begins, a significant amount of blood is lost through menstrual blood, leading to a deficiency of fluids in the body.

When the body is lacking hydration, it can lead to symptoms of hunger.

In this case, drinking water to replenish hydration will reduce your appetite.

If you still have an appetite even after drinking water, stress could be the cause.

When the body is exposed to stressful situations, the stress hormone cortisol is released.

Cortisol has the effect of increasing appetite.

When you experience a lot of stress from your period, you may notice an increase in appetite.

I've heard that menstruation is really annoying. Is it possible to not feel stressed?

You can't avoid stress, but you can reduce the secretion of cortisol.

The secretion of hormones affects the body and can lead to changes in behavior, but

On the contrary, actions can affect the body and influence hormone secretion.

In fact, it is sometimes prescribed for people with symptoms of depression to engage in light exercise.

Light exercise affects the body and induces the secretion of happiness hormones.

The secretion of happiness hormones alleviates the symptoms of depression.

Cortisol is a hormone that is secreted in response to stress situations to help cope with them.

When cortisol is released, the body enters an alert state, causing the heart rate to increase and breathing to become shallow and rapid.

This is a case where cortisol has caused changes in the body's condition and behavior.

On the contrary, when you intentionally take deep and long breaths, your heart rate slows down and your state of arousal decreases.

When the state of arousal subsides, the secretion of cortisol decreases.

They say that the caffeine in coffee has a stimulating effect. So, should I not drink coffee?

Yes, that's right.

The caffeine in coffee has a stimulating effect, which increases the secretion of cortisol when you drink coffee.

It may not be a problem under normal circumstances.

If you are in a situation where you are experiencing a lot of stress and need to lower cortisol secretion,

It is advisable to reduce coffee consumption.

Green tea contains caffeine, so should I avoid drinking green tea as well?

Green tea is a bit different.

The caffeine content in green tea is much lower than that in coffee, and green tea contains components that help to calm the mind and body.

Drinking green tea has the effect of reducing cortisol secretion.

So, if you drink one or two cups, it can help reduce cortisol.

On the contrary, it is advisable to avoid energy drinks, which contain significantly higher levels of caffeine than coffee.

In addition to this, engaging in light exercise or listening to music that relaxes the mind can also be helpful.

Watching funny videos and getting a good night's sleep are both helpful.

One week after the last period.

Since my period has ended, my stress has decreased, leading to a reduction in cortisol secretion.

Since there is no blood loss due to menstrual blood, symptoms of dehydration will also disappear.

Because there is no cortisol and dehydration, the increased appetite returns to normal.

As the water and nutrients stored for pregnancy are depleted, even while just sitting still, weight will start to decrease.

You can think of the weight that increased due to your menstrual cycle as returning to its original state.

Even if you stay still, your weight decreases, and your appetite doesn't increase.

It is often referred to as the golden period for dieting, which is the best time to start a diet.

There are cases where people misunderstand this and think that dieting is meaningless during periods other than the golden period.

However, that is not the case.

It is possible to diet during ovulation, the week before menstruation, and during menstruation.

However, due to the increased weight in preparation for pregnancy, it is difficult to determine how much weight has been lost through changes in weight.

It is difficult to determine how much weight you have lost due to changes in body water, as the body swells with increased water retention.

It's hard to notice the changes. It's not that there are no effects from the diet.

If you have been following the methods shown in the video correctly, your body fat should be decreasing.

You can expect to see how much body fat has decreased about a week after your period.

So, if a woman wants to check how much weight she has lost,

The most accurate way is to compare the week after last month's period with the week after this month's period.

There is no need to stress if you haven't lost weight by measuring your weight every day.

Sounds plausible, right?
