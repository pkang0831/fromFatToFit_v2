Hello, this is pkang.

This is a video responding to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the comment content.

I watched two videos about insulin, but the content is different. Which video's information is correct?

To summarize briefly, I have a question about insulin.

I watched two videos on YouTube, but I'm confused because the content of the videos is contradictory.

You are asking which video's statement is correct.

In the first video I watched,

It was said that unrefined carbohydrates secrete less insulin than proteins and fats.

In the second video,

Fat does not raise blood sugar levels, so it does not stimulate insulin secretion.

Even if insulin is released, it seems that fat does not turn into body fat.

Since there is no such content in the videos I uploaded,

It seems that you asked me a question after watching a video posted by someone else.

So, which statement is correct among the contents of the two videos?

Why is it that eating carbohydrates and fats together can lead to obesity?

If eating together causes problems, should we eat separately?

You are asking about how much of a gap should be maintained if they need to be taken separately.

I will talk about each one individually.

Content of the first video.

In the case of unrefined carbohydrates, they release less insulin compared to proteins and fats.

To explain this, a detailed explanation of insulin is necessary.

Simply put, insulin is a gatekeeper hormone that allows nutrients to enter the cells.

We also store the carbohydrates we eat too much of in fat cells.

It also involves putting the fat you consume into fat cells.

I also work on putting protein into muscle cells to build muscle.

For those who exercise to build muscle or work as trainers,

It is said that eating a lot of carbohydrates is good.

The reason is not only to increase the muscle glycogen storage but also to raise the intensity of the exercise.

The increase in insulin due to carbohydrates helps with muscle synthesis.

However, insulin is not secreted in a constant amount.

If there are many incoming nutrients, a lot will be secreted.

If the incoming nutrients are low, secretion will also be low.

In the case of unrefined carbohydrates like fruits and vegetables, the carbohydrate content per gram is very low.

However, even unrefined foods, meat or oil that contain protein and fat have a high content per gram.

So, compared to unrefined carbohydrates, protein and fat foods lead to a greater secretion of insulin.

In simple terms, insulin responds to carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

When comparing a situation where carbohydrates are coming in slightly to a situation where fats and proteins are coming in abundantly,

In a situation where there is a high intake of fats and proteins, the secretion of insulin is increased.

Then why have we only talked about refined carbohydrates and insulin until now?

There is a difference in the amount of insulin secreted for unrefined carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

This is because there is no additional secretion of insulin due to the increase in blood sugar.

Blood sugar refers to the concentration of glucose in the blood.

Glucose is produced from carbohydrates.

If the amount of carbohydrates I consume is low, then less glucose is produced and blood sugar does not rise significantly.

However, in the case of refined carbohydrates, they are quickly digested and absorbed.

It has the characteristic of having a very high carbohydrate content.

So, when you consume refined carbohydrates, your blood sugar levels rise significantly.

To lower the elevated blood sugar levels, additional insulin is secreted.

For the sake of convenience in explanation, I will refer to this insulin as "additional insulin."

This additional insulin causes problems.

If the content in the first video is about insulin as a whole, then it is not incorrect.

However, this information is correct; obesity does not occur solely from protein and fat.

Because the issue of obesity arises from excess insulin.

This is because additional insulin is not secreted with just protein and fat.

Second video

Fat does not raise blood sugar levels, so it does not stimulate insulin.

Even if insulin is released, fat does not become body fat.

In the case of the first video, it discussed insulin itself regardless of obesity.

So if we talked about regular insulin that does not affect obesity,

In this video, we will discuss additional insulin in relation to obesity.

What this means is

As mentioned earlier, insulin is released regardless of what food we eat.

If we talk in terms of regions,

When you consume fat, insulin is released, and insulin stores fat in fat cells, leading to an increase in body fat.

However, the increased body fat does not necessarily lead to obesity.

The reason this is the case is that

Our bodies continuously consume energy 24 hours a day, but we can't eat food continuously for 24 hours.

So whenever you eat, a portion of the food is always stored as body fat.

So, during the remaining time when I am not eating, I use energy from body fat.

Our bodies, whether we are dieting or not, regardless of being normal or obese,

The body is designed to always store a certain amount of body fat and to burn a certain amount of body fat.

This is the body's basic metabolism.

When talking about obesity, there's really no need to discuss these general statements.

So let's leave this out.

I will focus only on the accumulation of body fat that leads to additional insulin and obesity.

To rephrase the content shown in the video,

Fat does not raise blood sugar levels, so it does not stimulate the secretion of additional insulin.

This means that without additional insulin, there is no accumulation of body fat to the extent of becoming obese.

So the two videos mentioned in the question are not that one is right and the other is wrong, but rather...

The standard of insulin I want to talk about is whether it is the insulin secreted after eating food.

The difference arises here, whether it is additional insulin secreted due to blood sugar issues.

Finally, is it okay to eat carbohydrates and fats together? I will answer this question.

When unrefined carbohydrates are consumed with fruits or vegetables, insulin is naturally released because food has been eaten.

However, since blood sugar does not rise significantly, there is no additional secretion of insulin.

Since there is no additional insulin secretion, unnecessary accumulation of body fat does not occur.

There is no issue of becoming obese because there is no false hunger.

When consuming refined carbohydrates and fats together,

Insulin is secreted because food has been consumed.

Refined carbohydrates cause a rapid spike in blood sugar levels.

Because the blood sugar has risen sharply, additional insulin is secreted to lower the blood sugar.

When additional insulin is secreted, glucose in the blood is stored as body fat.

If there was no additional insulin, fat that would not have become body fat will become body fat.

Blood sugar levels rise sharply and then drop, leading to issues with blood sugar fluctuations.

The fat that should be used for energy has become body fat, which leads to issues with energy conversion.

Due to these two reasons, I ate enough food, but...

You may feel the desire to snack or experience a false hunger when you get hungry.

If you can't resist fake hunger and eat food, you will ultimately become obese.

To summarize, the issue does not arise from eating carbohydrates and fats together.

The problem arises from refined carbohydrates.

If you consume unrefined carbohydrates and fats together, there will be no issues.

Sounds plausible, right?
