In Part 1 of the video, the basic principles of an interesting story are discussed.

In the second part of the video, we explored why jokes from workplace bosses are often not funny.

In this video, we will explore how to have a conversation with someone you are meeting for the first time.

Since this content continues from parts 1 and 2, it will be easier to understand if you watch the previous videos first.

The playlist link is displayed at the top right.

If you haven't watched the previous video, it's a good idea to click and watch it first.

If you have watched parts 1 and 2, you would know that

To find a story interesting, one must be able to understand it.

To understand the story, some background knowledge is necessary.

People who share commonalities have similar background knowledge.

It was suggested that it would be good to choose a topic that allows you to be in the same position by utilizing that.

This principle forms the foundation of all conversations.

In the case of meeting someone for the first time, there is no information about the other person at all.

It's difficult to choose a topic where everyone is on the same page, but the solution to this is very simple.

You can ask the other person questions and gather information.

Ask various questions to gather information about favorite foods, hobbies, preferences, etc.

You can talk according to that information.

People who often don't know what to talk about when meeting someone for the first time

There are many cases where people don't know the facts themselves, so they need to ask questions. If they don't ask questions, they have nothing to say.

And there are times when I ask questions, but the conversation doesn't flow well.

This is a case where the information obtained from the question cannot be utilized.

For example, there could be a situation like this.

What are your hobbies?

I enjoy watching movies.

What kind of weather do you like?

I like weather when it doesn't rain because it's humid when it rains.

What is your favorite color?

I like green.

I am obtaining information through questions, but I am unable to utilize that information and keep asking questions instead.

In such cases, if there are no more questions, the conversation tends to come to a halt.

The person asking the question is constantly trying to come up with the next question in their mind.

As a result, I sometimes can't focus properly on the conversation and end up repeating questions I've already asked.

In this case, from the other person's perspective, the very purpose of the conversation becomes unclear.

You keep asking questions.

And when I keep repeating the same question, I sometimes feel like I'm not focusing on my own words.

So, it's not the act of asking questions that is important, but rather...

It is important to utilize the information obtained through questions.

You shouldn't focus solely on just asking questions.

When I asked a question, the other person seemed uncomfortable instead.

When you keep asking questions without revealing your own information, this phenomenon occurs.

The reason we ask questions is to find commonalities and shared understanding with others.

It's better to choose a topic where both sides are in the same position to have a conversation.

However, if I keep asking questions and the other person keeps answering, then the process continues to repeat.

I have a lot of information about the other person, but the other person is in a situation where they don't have any information.

In this way, there will be a difference in perspective between those who have a lot of information and those who do not.

When there is a difference in positions like this, it can create a very uncomfortable feeling.

If someone comes and asks me probing questions without revealing who they are,

I feel very uncomfortable, and the reason is because of this.

So if you ask the other person questions and receive information, it is good to share your own information accordingly.

And depending on the situation, it's also good to share my information first and then ask questions afterward.

Among conversation skills, when talking to someone for the first time,

It is better to first reveal who I am and then ask questions about the other person.

If you want to have a deep conversation with the other person,

First, there is a saying that I need to open the door to my heart and bring out the deep stories within me.

This is all a skill to balance information.

What should I do if there are no common points after asking a question?

One side likes to relax at home, while the other side loves to travel, so they are completely different.

One side has various experiences related to travel, and

On the other hand, if the situation is one where there is no experience with travel at all.

When thinking simply, it seems that we cannot be in the same position when it comes to stories about travel.

That's not the case.

For example, you can talk about the very first trip as a topic.

Then we would be in the same position.

Even for someone who loves to travel and goes often, there is always a first trip.

On the very first trip, you often make many mistakes because you lack experience and knowledge.

It means being in the same position as someone who never travels.

When the other person talked about the mistakes they made on their first trip.

"Oh really?? If I were in that situation, I would have done the same thing! Haha."

It's also fun to react like this.

I understand that it's okay to just share my thoughts, even if I'm not well-versed in travel.

Before going on my first trip, I also had those thoughts.

However, if you choose the theme of the story based on a recent trip rather than the first trip,

People can be divided into those who have traveled a lot and those who know nothing about travel.

In this case, when the other person shares their skilled travel stories, all I can do is nod my head.

It becomes very difficult to react.

And in terms of the flow of the story, it's difficult to express my thoughts about travel since I don't know much about it.

If you talk about something, it can sometimes make you look ignorant if you're not careful.

To summarize,

A person with a sense of humor is one type of person who conveys stories well.

If the story you convey is interesting, you become a person with a sense of humor.

And the way to tell a good story is to take an interest in the person you are talking to.

Take an interest in the person you are talking to and understand what background knowledge they have.

You need to think about how to explain things so that the person can understand well, and communicate accordingly to convey your message effectively.

Without any interest in the person I am talking to.

Simply pouring out what I want to say from my perspective cannot be called a conversation.

Let's engage with the person we're talking to and communicate in a way that they can understand well.

Just knowing this one thing is enough for you to have a good conversation.
