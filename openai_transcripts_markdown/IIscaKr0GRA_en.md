On cheat days, drinking this will help you gain less weight - Vinegar Part 2

This is the second video about vinegar.

In the last video, I briefly talked about the principles of vinegar for dieting.

In this video, I would like to talk about situations where vinegar is effective.

In Part 1 of the video, the acetic acid in vinegar slows down digestion.

When digestion slows down, the rate at which blood sugar rises after eating slows down as well.

It was said that if the rate at which blood sugar rises slows down, the amount of insulin secreted decreases.

When the secretion of insulin decreases, appetite decreases, leading to satisfaction with less food.

It was said that the rate at which the same food is converted into body fat decreases.

It is said that drinking vinegar leads to weight loss based on this principle.

This does not mean that vinegar itself reduces body fat, but rather that it slows down digestion.

It is because digestion slows down that weight loss occurs.

Just because someone drinks a lot of vinegar, it doesn't mean their digestion can slow down indefinitely, right?

So try not to drink too much vinegar.

I had advised to drink no more than 30ml a day to avoid health issues.

It is important to note that digestion does not slow down indefinitely here.

In the past, I explained the basic principles of all diets.

I made a video titled "How to Distinguish Between Foods That Make You Gain Weight and Foods That Help You Lose Weight."

Processing food that couldn't be eaten in large quantities in the video so that it can be eaten in larger amounts.

It was mentioned that the problem lies in processing foods that are slow to digest and absorb so that they digest and absorb quickly.

Food like that is called refined food, while unprocessed food is referred to as unrefined food.

Unrefined foods are basically foods that are digested and absorbed slowly.

So when you eat it, it has a dieting effect.

So when you eat refined foods that are quickly digested and absorbed,

When you consume vinegar, it slows down digestion, and the effects begin to appear.

If you are eating unrefined foods that are originally slow to digest and absorb,

Even if you consume additional vinegar, the effect may not be significant.

The food itself is already difficult to digest.

There is actually an example of an experiment that was conducted.

11 experimental participants were asked to eat bagels and juice, as well as chicken and rice.

When comparing the cases of having consumed vinegar and not having consumed it,

The group that ate bagels and juice experienced an increase in fullness when they drank vinegar, leading to a decrease in the amount of food they consumed.

Bagels are food made from ground wheat flour, and juice is a liquid food.

Both contain carbohydrates.

On the other hand, rice contains carbohydrates, but since it is not in powder form, it is digested and absorbed more slowly than wheat.

Chicken is naturally a food that digests more slowly than liquid juice and contains fewer carbohydrates.

So when comparing foods that raise blood sugar quickly to those that raise it more slowly,

Eating foods that quickly raise blood sugar along with vinegar shows effective results.

It means that consuming food that is not like that will have less effect.

In simple terms, if you are following a good diet plan, adding vinegar may not have a significant effect.

So, does that mean the diet effect of vinegar is meaningless?

Even if vinegar is said to be effective, it probably isn't as good as eating a proper diet.

If you are on a diet, vinegar is not effective.

That's not the case. Its usability is higher than you might think.

It would be great if we could continue our diet with unprocessed foods, but...

There are situations where you have no choice but to eat processed food.

In such cases, eating it with vinegar can help you gain less weight or assist in dieting.

For example, students who have to eat school meals or

There are office workers who have to have lunch with their colleagues.

When eating school meals or lunch, consuming vinegar can be helpful.

Many people want to become slim by consistently following a diet, but

One of the reasons why not many people stick to a diet for a long time is because of the taste of the food.

Salt increases water retention, causing the body to swell, and sugar raises blood sugar levels.

In a typical diet plan, efforts are made to reduce the intake of sugar and salt.

This often results in a lack of flavor.

You need to break away from刺激的 flavors. Only then can you diet.

There are stories like this, but there are also people for whom it just doesn't work at all.

So in the video about the taste of the diet...

I mentioned the reasons why you don't need to severely restrict sugar and salt.

Still, out of the concern that I might gain weight, I often force myself to eat unappetizing meals.

When eating processed foods, consuming vinegar can help with dieting.

The amount of seasoning added to unprocessed food can be sufficiently blocked by vinegar.

Of course, that doesn't mean it's okay to add as much sugar as you want.

At least you can add more seasoning than what you're currently eating.

Then it will be a bit easier to eat.

Additionally, if you consume vinegar on a cheat day when eating a lot of processed foods, it may help you gain less weight.

It's more useful than you might think, right?

There are many types of vinegar, right, Mr. pkang?

Pineapple vinegar was really popular a while ago.

If you go to the supermarket, you'll find a wide variety of drinking vinegars.

Is it okay to drink that kind of vinegar?

In the next video, we will talk about the different types of vinegar.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the vinegar part 3 video, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
