Weight Loss Meal Method While Sleeping - Sleep Diet Part 3

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitle feature.

This is the third video about sleep and dieting.

In the first video, I talked about why a lack of sleep increases appetite.

In the second video, we talked about why a lack of sleep can lead to weight gain even without eating.

If you have watched the previous video, you would have understood how important sleep is for dieting.

There are times when you want to sleep but can't.

There are various factors that can disrupt sleep.

One of the things that many people overlook is their eating habits.

In this video, I will talk about this eating habit.

The first dietary habit for a good night's sleep is not eating before bedtime.

It is common knowledge that it is better not to eat before going to bed, but

Due to the drowsiness that occurs after eating.

It's more comfortable to sleep after eating than to sleep on an empty stomach.

There are quite a few cases where people eat food and then go to sleep.

However, eating food before going to bed greatly disrupts deep sleep.

When we eat food, the digestive system needs to digest it.

During this process, blood is concentrated in the digestive organs.

When blood is concentrated in the digestive organs, the amount of blood in the head decreases relatively.

When the blood flow to the head decreases, the oxygen and energy supplied to the brain also decrease.

This makes me feel drowsy.

This is what we call post-lunch drowsiness.

So the reason for post-meal drowsiness is that the digestive system is actively working.

It is naturally difficult to have a deep sleep when the digestive system is actively working.

I do sleep due to drowsiness, but the quality of my sleep is low.

You should finish eating at least 4 hours before going to sleep, as sleeping on an empty stomach can help you get a good night's rest.

However, even if I eat food 4 hours ago, I still feel hungry when it's time to sleep...

You need to change the types of food you eat.

I talked about it in detail in the intermittent fasting series.

Processed refined foods can quickly raise blood sugar levels significantly.

When blood sugar rises quickly and significantly, a large amount of insulin is secreted.

Insulin secreted in large amounts creates false hunger.

So when I eat processed food, I start wanting to eat again every 3 to 4 hours.

Because of this, it's difficult to finish my meal four hours before sleeping.

Four hours after eating, I want to eat again.

However, when eating unrefined foods,

The feeling of fullness lasts for about 7 to 8 hours.

You can sleep well without feeling hungry even if you eat 4 hours before going to bed.

This part is explained in detail in the intermittent fasting series.

You can check the intermittent fasting playlist.

The second dietary habit for a good night's sleep is not overeating during the day.

As mentioned earlier, when you eat, blood is concentrated in the digestive organs.

When blood is concentrated in the digestive system, it causes drowsiness, which is referred to as postprandial somnolence.

When you overeat and consume a lot of food, the digestive system has to work harder.

The more work you do, the more blood will flow.

So, if you overeat, it means that your drowsiness after eating will become more severe.

If you overeat during the day and end up sleeping due to drowsiness,

I took a nap, so I can't sleep at night.

If you can't sleep at night, it will be hard to get a good night's rest.

So it's important not to overeat.

The third dietary habit for a good night's sleep is a balanced diet.

When dieting, there are often cases where people follow a diet that severely restricts certain nutrients.

To follow a low-calorie diet, one may also limit fat intake.

To avoid raising blood sugar levels, carbohydrates are sometimes restricted.

In the case of a diet that restricts specific nutrients like this,

There are many cases where I can't sleep at all, or even if I do sleep, I often wake up frequently.

It's because the diet is not balanced.

In the case of a ketogenic diet that severely restricts carbohydrate intake,

It causes insomnia as a side effect.

Therefore, it is advisable to have a balanced diet.

Does a balanced diet refer to a diet consisting of 60% carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 20% fat?

No.

A diet consisting of 60% carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 20% fat is referred to as a balanced diet.

To maintain that ratio in your meals, you must include grains such as rice and wheat.

In the absence of grains, it's not possible to meet 60% of the carbohydrate requirement.

So, while we say it's a balanced diet, in reality, it's a diet that consists of grains.

However, we do not necessarily need to eat grains.

In human history, the consumption of grains as a staple food began only recently with the advent of agriculture.

Before that, we lived on meat obtained through hunting and vegetables and fruits gathered through foraging.

Therefore, a diet consisting of 60% carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 20% fat cannot be considered a balanced diet.

That is a diet with too many carbohydrates.

So, what kind of diet is a balanced diet?

We talked about that part in detail in the fourth video of the low-carb, high-fat series.

If you're curious about the related content, the video link is available in the top right corner.

You can click to see it.

Lastly, if insomnia symptoms arise due to dietary issues,

It takes time for the body to get used to new eating habits, so results will appear gradually.

The time it takes varies from person to person.

Some people see results in just a day or two.

Some people may only see results after continuing for more than two weeks.

Don't be too impatient just because you don't see immediate results; please try to be consistent.

Mr. pkang, I have no issues with my eating habits, but I just can't seem to sleep well.

I’m definitely very sleepy and tired, but when I actually lie down to sleep, I can’t fall asleep.

What should I do?

Such phenomena can occur due to smartphones.

In the next video, we will talk about smartphones and sleep.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 4 of the sleep diet.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
