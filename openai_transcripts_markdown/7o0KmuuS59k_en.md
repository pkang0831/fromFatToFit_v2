The topic of this video is "Is meat a carcinogenic food?" and this is the second video on the subject.

I mentioned it in the first part of the video, but a question has come up on the left.

If you haven't watched Part 1 of the video, please pause the screen and check the content of the question.

When meat is stir-fried, it is cooked at high temperatures, and it is said that carcinogens are produced during this process. Is it okay to continue eating it?

The carcinogens mentioned in the question are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about heterocyclic amines.

For those who haven't watched Part 1 of the video, a link is provided in the top right corner, so you can click the link to watch the video.

In this video, I will talk about aromatic hydrocarbons and other carcinogens.

To get straight to the point, in the case of directional hydrocarbons,

If you are eating meat at home for a low-carb, high-fat diet, there is no need to worry.

There are two conditions for occurrence.

The first case is when the meat is in direct contact with the fire.

The second is caused by the fat from the meat dripping onto the charcoal, which produces smoke.

When we stir-fry meat at home, we mostly use a frying pan, right?

So the meat doesn't come into direct contact with the fire, and the fat from the meat doesn't drip onto the charcoal.

Unusually, you grill meat directly over the gas flame at home.

Alternatively, if you insist on grilling with charcoal at home, it could lead to problems.

In reality, it is not common to do things that way, so there is not much need to worry about directional hydrocarbons.

In addition to this, there are many other carcinogens, and hearing about them can cause a lot of worry.

I need information on the actual amount produced and how it affects the body.

It occurs in most cases, but it's said that the amount is not enough to affect the human body.

A representative example is a carcinogen called acrylamide.

Acrylamide is a carcinogenic substance that forms when food is heated.

So when food is heated, carcinogens are produced, which means that eating heated food is not good for health.

Some people argue that it is better to eat food raw without heating it.

However, the amount of acrylamide produced is not high.

Pepper is the food that contains the highest amount of acrylamide.

Pepper basically contains acrylamide, and it is said that when pepper is heated, the content increases by ten times.

So for a while, it is dangerous to sprinkle pepper on meat before grilling it.

It was very famous to grill the meat first and then sprinkle pepper on it before eating.

If you search on YouTube now, related videos will come up.

However, the acrylamide content in pepper is low, so even if it increases tenfold, it is not a dangerous amount.

And the amount of pepper sprinkled on the meat is quite a lot.

If you sprinkle an entire container of pepper on your meat, it can be dangerous because the amount becomes excessive.

However, in reality, since a 20g small container is used in 5 or 6 portions, it does not amount to a dangerous quantity.

For your reference, acrylamide is also produced during the roasting process of coffee beans.

At one point, there was a lot of commotion about classifying coffee as a carcinogenic food.

However, the acrylamide content in coffee is so low that it has not been classified as a carcinogenic food.

To summarize,

It is true that heating meat can produce carcinogenic substances.

However, in most cases, it is difficult to meet the conditions for occurrence, or even if it does occur, the quantity is usually small.

When we say "carcinogen," it sounds very dangerous because it can cause cancer.

It hasn't been long since this substance was discovered.

So, there is currently no data on the actual effects on the human body.

So what do we say causes cancer? It is mostly based on the results of animal experiments.

Since human experimentation is not allowed, experiments are conducted on animals.

The body structure of animals and humans is different, and the human body is several times larger than that of experimental animals.

Even if it is confirmed in experiments that using a specific amount causes cancer,

When I looked at applying it to the human body, I found that the amount is incredibly large, so there are cases where one could eat it for a lifetime without getting cancer.

As mentioned in the first part of the video, eating vegetables has the effect of inhibiting the absorption of carcinogens.

However, the experiment was conducted without eating vegetables.

The experiment itself should be done this way.

The purpose of the experiment is to determine whether carcinogens cause cancer.

Controlling for other variables that are like eating vegetables, while continuously increasing the dosage.

Since the dosage is at this level, it leads to the development of cancer, so this is the result being presented.

The experiment itself is not wrong.

However, in practical application, it is mostly not an issue.

However, even after reviewing the content up to this point, I believe there may still be some people who feel uneasy.

It has not been long since this substance was discovered, and the fact that its effects on the human body have not been confirmed means that

It may be overrated as something very dangerous, even though it is not actually dangerous.

On the contrary, it could be a substance that is lethal to the human body, but it might be underestimated.

And even if it's a quantity that is not harmful to the body, one might think that it's best not to consume it at all.

So regarding this part, I don't want to forcefully say, "It's unnecessary worry, it's okay."

Because everyone has different opinions.

However, if you were to ask me what I think,

From my perspective, when I see this information, I think, "It doesn't seem dangerous," so I feel comfortable eating it.

You understand, right?
