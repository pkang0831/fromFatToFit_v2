Hello, this is pkang.

A comment question asking for ways for thin people to gain weight has been posted, so I'm creating this.

This is the third video of the thin person series.

In Part 1 of the video, there is a discussion about how thin people often hear about ways to gain weight.

We talked about why those methods do not yield the desired results.

In the second part of the video, we discussed the most fundamental reasons why thin people do not gain weight and the solutions to that issue.

The link to the playlist for the video of the thin person is being shared at the top right now.

If you would like to watch the videos in order starting from the one at the front, you can click to view them.

Since the content of the video is continuous, it is recommended to watch it in order if possible.

In the second part of the video, it was mentioned that a thin person needs to exercise in order to gain weight.

In the case of thin individuals, both body fat and muscle mass are very low.

There is a tendency to get easily fatigued due to weak muscles and insufficient glycogen storage.

Moreover, because the absorption rate is low, the amount of food absorbed is small even when eating.

So there is the issue that glycogen replenishment and muscle recovery are slow.

So the more you exercise, the harder it becomes, and it has the characteristic of being difficult to continue.

I heard that exercising actually makes you gain weight, so I started working out.

It is very common for people to quit in the middle due to increasing difficulties and physical pain.

Are you saying that you can't exercise because your absorption rate is low? But isn't it said that exercising increases the absorption rate?

By increasing energy expenditure through exercise and placing a load on the muscles,

It is true that the absorption rate is gradually increasing.

However, it doesn't increase immediately just because you've exercised for a day or two.

If you consistently exercise and gradually increase the load, your absorption rate will slowly improve.

Just because you've worked hard for a day or two doesn't mean you'll see immediate results.

It's not the intensity of the exercise that matters.

Even if the exercise intensity is low, it's important not to give up and to keep going consistently.

If you keep at it consistently, your absorption rate will increase, and if you also improve your eating habits...

The rate of glycogen replenishment is also faster, and the rate of muscle recovery is also quicker.

From here on, the exercise becomes easier, and you'll start to build muscle and gain weight.

Along with consistently exercising, it is essential to improve eating habits.

Every organ in the human body becomes stronger the more it is used.

The less you use it, the weaker it becomes.

And this applies directly to the digestive system as well.

Among thin people, those who have a very small appetite tend to have a very weak digestive system.

Since you don't use it much, your digestive system becomes weaker.

When the digestive system weakens, it cannot properly digest and absorb food.

One reason for the low absorption rate in thin people is that their digestive system is too weak.

In that case, you need to use this digestive system to strengthen it.

The food you eat at this time should not just be unrefined food.

As mentioned in the first part of the video, the meaning of the phrase "I want to gain weight" as expressed by thin people is

It's not that I want to become fat and look chubby.

Right now, I am underweight and too thin, so my body doesn't look good.

What I mean is that I want to gain a little weight to have a nice, slim body.

However, people who are obese are advised to eat unrefined foods in order to achieve a slim and attractive body.

It is quite common to recommend unrefined foods to thin people as well.

However, obese individuals have well-developed digestive systems that effectively digest and absorb food.

That's why you became obese due to the high absorption rate here.

So, eating foods that are easily digestible and unrefined foods that are not easily digestible is...

It has the effect of balancing.

However, thin people have weak digestive systems and low absorption rates.

I am unable to properly digest and absorb food, which is why I am not gaining weight.

If you eat unrefined foods that are hard to digest here, there will be an issue with even worse digestion.

If you want to gain weight, you need to eat a lot and exercise.

Eating processed foods only increases body fat, so eat more clean foods.

Believing in such advice, I ate unrefined foods.

It is very difficult to eat due to indigestion or to complain of abdominal bloating symptoms.

Many people experience abdominal pain or diarrhea.

If your muscles are weak, start with light exercises and as your muscles grow, move on to stronger workouts.

If your digestive system is weak, start with easily digestible foods.

It is correct to eat foods that are difficult to digest after your digestive system has strengthened.

So, are you saying that I should eat processed refined foods like fast food, ham, sausages, bread, and snacks?

It is true that processed refined foods are easy to digest, but...

It is not a food that helps you gain weight healthily because it contains many additives and is not rich in nutrients.

So it's not that I'm saying to eat refined foods.

You can think of it as eating unrefined foods but in a way that makes them easier to digest.

For example, rather than eating vegetables raw,

When cooked or blanched, it has the effect of being easily digested and absorbed.

Drinking juice made by blending vegetables or fruits is also very effective.

When eating brown rice, you can either make it with sprouted brown rice or mix it with white rice.

Eating minced or ground meat is more effective than eating raw meat directly.

If you eat like this, the food itself is nutritious and clean.

It has the characteristic of being easily digested and absorbed.

So even people with weak digestive systems can digest and absorb well enough.

By eating like this, you can strengthen your digestive system, and then you can eat foods that are difficult to digest.

I eat a lot, but I don't gain weight easily.

I usually eat a lot, so my digestive system shouldn't be weak.

So, is it okay if I don't eat like that?

If you actually eat a lot of food, it's because your digestive system is not weak.

You don't need to eat like that.

However, there are quite a few cases where I mistakenly think I eat a lot, even though the actual amount I consume is small.

In the next video, even though I don't eat a lot of food,

I will talk about the misconception of thinking that one eats a lot of food.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the fourth part of the "Skinny Person" series,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
