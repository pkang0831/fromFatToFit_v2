Is there a way to lose weight without experiencing a rebound after starving?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

If you follow a low-calorie diet or starve yourself to lose weight, a hunger response will occur.

When the hunger response occurs, it makes it easier to gain weight.

Dieting becomes increasingly difficult, and it becomes easier to experience weight regain.

There are several videos that include this kind of content.

Whether the views of those videos have increased.

I lost weight by starving myself, but please tell me how to avoid gaining it back.

Please help me, as if you are saving a life.

There have been quite a few comments with this kind of content.

In this video, let's talk about starvation diets and yo-yo dieting.

Many people use the term "yo-yo," but it is often used with different meanings.

It can be broadly divided into two meanings.

The first meaning refers to an increase in weight based on the current weight after dieting.

For example, a person who weighed 60kg lost weight down to 50kg through dieting.

If my weight increases back to 55kg,

A 5kg yo-yo has come, a slight yo-yo has come. This is how we express it.

The second meaning refers to weighing more than the weight measured before starting a diet.

For example, a person who weighed 60kg lost weight down to 50kg through dieting.

It means that the weight will increase up to 65 kg.

Originally, the yo-yo only had the second meaning.

Many people use it in the first meaning as well.

Recently, both are referred to as yo-yo.

First, if we consider the first meaning of a yo-yo, it is impossible to stop it completely.

You will definitely experience a 100% yo-yo effect.

This is because most of the weight gain is due to body water.

I have mentioned it a few times in other videos as well.

The factors that most significantly affect changes in body water are carbohydrates and sodium.

The carbohydrates we consume are stored in the body as glycogen.

Glycogen is stored along with water when it is stored.

Sodium in our body always tries to maintain a constant concentration.

When you eat salty food, a lot of sodium enters your body, which increases body fluid.

Simply put, consuming a lot of carbohydrates and salt increases body water.

Eating less carbohydrates and salt will lead to a reduction in body water.

If you diet by significantly reducing your food intake, such as through starvation diets or low-calorie diets,

Since the amount of food has decreased, the intake of carbohydrates and salt naturally decreases as well.

Then, as body water decreases, weight will also drop.

When doing a starvation diet or a low-calorie diet.

The reason for rapid weight loss in the initial stages is

This is because the body water is being lost.

On the contrary, if you stop a starvation diet or a low-calorie diet and increase your food intake,

You naturally end up eating a bit more carbohydrates and salt.

When you consume more carbohydrates and salt, your body water increases rapidly.

Your weight will increase by the amount of weight from the increased body water.

There is no way to prevent this.

When you consume carbohydrates and salt, your body water increases.

Isn't it enough to just follow a low-carb or low-sodium diet?

Unfortunately, that's not the case.

In the first place, humans need carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and salt.

When restrictions are artificially imposed, the desire to eat it gradually increases.

In reality, when you try to limit fat for a low-calorie diet, the desire to eat greasy foods increases.

If you try to limit carbohydrates for a low-carb diet, the desire to eat carbohydrate-rich foods increases.

Even if I limit salt, I still crave it.

I can't suppress that desire for a lifetime.

At some point, you have to eat carbohydrates and salt.

Then, at some point, the body water will increase.

The important point here is that body water increases, not body fat.

So to be precise, it's not that I'm gaining weight.

However, it's not just the weight that increases; the body also becomes bulkier.

Yes, that's right.

Body water not only has weight but also has volume.

The body will become thicker by the volume of body water.

So whether body water increases or body fat increases, isn't it the same anyway?

Losing body fat means that you are on a diet and that you have actually lost weight.

On the other hand, a decrease in body water means that body water has decreased, not that body fat has been lost.

So it's not a diet.

So I went on a diet by starving myself and became slim.

I gained weight and became obese after eating food. This is not it.

I used to be overweight, but I've lost water weight and am pretending to be slim now.

As the body water levels returned to normal, it became evident that there was obesity.

You need to be clearly aware of this. It's really important.

Second

The yo-yo effect of gaining more weight than before dieting.

This can be prevented.

Because just because it's a starvation diet doesn't mean that body fat doesn't decrease at all.

At first, body fat decreases, but then...

As the period of fasting extends, hunger responses arise, leading to problems.

So, it means that compared to before starting the diet, the body fat has decreased.

Gaining more weight than before starting a diet means that

This means that body fat is likely to increase more.

However, body fat does not decrease quickly, nor does it increase quickly.

It takes quite a bit of time for this to happen.

So, the yo-yo effect caused by water retention that I mentioned earlier...

You can quickly gain 2 to 3 kg by eating just one meal.

Because it is moisture, the changes happen quickly.

However, the yo-yo effect of increasing body fat does not happen that quickly.

By eating fattening foods for a long time, frequently, and in large amounts, the yo-yo effect gradually starts to occur.

But something seems off.

If someone has been on a diet, they would dislike gaining weight.

In that case, even if you eat foods that make you gain weight,

When you gain weight, you need to stop and go on a diet again.

Why does body fat continue to increase to the point of experiencing a yo-yo effect?

There are two main factors here.

The first factor is giving up on dieting.

The second factor is that taste changes.

Earlier, I mentioned that it's important to properly understand the yo-yo effect caused by body water.

Because if you don't know about the yo-yo effect caused by body water...

This is because there can be an obsession with the act of eating itself.

In a state where body water has decreased due to starvation dieting.

When you eat, your body water increases, and your weight can rise by 2 to 3 kg in a day.

If you don't know that this is body water, you'll be extremely shocked.

I barely lost weight after starving for several months, but after just one meal, I gained 2 to 3 kg.

If you starve again, while body water will be lost and weight will return,

When I eat food, I gain another 2 to 3 kg.

Eating food itself becomes a source of stress, and gradually, it leads to an obsession.

Then, when you reach your limit, you end up binge eating.

I sometimes give up on my diet and binge eat.

Otherwise, my mind goes blank, and I sometimes lose my reason and binge eat.

However, the bigger problem is that the foods we binge on during this time are mostly fattening foods.

When you go on a starvation diet and experience hunger responses, your taste buds change to prefer those kinds of foods.

So if you've lost weight by starving yourself and want to prevent rebound weight gain,

You need to understand the yo-yo effect caused by body water and accept it as it is.

It's the body water that has increased, not the body fat.

So I haven't gained weight.

If your body looks swollen due to increased body water,

It's not because of the food I just ate that I gained weight.

I originally had a chubby body, but I lost water weight, so it looks like I'm not.

You need to acknowledge and accept that in order to avoid developing an obsession with eating.

You must avoid developing obsessions to prevent a greater yo-yo effect.

This part is the most important.

If that part has been resolved, now it's time to eat.

Try to eat unrefined foods as much as possible.

If you have been on a starvation diet for a long time, your basal metabolic rate may have decreased significantly.

The digestive system is also quite weakened.

Eating unrefined foods can be daunting.

Then, grind, chop, and crush unrefined foods.

It's good to prepare food in a way that doesn't put a strain on the digestive system.

And if the basal metabolic rate has decreased, then the active metabolic rate has also decreased.

You need to consciously move your body to increase your metabolic rate.

You don't need to work out hard from the very beginning.

It is difficult to do and doesn't go well.

First of all, it is important to recover the body.

Walking for about 10 minutes after a meal is sufficient.

Walking for 10 minutes after a meal is good for dieting in itself.

It also helps to increase the lowered metabolic rate.

This is the method that minimizes the yo-yo effect.

So, what is unrefined food?

I previously made a video explaining unrefined foods in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have a video that explains unprocessed foods in detail appear in the top left.

If you are not familiar with unrefined foods, you can click here to learn more.

You mentioned that if you go on a diet by starving yourself, your taste buds will change to prefer foods that make you gain weight.

Why does it change like that?

This is because the basal metabolic rate decreases, leading to a decline in the function of the digestive system.

There was a story sent by a former flight attendant that I explained in detail before.

I will make sure to display related videos in the upper right corner.

The video also includes methods to restore a lowered basal metabolic rate.

If you need help, you can click here to see it.

You mentioned that walking for 10 minutes after a meal is good for dieting. Could you please explain that in more detail?

I will make sure to include a video in the bottom left that explains walking after meals in detail.
