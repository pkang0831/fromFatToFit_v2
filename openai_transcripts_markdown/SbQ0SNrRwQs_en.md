An experiment where just changing thoughts led to weight loss - Thought Diet Part 3

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video about thoughts on dieting.

In the first part of the video, it discusses overeating due to optical illusions.

In the second part of the video, we talked about how the perception of calories creates hunger.

In this video, I would like to talk about an experiment that shows how simply changing your mindset can lead to weight loss.

There was a saying on a Korean TV broadcast in the past that "labor and exercise are different."

The process that led to this statement is interesting.

At the time that statement was made, the calorie diet theory was being trusted.

The prevailing opinion was that in order to diet, one must increase calorie expenditure through exercise.

So there were quite a few shows introducing various types of exercise.

One of the participants here begins to have doubts.

If you exercise and burn a lot of calories, then your body fat decreases and you lose weight.

The question is, why do people who expend a lot of energy in their daily activities still become obese?

Rather than people who work in office jobs sitting down to do their work,

A person working in a physical job uses much more energy.

If the concept is that increasing the energy consumed through exercise leads to weight loss, then...

People who work in field jobs should relatively be thinner than those who work in office jobs.

It is not actually the case.

The expert's response during the broadcast was, "Labor and exercise are different."

There was no explanation for why those two things are different, but

Because it was said by an expert, many people accepted it as it was.

I believed that working labor does not help with dieting.

But is that really the case?

A popular exercise for dieting in Korea recently is stair climbing.

To do this exercise, there is a tool called a step box, and there are also machines that have an endless supply of stairs.

However, climbing stairs is something we often do in our daily lives, even if it's not considered exercise.

In that case, if the same action is labeled as exercise, it leads to weight loss.

If we don't call it exercise, will we not lose weight?

This story is somewhat difficult to understand.

Isn't it true that exercising with the correct posture is what makes it effective?

It's not from the perspective of calorie consumption.

The reason why it's important to maintain the correct posture while exercising is that...

Exercising with improper posture increases the likelihood of injury.

It is an exercise done to stimulate a specific area.

This is because it may not be able to provide the proper stimulation.

However, from the perspective of energy consumption,

No matter what position you are in or how you move, once you start moving, energy is consumed.

Therefore, if the concept is to lose weight by increasing energy expenditure, then no matter how you move, you should lose weight.

But why did the expert who appeared on the broadcast say, "Labor and exercise are different"?

It is because I did not know why there is no difference between field workers and office workers.

So I just answered that it's different.

And this statement had a very negative impact on people who are dieting.

There is an interesting experiment that was conducted in the United States related to this.

In the case of hotel housekeepers, they burn a significant amount of calories through their labor.

The sheets and blankets in the hotel are all thick and heavy.

Pushing a cart filled with it around.

Lifting a large, heavy mattress to put in and take out the sheets is very difficult.

When calculated in calories, it is said that about 300 calories are burned in one hour.

It's not the case that I only work for one hour a day.

When considering the total calories consumed in a day,

Burns more calories than someone who exercises for 1 to 2 hours.

However, when the health status of housekeepers working in hotels in the United States was checked,

I checked blood pressure, body weight, and the ratio of waist to hips, but there was no difference compared to office workers.

From what we've seen so far, the energy expended by housekeepers through labor is

It seems like it hasn't had any effect on the diet.

However, if the energy expended through labor and the energy expended through exercise are the same, then there is no difference.

You are expending a lot of energy through labor, and this is no different from exercise.

What would happen if you let me know like this?

In the experiment, a poster was created to inform about the calories burned while doing housekeeper tasks.

I informed the housekeepers that the work they do burns a lot of calories.

And four weeks later, I gathered the housekeepers to check their health status once again.

Interestingly, the results showed that my weight and body fat have decreased, and I have successfully lost weight.

So, are you saying that by just changing your mindset while living the same way, you were able to lose weight?

It could be, or it might not be.

In that experiment, only the poster was provided, and no other conditions were added.

They claim that just changing their mindset is enough for dieting, but...

Because it was not an experiment conducted in a controlled situation.

I cannot tell whether the food you eat or your lifestyle patterns have been maintained or changed.

For example, I want to diet, but I'm busy and it's tough, so I've given up on dieting.

I heard that a lot of calories are burned through work.

I feel like I can go on a diet.

You may have started a diet or worked harder.

Of course, if all other conditions remain unchanged and only the mindset has changed, it is possible that weight loss has occurred.

However, the question of which of these two is correct is not an important issue.

The important thing is that there is no difference between the calories burned through labor and the calories burned through exercise.

This means that it had a positive effect on the diet.

So I can't diet for these reasons. I can't diet for those reasons.

Rather than having such thoughts, even small actions can help with dieting.

I can diet anytime and in any situation.

Having this kind of mindset is said to have a positive effect on dieting.

Just having this thought can lead to weight loss.

Thanks to this kind of thinking, it might lead to starting a diet.

Please try to start with something small.

From this perspective, we can understand why the statement "work and exercise are different" is not beneficial for dieting.

However, it's not just that one word that negatively affects our diet.

In the next video, we will discuss diet information that negatively impacts dieting.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the fourth part of the Thought Diet series,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
