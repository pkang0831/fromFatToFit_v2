The topic of this video is whether hamburgers are fattening foods.

There are many opinions on whether you gain weight or not when you only eat hamburgers on the internet.

I will talk about this in detail.

Food that is cooked quickly, like a hamburger, and can be eaten easily is called fast food.

The most famous video related to fast food in the country is

This is a documentary video titled "Super Size Me."

If you have all three meals a day at McDonald's fast food.

With the intention of observing how our bodies change.

The protagonist actually carries out the mission.

To get straight to the point, body fat has significantly increased.

I received a diagnosis from the hospital that my health has worsened.

Fast food has strongly instilled the perception that it is harmful to our bodies.

Based on this, hamburgers are not good for the body. Many people claim that eating hamburgers makes you gain weight.

There are many arguments that counter this.

"Super Size Me" is not saying that fast food is bad for the body, but rather...

It is a claim that the movie exposes the problem of a sales model that promotes super-sizing.

Supersize refers to a larger portion of fries and cola compared to the regular set.

The protagonist of the movie does not order the super size first.

When the clerk asks, "Would you like to super-size that?"

At that time, I answered "yes" and made sure to eat it all.

I was asked if I would like to super-size most of my orders.

Most people say they had a supersized meal.

This type of business model at McDonald's is encouraging people's obesity.

So, we made a movie with the intention of conveying that this is not how business should be conducted.

So the claim is that the movie title is "Super Size Me."

After the movie became an issue, McDonald's removed the supersize option.

The second argument is not about the problem of hamburgers.

The problem is with the cola and potatoes that are eaten with the hamburger.

If you eat just a hamburger without cola and fries, you won't gain weight.

Because except for some products that contain a lot of cheese.

Most hamburgers contain only 400 to 500 kcal, so they are not high-calorie foods.

Even when looking at the nutrition label, it is food that contains a balanced amount of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

And instead of having the hamburger as a set, I had it with just a single item along with coffee, milk, and water.

There are also reviews saying that they lost weight.

Based on this, people say that hamburgers are good or bad.

I would like to talk about hamburgers from a different perspective.

In order to absorb energy from food, we must go through the digestion process.

Food is chewed in the mouth, broken down in the stomach, absorbed in the small intestine, and water is absorbed in the large intestine before being excreted.

The digestion process does not occur for free; it requires time and energy.

And the time and energy are applied differently depending on the structure of the food's composition.

Foods with a firm structure require a lot of energy to digest and have a longer digestion time.

This is a food that is good for a long-lasting feeling of fullness, which we often refer to as satiety, in a diet.

On the other hand, foods with a broken combination structure have a shorter digestion time and consume less energy.

This is what we commonly refer to as food that is not good for dieting.

A typical example is white rice and brown rice.

White rice and brown rice are both rice. White rice is simply brown rice with the outer husk removed.

When eating brown rice, the body needs to use a lot of digestive energy to break down the brown rice husk.

Because it takes a long time for the skin to peel off.

Digestion progresses slowly, leading to prolonged feelings of fullness, and it also results in a gradual increase in blood sugar levels.

On the other hand, white rice has already had its husk removed.

Because less digestive energy is used and digestion occurs quickly, blood sugar levels increase rapidly.

So, even though it's the same rice, brown rice with the husk is a good food for dieting.

White rice without the husk is classified as food that is not good for dieting.

The bread used for the hamburger is made from ground wheat, and the patty is made from minced meat, right?

Because the food has a highly broken-down structure, there is a problem that it is quickly digested and absorbed when eaten.

So, it is not a good food for dieting.

Then why do some people lose weight while eating hamburgers?

Because hamburgers are digested quickly, after a little while, a feeling of hunger will come.

At this time, I endure my hunger and do not eat.

As I mentioned at the beginning of the video, hamburgers are not foods that are high in calories.

The low-calorie diet can lead to weight loss.

Sounds plausible, right?
