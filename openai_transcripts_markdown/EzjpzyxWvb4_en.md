Can you escape a plateau by eating what you want on a cheat day? - Cheat Day Part 3

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the third video about cheat day.

In the first video, I talked about the types and effects of cheat days.

In the second video, we talked about whether a cheat day can prevent a decrease in basal metabolic rate.

In this video, I would like to talk about how to overcome a plateau with a cheat day.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it is better to watch them in order.

If you haven't watched the previous video, you can click the link in the top right corner and watch them in order.

There are several reasons why a plateau occurs when we are on a diet.

One of them is the deficiency of a specific nutrient.

In the past, it was believed that consuming fewer calories from food was necessary for dieting.

So when it comes to a diet plan, I tried to avoid consuming high-calorie fats as much as possible.

A low-calorie diet is essentially a low-fat diet.

Recently, it has become known that excessive carbohydrates are a cause of obesity.

If it's a diet plan, I try to eat less carbohydrates.

That's why low-carb diets are trending.

The cause of obesity ultimately comes down to overeating, which is consuming too much food.

Therefore, it is important not to eat too much, whether it's carbohydrates or fats.

So if you are overeating, it is correct to reduce your intake to an appropriate amount instead of continuing to overeat.

There are quite a few cases where I try to eat as little as possible or not eat at all beyond this.

If the cause of obesity is carbohydrates or fats,

It's because they believe that eating less of it or not eating it at all will have a stronger dieting effect.

However, in order for a person to live, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are all necessary.

When these nutrients are lacking, our body reacts by trying to compensate for them.

One of those reactions leads to a stagnation period.

There are two main ways for our bodies to obtain the nutrients they lack.

The first method is to increase appetite by eating foods rich in lacking nutrients.

The second method is to maximize the absorption of nutrients from the food you have already eaten.

If a deficiency in nutrients occurs due to the first method, it makes you crave foods rich in those nutrients.

So when I follow a low-carb diet, I crave foods that are rich in carbohydrates.

When following a low-calorie diet, you tend to crave rich, fatty foods.

The second method can lead to increased absorption rates or cause constipation.

Whether you are on a low-calorie diet or a low-carbohydrate diet, everyone experiences some symptoms of constipation.

What is absorption rate?

When we eat food, it is broken down and absorbed through the digestive system.

The amount absorbed at this time is not always the same.

The amount that can be absorbed changes depending on the situation, and this is called the absorption rate.

I am following a diet that restricts certain nutrients.

So when my body is in a state of deficiency of that nutrient,

Our body tries to absorb as many of those nutrients as possible.

So it increases the absorption rate.

The problem is that the absorption rate of the digestive system is increasing.

It means that I cannot selectively increase the absorption rate of only the nutrients I need.

For example, if the body becomes deficient in carbohydrates due to a low-carbohydrate diet,

To obtain that carbohydrate, the absorption rate increases.

At this time, a lot of protein and fat are also absorbed along with carbohydrates.

This means that a stagnation period can occur because of this.

To resolve the stagnation caused by the increased absorption rate,

We need to fill in the lacking nutrients and lower the absorption rate again.

The plateau caused by a low-calorie diet can be resolved by consuming fats.

The stagnation caused by low carbohydrates will be resolved by consuming carbohydrates.

However, there are quite a few cases where people misunderstand this as being thanks to cheat days.

This is because the situation of consuming lacking nutrients mainly occurs on cheat days.

People who believe that eating fewer carbohydrates is the key to dieting

When I reach a plateau in my diet, I try to restrict carbohydrates even more.

I believe that restricting carbohydrates is necessary for dieting.

However, the root cause of the plateau is the severe restriction of carbohydrates.

Restricting carbohydrates further does not resolve the plateau.

Because carbohydrates are restricted, the desire for carbohydrates is increasing.

I am enduring such desires with strong willpower.

Since I'm stuck in a plateau, I'm not able to lose weight, so there are no rewards.

If this situation continues, eventually your willpower will break, and you'll end up having a cheating day.

And during this time, the food consumed on a cheating day naturally tends to be high in carbohydrates.

Because by restricting carbohydrates, the desire for carbohydrates has increased.

So I want to eat foods that are high in carbohydrates.

If it's a cheat day where you can eat anything, of course, I would eat carbohydrates.

And when this happens, the stagnation will naturally be resolved.

It was a plateau caused by a lack of carbohydrates, but it was resolved by eating carbohydrates.

The problem is that after having a cheat day, I start to think that my plateau has been broken.

This is a misunderstanding.

I will summarize.

When we are on a diet, if we severely restrict certain nutrients,

This can lead to a stagnation period.

When you have a cheat day during such a plateau situation, the plateau may break, but...

This cannot be considered a unique effect of a cheat day.

There were nutrients missing in my diet, and because of that, I experienced a plateau.

By filling in that nutrient, the stagnation has been resolved.

In other words

If you follow a diet that doesn't restrict specific nutrients from the beginning, it is possible to avoid plateaus.

Of course, there can be stagnation periods caused by other factors.

This is not fundamentally a problem with the diet, so even if you have a cheat day, it won't resolve the plateau.

So, what should a diet without plateaus look like?

I previously made a video about a diet without plateaus.

At the end of this video, I will make sure to include the link to that video.

So, in the end, it means that a cheat day doesn't even help resolve a plateau?

So, does it have the effect of relieving stress?

When you are on a diet, stress tends to build up.

Cheat days relieve that stress and allow you to continue with your diet.

I heard that a cheat day is really necessary...

This is a commonly used explanation for why a cheat day is necessary.

That also has some issues.

In fact, it's not necessarily good for dieting.

In the next video, I will discuss why using a cheat day to relieve stress can be problematic.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

On the left, make sure to display a video about a diet without stagnation.

On the right, I will have videos about cheat days and stress.

You can click on the video you're curious about to watch it.

However, the video on the right is one that needs to be created in the future, so it will take some time.

If the video on the right is not part 4 of the cheating day, please wait a few more days.
