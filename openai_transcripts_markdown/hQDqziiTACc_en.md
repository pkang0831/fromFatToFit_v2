The theme of this video is God.

Before we start the video,

In my case, I am not someone who believes in any particular religion.

That doesn't mean I deny religion.

I often go to the temple with my parents.

I have a friend among my friends who goes to church.

Would you like to go to church together sometime? Then we can go to church.

If a friend who goes to church asks, "Would you like to visit the church?"

I sometimes follow the church.

And then, since I went...

I also sing along to the songs that come out of there enthusiastically.

The things you say... have a lot of good advice. That's why I tend to listen carefully.

I'm not denying religion, but I'm not really immersed in any particular faith.

So when asked, I answer that I am non-religious.

My position on the existence of God is that I believe God may or may not exist.

There is no clear evidence to definitively say that something exists or does not exist.

You can think of it as a neutral position.

The reason I brought up the topic of God is because...

I saw a very interesting article on the internet.

While thinking about that writing, I decided to make a video.

First of all, in certain religions, it is said that the existence of God is

All-knowing and without ignorance.

All-powerful and capable of doing anything.

Love for humanity

They say they want to eliminate evil from this world.

I won't specifically mention what religion it is, but...

There are religions that say God is like this.

It is the religion that you think of.

However, the person who wrote that post on the internet said that

These four conditions are interconnected in some way.

It was stated that it is impossible to establish it all at once.

That content is very interesting.

What it is about is

Send the valid cards to the left.

I will send the invalid cards to the right.

God wants to eliminate evil from this world.

If one does not know how to eliminate that evil, then God is not omniscient.

Omniscience: Absolute knowledge that knows everything.

Omniscience refers to having absolute knowledge of everything.

I want to eliminate evil, but I don't know how.

This means that God is not omnipotent.

The second god wants to eliminate evil from this world.

I know how to do it thoroughly.

If you lack the strength to carry out this method,

God is not omnipotent.

Omnipotence: Absolute power that can do anything.

That's right? Being omnipotent refers to having absolute power that can do anything.

I know how to eliminate evil, but at this point, I lack the strength to carry out that method.

This means that God is not omnipotent.

And the third god, being omniscient, knows how to eliminate evil from this world.

If you are omnipotent and have enough power to carry out that method.

Why is there evil in this world?

That's right? You want to eliminate evil, but...

If you know the method and are omnipotent, then you have enough power to carry out that method.

You can just eliminate evil.

However, evil clearly exists in this world.

In other words, it means that God does not want to eliminate evil.

And it is said in that religion that

The existence of evil is something that tempts humans and leads them to corruption.

At the point of not wanting to eliminate this existence.

It could be said that God may not love humans.

So, these four cards are interconnected in this way.

It is impossible for all of them to be established at the same time.

Therefore, the content of the writing was that what is said in that religion lacks credibility.

Of course, those who believe in that religion...

I think you will have a lot of counterarguments to make.

Anyway, it seems that there are no logical errors in the story structure.

It sounds quite plausible.

And although I am not a person who believes in that religion,

I started to think about how I could reverse this.

Is there a story where all four of these conditions are met?

I started to think about it on my own.

Interestingly, you can find that answer in a movie.

It's a religious movie, and I find answers in the film "Evan Almighty."

So, what kind of movie is "Evan Almighty"?

Some of you may have seen this movie.

However, since there may be some who haven't seen it, let me briefly explain the plot.

The character Evan, who appears as the protagonist, is a very successful person in society.

This person has one concern, and that concern is what?

The relationship with my family isn't very good.

In order to achieve social success, I end up working very hard.

There is less and less time to spend with family.

Therefore, the relationship with the family is likely becoming increasingly distant.

So, this Evan is going to make a wish to God.

I wish to improve my relationship with my family.

And with a very fun message that grants this wish.

I am sending a message to build an ark.

Of course, from Evan's perspective, it's something to be frustrated about.

I don't even know what the relationship is between building an ark and getting along better with my family.

From the beginning, the character Evan has never even tried to sew.

I am someone who has no connection to making boats at all.

So even after hearing the command to build the ark, I don't think about making it.

I think I'm not going to do it.

From this day on, strange things start happening to Evan.

The wood needed to build this ark at home is continuously being delivered.

And suddenly, a pair of male and female sheep starts to appear in the car that Evan is driving.

And starting from this, various animals pair up as male and female.

I start to keep chasing after Evan.

This is not where it ends.

Here you can see that Evan is someone who always keeps his shaving very neat and tidy.

No matter how hard I shave, my beard grows out so thickly like this.

This is gradually becoming like Noah from Noah's Ark.

After shaving this, I turned my head away from the mirror.

When I look in the mirror again, my beard has grown back like this.

Animals keep following me, materials are being delivered to the house, and my beard keeps growing.

As this situation continues to happen repeatedly,

Evan was pushed into a situation where he could no longer work at his job.

In the end, you will lose your job.

Well, now that I've lost my job...

In the end, Evan is pushed into a situation where he has no choice but to build the ark.

So in the end, we are starting to build the ark.

Even those who do not believe in that religion are likely to have a general idea about the story of Noah's Ark.

Because a person named Noah and every plant and animal on Earth must be able to fit into pairs.

Building a very large ship is the task of making Noah's Ark.

Therefore, it is something that Evan cannot do alone.

So, I will ask my family for help.

And of course, the family gets annoyed too.

My family also has no experience in boat making.

I don't know why I have to do this.

Something strange is happening to my father.

Because of that, my father asks for help, and in the end, I end up helping him.

And Evan spent a very long time with his family for the first time.

Doing hard work together and sharing sincere stories.

It becomes an opportunity to get closer to family.

In this way, Evan made a wish.

The wish to improve my relationship with my family will come true.

In the latter part of the movie, there is a scene where Evan meets God.

And Evan asks God.

Why did you ask me to build an ark?

At this time, God's answer is very interesting.

What I'm saying is

If someone wants to get close to their family,

If you wish to become closer to your family,

I snap my fingers to manipulate people's hearts.

So, should I try to improve my relationship with my family?

Or should I create a situation that could improve my relationship with my family?

And it is a story that appears very frequently in all religious films.

It talks about free will.

Free will: The power to think, decide, and act independently.

The power to think, decide, and act independently.

This is one aspect of the nature that humans possess.

It is said that God cannot interfere with this power.

When watching various religious films, you often come across themes related to free will.

Everything must be included at least once.

And interestingly enough,

When you introduce this concept of free will,

The four cards of omniscience, omnipotence, love, and destruction that were mentioned earlier.

It becomes possible to send everything to the left.

Now, let's take a look at these four cards.

I will try to send everything to the left.

First, in order to do that, we need to examine the relationship between free will and evil.

I mentioned it at the beginning of the video, but...

The concept of evil refers to a being that tempts humans and leads them to corruption.

However, just because this evil tempts us, it doesn't mean that all humans will inevitably fall into corruption.

When the existence of evil tempted.

Those who have made the decision to succumb to the temptation of evil.

Because they fall into evil and become corrupted.

The reason why evil can actually exist is

Strictly speaking, it is because humans have free will.

Believing in evil and not believing in it.

Both believing in God and denying God.

It all comes down to the idea that everyone has free will.

So, if we proceed with the discussion based on this concept,

It becomes possible for all four cards to move to the left.

God wants to eliminate evil from this world.

Do you know how to do it?

As I mentioned earlier, the reason evil can exist in the first place is...

It is because humans have free will that they can succumb to the temptation of evil and fall into corruption.

On the contrary, if humans do not have free will,

Then evil cannot tempt humans.

In other words, it means that evil cannot exist in this world.

Can the second god, being omnipotent, take away free will from humans?

Is it possible? God is the being who created all things in this world.

Even humans were created by God.

I think taking away free will from humans is not such a difficult task.

If it is from someone who is already established and active.

If it is said that it is impossible to extract only freedom,

Like what was done on Noah's Ark.

To cover the entire world with water and kill all humans.

If we create humans without free will, we can fill this world with them, right?

Of course, this method is not a matter of right or wrong.

It means that there is enough strength to do that.

If you really want to eliminate evil, there is a way to do that.

Then the third one.

If God were omniscient and took away free will from humans, knowing that it could eliminate evil,

If you are omnipotent and have the power to do so.

The answer to the question, "Why is there evil in this world?" is

Just think about what a human without free will would be like.

As I mentioned earlier, free will is...

It refers to the power of humans to think, make decisions, and act on their own.

On the contrary, the absence of free will means that

Humans themselves cannot even think.

Unable to decide.

We are talking about a being that cannot take action.

God thinks this way, decides this way, and acts this way.

Everyone must give orders, and humans blindly follow them.

It means becoming a kind of puppet.

However, this is not what God desires.

"Live in the world I created with your own will," is the will of God.

Why does God desire such things from humans?

It is because God loves humans.

So God wants to eliminate evil from this world.

I know that one way to eliminate that evil is to take away free will from humans, but...

Although omnipotent, it can take away free will from humans.

If you say it in a way that you can't do that because you love humanity,

It becomes possible for all four cards to move to the left.

Isn't it fun?

Of course, I'm not sure if this is a religiously correct interpretation, but...

The person who wrote the internet post that appeared at the beginning of the video.

Regarding the fact that the four cards can never go to the left.

It's the result of contemplating whether I could send all four chapters with a different story.

So please don't view it from a strictly religious perspective.

Ah, if I think like this, it seems possible to send all four chapters to the left.

I hope you can enjoy it for fun.

Anyway, it sounds plausible, right?
