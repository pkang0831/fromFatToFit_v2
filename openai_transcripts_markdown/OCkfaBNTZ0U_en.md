How has everyone been?

All videos have subtitles. If you can't see the subtitles, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This video is a survival report video.

There haven't been any video uploads for about two months recently.

As a result, I'm wondering if there's something wrong or if I'm sick, or if I'm just stopping YouTube altogether.

There were many comments expressing concern like this.

Many people have been waiting to see when the new video will be uploaded.

I didn't quit YouTube or anything; I'm not sick or having any problems.

Recently, I've been very busy with personal matters, so I haven't had enough time to create videos.

Since I have to choose the subject of the video, write the script, record, and edit everything by myself,

Creating a video takes longer than I expected.

So, I am planning to change the way I upload videos.

Until now, I have been creating videos whenever I had time and uploading them right away.

If you do it this way, when you have some free time, uploads will happen at intervals of one every two days or one every three days.

When personal matters arise or I get busy like now, the period during which I can't upload videos tends to get longer.

So from now on, I plan to create videos and then schedule them for upload at intervals.

Videos are not uploaded as frequently as before, but...

I’m trying to make sure that the gap without new videos doesn’t get too long like it is now.

I think this way is better than just waiting aimlessly.

I am very grateful to everyone who has shown interest, offered support, and expressed concern in the comments.

I am very grateful to those who support us with a simple sponsorship membership without any special benefits.

I followed along with the video and lost weight. Thank you so much to those who supported me with donations.

Please take care of your health and be happy.

I will return with the next video.

Thank you.
