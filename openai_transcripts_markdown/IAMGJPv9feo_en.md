Hello, this is pkang.

A question about how thin people can gain weight has been posted in the comments, so I'm creating this.

This is the fourth video about thin people.

In the first part of the video, when a thin person talked about wanting to gain weight,

The advice you hear most often, and even if you act according to that advice,

I talked about why I couldn't achieve the desired results.

In the second part of the video, we will discuss the fundamental reasons why thin people do not gain weight and the solutions to this issue.

In Part 3 of the video, we talked about the correct exercise methods and eating habits.

The playlist link is currently displayed in the top right.

If you would like to see it in order starting from Part 1, you can click to view it.

Since the content of the video is all connected, it is recommended to watch it in order if possible.

Among thin people, there are those who have no appetite and eat little, which is why they are thin.

There are thin people who eat a lot of food but do not gain weight.

In the case of thin people who eat little, if they simply increase their food intake,

Due to various issues, the amount you eat should be gradually increased using the method from Part 3.

People who normally eat a lot but do not gain weight do not need to use the methods in Part 3.

In this case, you can increase the absorption rate using the method shown in the second part of the video.

The problem is that the actual amount of food consumed is not very large.

This is a case where I mistakenly think that I eat a lot of food.

In this video, I will talk about that misconception.

The first reason for the misunderstanding is

It is the reaction of those around you due to the instinct to defend oneself and the resulting distortion of memories.

People have an instinct to unconsciously hide their shortcomings.

When a person with obesity eats with others, they try to reduce the amount of food they consume.

Such reactions can occur both consciously and unconsciously.

In cases where it appears consciously,

If I eat a lot, people around me will look at me negatively, so I think I should intentionally eat just a little.

I am consciously reducing the amount I eat.

What appears unconsciously is that I have no intention of reducing the amount I eat in front of others at all.

Strangely, when I eat with friends, I quickly feel full and end up eating less.

Normally, I would eat a little more even if I'm full.

When I'm with my friends, if I'm full, I don't feel like eating anymore.

This is not that I am trying to eat less, but rather that I end up eating less unconsciously.

If this situation keeps happening, I will become the friend who eats very little but doesn't lose weight.

If I keep hearing such stories from my friend, I start to think that I really am that kind of person.

And when a person develops a belief, if information that contradicts that belief arises,

There are many cases where one experiences a distortion of memory, either by ignoring it or failing to recognize it.

So when I think that I eat very little but still don't lose weight, I get caught up in this thought.

I remember eating a lot of food by myself, or sometimes I get confused about the snacks I eat in between.

In reality, many people experience such distortions of memory.

So when you write a food diary that says to record everything you eat,

I often found myself surprised by how much food I eat.

So at one point, just writing a food diary was enough.

There was talk about being able to control the amount you eat and go on a diet.

This applies equally to thin people as well.

From the perspective of a thin person, hearing "You're too skinny" or "You should eat more and gain some weight" is a significant source of stress.

So when I'm with other people, I unconsciously try to eat a lot.

If this situation continues to repeat, I will become the person among my friends who can eat a lot without gaining weight.

If I keep hearing stories like this, I start to believe that it's really true.

So, even though the actual amount of food they eat is small, they have the illusion that they are eating a lot.

If you are worried that you might be under this kind of illusion,

Keeping a food diary allows for objective comparisons.

The second case is when food is consumed all at once.

What this means is that... the actual amount of food consumed is large, but...

This is a case where the frequency of eating that food is low.

For example, I order two servings of delivery food and eat it all by myself.

I don't eat anything else all day long except for that.

Even though I ate a lot of late-night snacks the previous day, there are times when I end up fasting all day the next day because of it.

In this case, the amount of food actually consumed in one meal is quite large.

Even if you keep a food diary, it will still indicate that there is a lot of food.

However, the actual amount of food that is absorbed by the body is not very large.

Because there is a limit to a person's digestive capacity,

Just because you eat a lot of food at once, it doesn't mean that all of it gets digested and absorbed.

Only the amount of food that can be digested is digested and absorbed, while the rest is expelled from the body.

So it means that you eat a lot but don't gain weight.

In the past, there was even a diet called the Nobleman's Diet that utilized this aspect.

You can eat as much as you want, regardless of the type and amount of food, but the method requires that you only eat one meal a day.

Even if you eat a lot, not everything gets digested and absorbed, so there was actually an effect of dieting.

I can eat as much of any food as I want until I'm stuffed.

It is a diet that brings a lot of satisfaction and has gained a lot of popularity for a while.

In fact, singer Hong Jin-young mentioned on the show "Radio Star" that she lost weight using this method.

I heard that you also lost weight.

The problem is that eating a lot of food at once puts a strain on the digestive system, which is not good for health.

Even though the amount consumed is large, most of it is not digested or absorbed, leading to the same problems as a low-calorie diet.

As muscle loss occurs and absorption rates increase, the body gradually changes to a constitution that is prone to yo-yo effects.

And if these eating habits are maintained for a long time, it could lead to binge eating disorder.

It was popular for a while, but now it is a diet method that is hardly used anymore.

If you are eating this way, the amount of food you consume in one meal is large, but...

In reality, the amount that is digested and absorbed by the body is small.

For a thin person, there isn't much difference between eating little food and not eating much at all.

If you have a habit of eating a lot in one meal, it is better to divide your food into smaller portions.

I kept a food diary, and objectively speaking, the amount of food is quite large.

If you are not eating all your food in one meal but are properly dividing it up, then...

Actually, I eat a lot of food, but my absorption rate is low, so I have a body type that doesn't gain weight.

In this case, there are no issues with the digestive system.

By consistently exercising to build muscle and increase absorption, you can gain weight in a visually appealing and slim body.

Sounds plausible, right?
