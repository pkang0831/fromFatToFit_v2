How to reduce subcutaneous fat for someone with a lot of muscle and subcutaneous fat.

Hello, this is pkang.

In the past, a question about subcutaneous fat was posted in the comments, so I created a series of videos about subcutaneous fat.

In that video, there are overlapping functions between adipose tissue and muscle.

When muscle decreases, subcutaneous fat increases to take over the work of the muscle.

It was said that as muscle increases, the need for subcutaneous fat decreases, leading to a reduction in subcutaneous fat.

In the case of people who have actually lost weight by starving themselves or following a low-calorie diet,

Muscle loss occurs, leading to a decrease in muscle mass.

To compensate for the decrease in muscle function, the amount of subcutaneous fat can increase.

Muscle is heavier than fat.

When muscle decreases and fat increases, body weight can decrease.

Because of this, even though the weight is lean, having a lot of subcutaneous fat can lead to being classified as skinny fat.

Recently, the number of views for this video has increased, and there have been many comments asking questions about muscles and subcutaneous fat.

A question with this content was posted in the comments.

What are the circumstances in which a person has a lot of both subcutaneous fat and muscle?

For example, the body of a bodybuilder during the off-season or the body of a wrestler.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

As a reference, when discussing subcutaneous fat and muscle, there is always a comment that comes up.

If you do abdominal exercises to increase your abdominal muscle mass, will it help reduce belly fat?

If I do thigh exercises to increase thigh muscle mass, will I lose fat in my thighs? That's the question.

I previously made a response video about this question.

This is a video titled "[Is Spot Reduction Possible?]"

First of all, there is an interesting story regarding the fact that wrestling matches tend to have a lot of subcutaneous fat.

In 2019, ssireum became an issue on Korean YouTube.

A wrestling match video I uploaded a year ago suddenly became a hot topic and surpassed 1 million views.

While making the video this time, I found that it has currently surpassed 3 million views.

The reason the wrestling video suddenly became an issue is because of the bodies of the wrestlers featured in the video.

You can clearly see that they have a very good body with not much body fat.

This video was delivered to some female users through the YouTube algorithm, and

"I didn't realize only the old folks were watching this good thing."

"Oh, I didn't know, but I actually like wrestling."

This kind of joke quickly became a hot topic.

At that time, there were quite a few articles published.

At that time, it was actually trendy to go watch wrestling matches in person.

Some of the wrestling athletes have even formed fan clubs.

In the case of modern wrestlers, they do not have a lot of body fat or are not overweight.

However, the image of a wrestler in our minds is often associated with being overweight.

Why did this perception arise?

Past wrestling athletes artificially increased their weight.

The recent trend in wrestling is shifting towards technical wrestling.

Before that, weight wrestling was the trend.

In fact, if you look at past wrestling videos on YouTube, there is a lot of weight.

In wrestling, in order to throw your opponent, you need to disrupt their center of gravity.

Even if the skills are somewhat lacking, if the weight is heavy, the center of gravity is less likely to collapse.

Even if the center of gravity somewhat collapses, it was possible to win by pushing with body weight.

It was easier to gain weight than to train and teach difficult skills.

So, in order to forcefully gain weight, I eat a larger amount of food.

I also took a tonic that makes you gain weight.

So originally, I forced my body fat, which was not supposed to increase, to rise in order to gain weight.

In this process, a body was created that has a lot of muscle mass while also having a significant amount of subcutaneous fat.

And for athletes who have gained weight like this, the techniques have not been effective.

Technology is gradually disappearing, and only wrestling that relies solely on weight remains.

The enjoyment of watching wrestling has diminished, leading to a gradual decline in its popularity.

By choosing an easy way to win, you ended up missing out on the fun of watching.

As the popularity of wrestling continues to decline, the situation has become serious.

Within the wrestling community, voices of discontent have started to emerge.

There have been voices calling for a pursuit of technical wrestling rather than weight wrestling.

Thanks to that, the recent trend in wrestling is shifting towards a focus on technical wrestling.

So, artificially increasing weight has become much less common.

So, if you artificially increase body fat to gain weight,

Like past wrestling athletes, they can have a lot of muscle and a high amount of subcutaneous fat.

If you don't do that, it means that as muscle mass increases, subcutaneous fat decreases.

In the case of the second bodybuilder

In the case of bodybuilders, even during the off-season, they do not artificially increase their body fat.

So it's not that there is a lot of body fat.

But why do people think that bodybuilders have a lot of body fat during their off-season?

The simplest reason is that there is too much muscle mass, which makes the body look very large.

The body that bodybuilding aims for is not the level of fitness that we commonly think of.

The goal is to increase muscle mass to the limit.

The amount of muscle mass is significantly greater compared to an average person who exercises for 1 to 2 hours a day.

Because there is a lot of muscle mass, it can't help but be very large.

In competitions, subcutaneous fat is drastically reduced for muscle definition.

It appeared smaller than its original size.

After the competition ends, some body fat returns, making you look as big as you originally were.

Because it looks too big, it creates the misunderstanding that there is a lot of fat.

However, having a large body does not necessarily mean having a lot of body fat.

In reality, even during the off-season, there aren't many athletes who have flabby arms, thighs, or belly fat.

So, is it absolutely impossible for someone to have a lot of muscle and a lot of subcutaneous fat at the same time?

No, that's not the case.

I talked in detail about the process of gaining weight and the process of losing weight in the video.

In the case of severe obesity, it is possible to have a lot of muscle while also having a lot of subcutaneous fat.

I explained this part in detail in that video, so...

Those who are curious can refer to the video.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure the video on [the process of gaining weight and the process of losing weight] appears on the right.
