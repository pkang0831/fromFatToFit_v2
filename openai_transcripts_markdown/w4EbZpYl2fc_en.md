If you chew and spit out food that makes you gain weight while on a diet, what happens?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

Chewing food to taste it and then spitting it out without swallowing is called "chew and spit."

A question about using this chew-and-spit method for dieting was posted in the comments.

I made a video about chewing and spitting.

The content of the video can be divided into two main parts.

The first question is what logic is behind the idea that chewing and spitting can help with dieting.

And we talked about what errors there are in that logic.

The second topic discussed was the side effects of chewing and spitting.

However, when talking about side effects,

Since we are talking based on the situation of not eating food,

What about chewing and spitting while following a healthy diet?

There have been quite a few questions like this.

To put it simply, it is not good to chew and spit in any case.

Let's talk about why that is in detail.

First, I will briefly summarize the side effects of the chewing and spitting behavior that appeared in that video.

When we put food in our mouths and chew it, we experience the taste through our tongues.

Our body sends signals to prepare because food will soon be coming in.

A typical example is that stomach acid is secreted for digestion.

However, if you chew the food without swallowing it, just tasting it and then spitting it out,

There was a signal that food would be coming soon, but in reality, the food has not arrived.

This causes various problems to arise.

The first issue is a decrease in metabolic rate.

You chew the food to taste it, but since you spit it out without swallowing,

In reality, I didn't eat the food.

If you don't eat and starve, your body's metabolism decreases.

When the body's metabolism decreases, it becomes easier to gain weight.

The second problem is heartburn and acid reflux.

A signal will soon indicate that food is about to be served.

Due to that signal, stomach acid is secreted for digestion.

If you spit out the food without swallowing it, then there is actually no food that has entered.

When there is no food in the stomach, only stomach acid is present, which leads to heartburn and acid reflux.

The third problem is the confusion of the signaling system.

When you put food in your mouth and chew to taste it, the food then goes down.

According to this basic premise, the signals of the body are functioning.

The basic premise that has been chewed and spat out collapses, causing confusion in the signaling system.

The fourth problem is the increase in the time spent chewing and spitting.

In the initial stages of chewing, when the taste is sensed on the tongue, the signal that food is coming into the mouth is activated.

In reality, even if food doesn't come in, one can be led to believe that food has arrived.

So, even without chewing and spitting a lot, I feel satisfied.

However, if confusion arises in the signaling system,

If food doesn't actually enter the body, a feeling of fullness doesn't occur.

So the time spent chewing and spitting out gradually increases.

The side effects we just talked about seem to arise from not eating.

So it seems like eating food will solve it.

This is why questions arise about whether it's okay to chew and spit while following a diet plan.

The first issue, decreased saliva production, and the second issue, heartburn and acid reflux, are

Because the cause is not eating food.

Eating food can solve the problem.

However, the third issue of confusion in the signaling system and the fourth issue of increased time spent chewing and spitting out are

Eating food won't solve the problem.

Those two things are the cause of spitting it out.

Isn't the confusion in the signaling system and the prolonged chewing and spitting time due to not eating?

As I chew the food and taste it, my body thinks that the food will be coming in.

Confusion arises because I spit it out and don't actually eat the food.

That's why the time for chewing and spitting out is getting longer.

Don't just think of the food we eat as one single category.

You need to think of nutrients categorized as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

It is often said that vegetables that are large in volume and low in calories are good for dieting.

A typical example is cabbage.

Cabbage has a large volume but is low in calories, so

Even if you eat a lot, the calories are not high.

Therefore, filling your stomach with this cabbage is good for dieting.

However, this logic does not actually apply.

Just think simply.

Right now, I really want to eat chicken.

If you eat a lot of cabbage instead of chicken, does the desire to eat chicken go away?

Of course not.

When you want to eat chicken in the first place, you don't want to eat cabbage instead.

Even if I force myself to eat a lot of cabbage to fill my stomach, I still want to keep eating chicken.

Chicken and cabbage are completely different from the beginning, so they cannot be substituted for each other.

Therefore, the logic that filling your stomach with cabbage is sufficient does not hold.

Chicken is food, and cabbage is also food, but...

Why can't the desire to eat chicken be satisfied by eating cabbage?

It's because the composition of the nutrients is different.

In order for a person to live, various nutrients are needed.

Certain nutrients can cause serious health problems when they are deficient.

The human body has mechanisms that indicate a deficiency in nutrients.

Among the foods I know, I feel like eating foods that are rich in the nutrients I currently lack.

In order to actually follow a low-calorie diet, try limiting your fat intake.

You start to crave high-calorie, greasy foods.

If you follow a low-carbohydrate diet that severely restricts carbohydrate intake,

I feel like eating foods that are high in carbohydrates.

In that case, when you feel like eating greasy food because you're lacking fat,

Eating a lot of carbohydrate-rich foods is obviously not a solution.

This is something that obviously cannot be done.

What I needed in the first place is different from what I ate.

So, when you're on a diet and you start to crave other foods,

That is a signal indicating that something is lacking in your current diet.

When you go on a diet, the composition of your body will change.

Body fat decreases and muscle mass increases.

In this case, the nutrients needed by the body will naturally change as well.

If you ignore these signals from your body and continue to stick to the same diet,

The body requires essential nutrients.

Since it is not being fulfilled, stress continues to build up.

When this stress builds up to its limit and explodes,

You end up binge eating or giving up on your diet.

In the early stages of dieting, a person who was following their meal plan well...

On the brink of successful dieting.

The biggest reason people give up on sticking to their diet is because it's difficult.

So the desire to eat chicken...

It is a very important signal in dieting.

You need to check what nutrients are abundant in chicken but lacking in your diet and make changes to your diet accordingly.

However, if you chew and spit out the chicken in this situation and maintain the same diet,

If you can taste the chicken, the nutrients you want to get from it are not coming in.

Then the body will fall into confusion.

Filling your stomach with other foods without providing the necessary nutrients is

The stomach expands, which causes overeating.

The third problem of the chewing and spitting issue arises as confusion occurs in the signaling system.

The fourth problem is that the time spent chewing and spitting out is increasing.

It occurs in a form where the stomach expands and leads to overeating.

I will summarize the content so far in three simple points.

The first person needs various nutrients to live.

If there are lacking nutrients, I crave foods that can provide those nutrients.

If you crave chicken while following the second diet plan,

It signals that there are certain nutrients that are lacking in my current diet and that are abundant in chicken.

It is not necessary to eat chicken unconditionally, but...

This means that my body and the diet I am following do not match.

You need to change your diet.

In this situation, spitting out does not solve anything.

Rather, it only causes confusion in the signaling system or leads to overeating due to an increase in appetite.

This is how it will be.

Simply put, the act of chewing and spitting itself is the problem.

It means not to chew and spit in any situation.

So, the desire to eat food arises because the body needs nutrients, right?

So why do we want to eat so much food that it leads to obesity?

It's not like the body needs an excessive amount of nutrients to the point of obesity.

Yes, that's right.

The reason for wanting to eat so much food that it leads to obesity is due to false hunger.

So reducing that false hunger is the most fundamental aspect of dieting.

By reducing false hunger, you will only feel hungry when you truly need food.

The food you eat at times like this does not interfere with your diet.

You can diet while eating until you're full.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have a video about the principles of dieting and meal plans appear in the top left.

Why does false hunger occur?

If you are curious about how to follow a diet without false hunger,

You can click to see it.

But even if there are no issues with nutrients, can't you just want to eat chicken?

There are cases like that.

Even if there are no issues with nutrients, you may want to eat for psychological reasons.

In this case, you don't need to chew and spit; you can just eat the food.

In the first place, the desire to eat arises from psychological reasons.

Even a small amount is satisfying, but if I eat too much, I actually feel a sense of rejection.

Actually, it used to be a snack that I liked and ate often in the past.

After a long time of following the long-term diet, I finally ate something.

There are quite a few comments saying that it's too sweet and hard to eat.

Your taste changes.

There was a similar question about this in the past, so I made a detailed explanation video.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right.

If you're curious, you can click to see it.

In the middle of the video, it was mentioned that spitting out food can cause the stomach to expand.

Why does the stomach expand?

The human stomach is an elastic organ that can expand and contract.

Because it communicates signals with the brain, its size can change depending on appetite.

Simply put, even if you fill your stomach with cabbage, the desire to eat chicken will still remain.

To eat chicken, the stomach expands.

In fact, there was an experiment conducted on Korean TV broadcasts that filmed the expansion of the stomach.

I talked about this in detail in another video.

I will make sure to have a video about the increase in the upper part on the bottom left.

If you want to eat chicken while on a diet, you said that you need to make changes to your diet.

How should I make a change?

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a video explaining it.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
