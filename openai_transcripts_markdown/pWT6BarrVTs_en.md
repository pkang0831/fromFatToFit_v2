Hello, this is pkang.

This is the seventh video discussing intermittent fasting.

In Part 1 of the video, the basic principles are discussed.

In the second part of the video, we will discuss people who find it difficult to adhere to fasting times.

In Part 3 of the video, the reason why you should not binge eat even if you stick to your fasting hours is discussed.

In Part 4 of the video, we discuss why a 16-hour fast is not effective for everyone.

In the fifth video, we will discuss fasting duration and insulin.

In the sixth video, we explored the reasons why longer fasting periods are not necessarily better.

In this video, we will discuss what happens if you fast for 23 hours.

I would like to talk about the statement that it's okay to eat pizza and chicken.

Since the content of the video is all connected, it is easier to understand if you watch them in order starting from the first video.

For those who haven't seen the previous video, the playlist link is in the top right corner.

If you click, you can watch the videos in order starting from the one before.

In the sixth part of the video, as the fasting times gradually increase with intermittent fasting of 16:8, 20:4, and 23:1,

As meal times decrease, the amount of food consumed also decreases.

I mentioned that if the amount of food we eat decreases, problems with a low-calorie diet arise.

At the end of the video, this question came up.

I think it's an exaggeration to say that a long fasting period automatically means low calories.

With intermittent fasting, the longer the fasting period, the more calories you can consume.

With intermittent fasting, you can consume quite a bit of calories within an hour.

If you consume that many calories, it seems like it won't be a low-calorie diet.

And they say that with intermittent fasting 23:1, you can still lose weight even if you eat pizza or chicken.

Just looking at this, isn't it true that a longer fasting period leads to greater weight loss effects?

The answer to this question is connected to the content of Part 3 of the video.

When eating foods with the same calories in Part 3 of the video.

There was an experiment comparing the differences between intermittent fasting and not fasting.

In the case of high-calorie foods where the calories consumed in a day exceed the metabolic rate expended throughout the day,

In cases where intermittent fasting was not practiced, there was a significant increase in body fat.

In cases where intermittent fasting is practiced, body fat may slightly increase.

It was mentioned that there are cases where it actually decreases.

The reason for this result is said to be due to the processing capacity limit of the digestive system.

The human digestive system has a limit to the amount of food it can digest and absorb per hour.

If you eat more food than that limit capacity, it will not be properly digested or absorbed.

So, if you eat a large amount of food and do it all at once in a short period of time,

Body fat may not increase or may even decrease.

In the case of 23:1 intermittent fasting, there is only one hour available to eat.

No matter how much food you eat during this time, it will exceed the processing limits of your digestive system anyway.

In reality, the amount absorbed by the body is small, and this leads to issues with a low-calorie diet.

If that's true, then eating just one meal a day...

No matter what food you eat or how you eat it, it doesn't mean that you will definitely lose weight, right?

Yes, that's right.

In the past, there was a diet method called the "Noble One Meal Diet" that utilized this.

It was a diet method where you eat only one meal a day, regardless of what and how much food you consume.

The reason it is very popular is that you can eat whatever food you want without any restrictions.

Singer Hong Jin-young mentioned on the show "Radio Star" that she is currently following this diet.

I said that I eat only one meal a day, and I eat what I want until I feel like throwing up.

The MCs asked if I succeeded in my diet, and I mentioned that I saw results from it.

I often see comments asking, "Can you explain why mukbang streamers don't gain weight?"

The reason why mukbang streamers don't gain weight can also be explained by this.

In front of the camera, they clearly eat a huge amount of food.

The amount of food consumed exceeds the processing capacity of the digestive system.

It only digests and absorbs up to a limit, so it doesn't lead to weight gain.

If you practice 23-hour intermittent fasting,

You can eat more calories. "You can eat pizza and chicken too." This is also true.

It is possible because it exceeds the processing limits of such digestive organs.

The question is whether this type of eating is considered intermittent fasting.

As those who have seen Part 1 of the video know,

In the East, people primarily consume refined foods like rice, while in the West, they eat wheat flour as a staple.

Eating too much food too often due to false hunger has become a common part of our eating culture.

So what people generally think of as a normal portion size is actually eating too much food too often.

This causes the digestive system to be overworked.

Due to the rapid changes in blood sugar, there is confusion in the hormonal system.

Various diseases, including obesity, are occurring.

Take a fasting period without eating to give your digestive system a rest.

Let's normalize hormone secretion to keep the body healthy.

As a result, the process naturally leads to dieting.

This is the original purpose and essence of intermittent fasting.

However, refined foods like chicken or pizza can cause a rapid increase in blood sugar levels.

Disrupting hormone secretion

Eating more food than the limit in the digestive system within one hour is

It is an action that puts a very large burden on the digestive system.

How is this intermittent fasting?

This is completely deviating from the essence of intermittent fasting.

This is closer to a noble one-meal diet than intermittent fasting.

And the noble diet does lead to weight loss, but...

It was a diet method that quickly disappeared because its effects were temporary and there were many other health issues.

Because even though the amount of food consumed is large, it is not being digested or absorbed.

From the body's perspective, there isn't much difference between following a low-calorie diet and not.

So, the absorption rate increases and the metabolic rate decreases, resulting in the same hunger response.

If the amount of digestion and absorption increases due to hunger response, the effectiveness of the diet may decrease.

Alternatively, there were many cases where body fat actually increased.

Moreover, putting continuous strain on the digestive system itself is not good for health.

If such eating habits are maintained for a long time, there is a possibility of developing binge eating disorder.

It is a diet method that has now disappeared.

Of course, the noble 1 meal diet and the 23:1 intermittent fasting are not the same.

The noble 1 meal diet doesn't restrict the amount of food. It allows you to eat until you're full.

In the case of intermittent fasting, there is still a certain limit on the amount of food you can eat.

So these two things are not the same.

Intermittent fasting is not as harmful to health as the noble one-meal diet.

Still, the fundamental issue remains the same.

A person named Yoshinori has published a book and actively promoted the idea that eating once a day is beneficial.

I heard that a Nobel Prize was awarded recently for research related to autophagy, which helps cells become healthier and not age.

So I understand that if you eat once a day, autophagy is activated and you become healthier.

It's a bit hard to accept that intermittent fasting is not good for you.

In the next video, I will talk about one meal a day and autophagy.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure to have it appear on the right side.

If the video on the right is not the intermittent fasting part 8 video,

I am still in the process of making the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
