The topic of this video is whether meat is a carcinogenic food.

I have explained many reasons for needing to eat meat while talking about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

You left a question with the following content.

I have a question. When you stir-fry meat, it is cooked at a high temperature.

Carcinogenic heterocyclic amines are produced because of the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons.

I feel like there could be liver problems if I keep eating this. Is this a diet that can be maintained consistently?

To answer your question first,

It is true that carcinogenic substances are produced when meat is cooked at high temperatures.

So, if you ask whether that means we shouldn't eat meat, I don't think so.

I will talk about the reason for that.

I have a video I made in the past titled "Will there be problems due to a lack of carbohydrates on a low-carb, high-fat diet?"

What I talked about in this video is...

It is true that eating too few carbohydrates can lead to health issues.

However, I mentioned that it's important to know how many grams of carbohydrates are considered too little.

If you don't know how many grams this is and think that eating fewer carbohydrates is not good, then...

Even if you are eating a sufficient amount, you may not know if it is actually enough.

When it comes to a low-carb, high-fat diet, there are cases where people automatically oppose it.

It's a problem caused by errors in information.

So I compared the amount of carbohydrates that would not cause health issues with the amount of carbohydrates in the diet I mentioned.

It is true that heterocyclic amines are produced when meat is heated at high temperatures.

What temperature is considered high here? That's important.

What temperature are you referring to?

A temperature of 40 degrees is considered high based on the human body temperature.

When the body temperature exceeds 40 degrees, protein denaturation occurs, which is not good for health.

Since meat is a source of protein, does heating it above 40 degrees Celsius produce heterocyclic amines?

Or is 60 degrees, which is the temperature that causes burns, considered high temperature from this point?

Or the boiling point of water, which is 100 degrees?

Or the temperature for frying, which is 170 to 180 degrees?

It's a situation where we don't know the criteria.

There is a difference of over 100 degrees between 40 degrees and 170-180 degrees.

Depending on the criteria, 40 degrees can be considered high temperature, and 170 to 180 degrees can also be considered high temperature.

So, we need to know what temperature is being referred to in order to avoid any confusion.

Heterocyclic amines are said to have been discovered by a Japanese researcher in 1975.

It is said that it occurs when meat is heated at temperatures above 170 to 180 degrees.

It is said that when heated to temperatures above 200 to 250 degrees, the production amount increases threefold.

On the contrary, it is said that when heating below 100 degrees, the amount produced is almost negligible.

It is being generated, but the amount is so minimal that it can be ignored.

So, what temperature is the inside of the frying pan when we stir-fry meat?

There is a simple experiment to determine the internal temperature of a frying pan.

It's an experiment called a paper cup pot.

A paper cup will obviously catch fire if you set it on fire, since it is made of paper.

However, if you fill this paper cup with water and heat it, the paper cup won't burn while the water boils.

When heat is applied from the outside, the temperature of the paper cup rises and it begins to burn.

When there is water in a paper cup, the heat is continuously absorbed by the water, preventing the paper cup from getting hot and burning.

Water has a boiling point of around 100 degrees, so it cannot exceed 100 degrees before it all boils away.

The same goes for the frying pan.

When following a low-carb, high-fat diet, it's often recommended to stir-fry meat and vegetables.

Meat contains moisture known as juice.

Vegetables also contain moisture.

The internal temperature of the frying pan will remain around 100 degrees until all the moisture inside evaporates.

As mentioned earlier, carcinogens are hardly produced around 100 degrees.

Even if it is produced in very small amounts, eating vegetables can inhibit the body's absorption.

If you consume a sufficient amount of vegetables on a low-carb, high-fat diet, then heterocyclic amines are not a problem.

In the next video, I will talk about the second carcinogen mentioned in the questions, which is aromatic hydrocarbons.
