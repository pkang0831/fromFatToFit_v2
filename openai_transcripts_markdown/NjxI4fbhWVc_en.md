Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video about lower body obesity, created in response to a question that was posted in the comments.

In the first part of the video, we talked about lower body obesity in people who weigh a lot.

The link to the front playlist is at the top right, so if you haven't watched Part 1, you can go and watch it.

One of the reasons for lower body obesity mentioned in Part 1 of the video is

I mentioned that the lower body muscles have developed excessively due to heavy weight.

There are times when I think I shouldn't exercise because I'm worried that it will make my lower body obesity worse.

In reality, it is not like that.

Because the cause of lower body obesity is not just related to weight and muscle alone.

There are actually people who have a normal weight but are obese in the lower body.

In the case of such individuals, lower body obesity often occurs due to their posture.

One of the most commonly seen poor postures among modern people is the forward head posture, also known as "turtle neck" posture.

When you lean your head forward to look at a book, smartphone, or computer,

Because my head feels heavy, my balance is off.

To maintain this balance, the lower part will move in the opposite direction.

So when the head tilts forward, the back and chest lean back.

When the back and chest lean back, the lower abdomen will protrude forward.

When the lower abdomen protrudes forward, the hips move back.

When the buttocks stick out, the muscles in the front part of the thighs are used excessively.

This posture causes problems in several areas.

Since we are talking about lower body obesity, let's focus on the aspects related to lower body obesity.

When the lower abdomen protrudes, the abdominal muscles relax.

If the abdominal muscles remain relaxed for an extended period, they will gradually shrink as they are not being used.

If the abdominal muscles decrease, the subcutaneous fat in the abdomen will increase, leading to an increase in belly fat.

When the lower abdomen protrudes, it feels like the strength of the abdominal muscles is released.

When the buttocks stick out, the muscles of the buttocks, the gluteal muscles, become relaxed.

As the strength of the glute muscles relaxes, the glute muscles also gradually shrink.

If the glute muscles shrink, the subcutaneous fat in the buttocks will increase.

There is no glute muscle to push the subcutaneous fat on the buttocks back, so it cannot lift the hips.

Due to gravity, it sags, and this results in having a lot of flesh on the buttocks, but a flat butt.

The muscles in the front of the thigh are constantly used, so they gradually develop.

As the muscles develop, the subcutaneous fat in that area decreases.

The subcutaneous fat on the sides and back of the thighs remains the same, so the thickness of the thighs does not decrease.

The muscles in the front of the thigh become developed, resulting in a protruding shape.

When you combine all of this, it leads to lower body obesity.

So even if your weight is normal, you can still have lower body obesity.

To solve this problem, exercises are needed to create the correct posture.

Which area should I exercise?

It's not just a problem in one area; it's an issue with the whole body, so full-body exercise is necessary.

Do shoulder exercises to pull your rounded shoulders back and straighten them.

You need to do chest exercises to build your chest muscles so that the pulling strength and balance of your back muscles are aligned.

To strengthen weakened abdominal and glute muscles, you should also do abdominal and glute exercises.

In that case, you obviously need to do core exercises as well.

And lower body obesity caused by posture issues can occur regardless of weight.

Obese individuals with a heavy weight can also experience the same symptoms.

So, even people who are heavier, as mentioned in Part 1, need to exercise.

If you lose weight without exercising, the issue of weight and muscle is resolved, but...

Posture issues can lead to lower body obesity.

But if you exercise, your muscles develop, so doesn't that mean you can't lose weight?

And it's said that the muscles in the front of the thighs are excessively developed due to posture-related issues causing lower body obesity.

Since I need to reduce the muscles in the front of my thighs, does that mean I shouldn't do thigh exercises?

That's not the case.

The muscles in the front of the thigh that develop under continuous strain due to poor posture.

Muscle growth that develops under continuous load with heavy weight is

Although the causes of posture and weight are different, the fact that they both develop under continuous load is the same.

However, just because you exercise doesn't mean that those muscles won't disappear.

In the next video, we will discuss the reasons why muscle mass can decrease even when exercising.

I will talk about having thick calves and lower body obesity.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the third part of the lower body obesity series, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
