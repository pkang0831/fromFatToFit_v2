Hello, this is pkang.

The topic of this video is a low-carb, high-fat diet.

If you look for information about a low-carb, high-fat diet,

Some people claim that a healthy diet is beneficial for health and provide evidence to support that.

Some people claim that a certain diet is unhealthy and provide evidence to support that it is indeed not good for health.

It's confusing to know whose words are correct because they are saying opposing things.

Why does this confusion arise?

Many people think that a low-carb, high-fat diet refers to a specific single diet.

However, in reality, there isn't just one type of low-carb, high-fat diet.

A low-carb, high-fat diet refers to a diet in which the calories obtained from fat are higher than those obtained from carbohydrates.

Any diet that meets this condition falls under a low-carb, high-fat diet.

So there is a very broad concept called a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Inside, there are various types of diets.

So a diet that includes 10g of carbohydrates and 100g of fat is also a low-carb, high-fat diet.

A diet that includes 100g of carbohydrates and 50g of fat is also considered a low-carb, high-fat diet.

100g of carbohydrates and 50g of fat means there are more carbohydrates, right?

A low-carb, high-fat diet is one where the calories obtained from fat are higher than those obtained from carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates provide 4 kcal per gram, while fats provide 9 kcal per gram.

100g of carbohydrates is 400 kcal, and 50g of fat is 450 kcal.

Since the fat at 450 kcal is higher than the carbohydrates at 400 kcal, it is a low-carb, high-fat diet.

You say you're on a low-carb, high-fat diet, but you're eating 100g of carbohydrates?

Isn't a low-carb, high-fat diet one that puts the body into a state of ketosis?

To achieve a state of ketosis, carbohydrates should be limited to under 30g.

The requirement to put the body into ketosis is a condition of the ketogenic diet.

It is true that there is a ketogenic diet among low-carb, high-fat diets, but...

As mentioned earlier, there are various diets within the low-carb, high-fat diet.

Just because a low-carb, high-fat diet does not meet the conditions of a ketogenic diet, it cannot be said that it is not a low-carb, high-fat diet.

To make it easier to understand, you can think of it in terms of a country and a city.

In the country of Korea, there is a city called Seoul and a city called Busan.

Seoul is in Korea, and Busan is also in Korea. However, Seoul and Busan are different cities.

Just because it is not exactly like Seoul, we cannot say that Busan is not a part of Korea.

Just because the ketogenic diet and the conditions are not exactly the same...

You can't say that a diet that meets the basic conditions of a low-carb, high-fat diet is not a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In Korea, the three well-known low-carb, high-fat diets are the ketogenic diet, Atkins diet, and Paleo diet.

These three diets are all low-carb, high-fat diets.

When you search for low-carb high-fat diets, information about three different types of diets gets mixed together.

These three diets are all different from each other.

Let me explain how each diet is different.

The Atkins diet is a diet that initially restricts carbohydrates and then gradually increases the amount consumed.

During the first week of starting the diet, I limit my daily carbohydrate intake to less than 10g.

It's a lifestyle where you hardly eat carbohydrates.

In this case, a lack of carbohydrates can lead to various side effects such as headaches, lethargy, and skin rashes.

After intentionally inducing this state,

Starting from the second week, gradually increase the intake of carbohydrates to structure the diet.

As the intake of carbohydrates increases, the side effects caused by a lack of carbohydrates will gradually decrease.

As you gradually increase carbohydrates, there comes a point where the symptoms of carbohydrate deficiency disappear.

The purpose of the diet is to find the carbohydrate intake at that point.

The reason for doing this is...

It has been reported that the cause of obesity is excessive carbohydrate intake.

In that case, eating fewer carbohydrates can help with dieting.

However, if you eat too few carbohydrates, it can cause side effects in your body.

We are trying to find the minimum intake amount that does not cause side effects in the body.

However, since each person has different body fat, muscle mass, activity level, and exercise amount, the required amount of carbohydrates varies.

So it is erroneous to tell everyone to eat a specific amount uniformly.

Finding the minimum carbohydrate intake that does not cause side effects in my body.

It's a diet that aims to eat just that much.

The second paleo diet has no restrictions on carbohydrate intake.

It is a diet that restricts the types of foods you can eat.

Modern humanity primarily consumes grains as a staple food, but

This is possible only because large-scale cultivation has been made feasible through artificial intervention in agriculture.

In the era before agriculture, the main food sources were meat obtained from hunting and vegetables and fruits gathered from the wild.

Since humans are eating foods that they originally did not consume, various health problems are arising.

It's a diet that encourages returning to the foods that humanity originally ate.

Recently, there are many opinions suggesting that the causes of obesity lie in grains such as rice and wheat.

The majority of modern people have lactose intolerance, which means they cannot digest milk.

There are many discussions about how processed foods can negatively affect health.

So, don't eat these kinds of foods; instead, eat the meat, vegetables, and fruits that humanity originally consumed.

The meat consumed at this time is not from animals that were fed with feed and raised in confinement.

Originally, the meat is fed what it used to eat and raised by free-range grazing.

The diet is to eat vegetables and fruits organically.

And it's not about doing this diet temporarily, but rather maintaining it for a lifetime.

Because eating unhealthy food can lead to a decline in health again.

It means we shouldn't eat that kind of food.

So, rather than a diet plan, it can be seen as a meal plan that changes your lifestyle.

It is sometimes called a primal diet because it is eaten like a caveman.

It is a diet that is sometimes called the Paleolithic diet because it is eaten like in the Paleolithic era.

The third ketogenic diet is a diet that intentionally induces symptoms of carbohydrate deficiency.

It's somewhat similar to the Atkins diet.

The Atkins diet induces symptoms of carbohydrate deficiency, and if you find the point at which those symptoms disappear,

The purpose of the ketogenic diet is to maintain a state of carbohydrate deficiency.

Some organs in the human body use only carbohydrates as energy under normal circumstances.

A typical example is the brain.

In the case of the brain, it uses glucose made from carbohydrates as energy.

When the body lacks carbohydrates, there is no glucose for the brain to use.

In this case, the body starts to extract and use substitutes for glucose from fats and proteins.

During this process, a byproduct called ketone is produced.

The state in which ketones are produced in the body is referred to as ketosis.

The goal of the ketogenic diet is to maintain this state of ketosis.

That's why it's sometimes called a ketogenic diet and sometimes referred to as a ketosis diet.

Earlier, when we were talking about the Atkins diet, you mentioned that a lack of carbohydrates can lead to side effects, right?

But why intentionally reduce carbohydrates?

In general situations, to organs that use carbohydrates as energy.

It is to force the use of body fat.

If an organ that originally did not use body fat starts using body fat as energy,

This is because I believe that body fat will decrease more quickly.

There are side effects, but this diet takes those side effects into account.

It is a diet that is only for a short period of time to prevent side effects from becoming too severe.

In summary, the ketogenic diet is a diet that intentionally induces symptoms of carbohydrate deficiency in the body.

The Atkins diet is a plan that seeks to find the minimum amount of carbohydrate intake needed to avoid symptoms of carbohydrate deficiency.

Paleo is a diet that does not have any restrictions on carbohydrate intake.

These three diets are completely different.

However, all three correspond to a low-carb, high-fat diet.

And the low-carb, high-fat diet is not limited to just these three meal plans.

There are really, really many meal plans that have additional conditions while meeting the basic requirements.

There are an incredibly large number of types.

So if you are interested in a low-carb, high-fat diet,

You should know that there are various types of low-carb, high-fat diets, rather than just one.

You need to distinguish between each diet.

If not distinguished, there are quite a few cases where two different diets are combined to create a strange hybrid diet.

And it can cause various health problems.

In the following video, we will discuss a hybrid diet that combines two different meal plans.

There are currently two videos on the screen, and I will make sure that the next video appears on the right once it is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the low-carb, high-fat diet video, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making it.
