Hello, this is pkang.

This is the sixth video discussing intermittent fasting.

In Part 1 of the video, the basic principles of intermittent fasting are discussed.

In the second part of the video, the reason why some people struggle to adhere to fasting times.

In the third part of the video, the error in the claim that it is okay to binge eat as long as you adhere to fasting times.

In Part 4 of the video, the reason why a 16-hour fasting period is not effective for everyone is discussed.

In the fifth video, we talked about intermittent fasting and insulin.

In this video, we will explore whether having a longer fasting period is more effective.

Since the content of the video is all connected, it is better to watch them in order starting from the previous video.

For those who haven't seen the previous video, the playlist link is available in the top right corner.

It is recommended to click and watch the first part of the video in order.

In the fifth part of the video, the amount of food consumed affects the secretion of insulin.

If the amount of insulin secreted is different, the effects on the body will also be different.

Without an understanding of this aspect,

When you eat food, insulin is released, and when insulin is released, dieting becomes ineffective.

If you think this simply, you will fall into error.

The first error that appeared in the fifth video is the belief that if there is no fasting period, dieting won't work.

I believe that the longer the fasting period, the more effective it is for dieting.

Recently, it's not about the 16:8 intermittent fasting.

I've been seeing more and more comments about intermittent fasting, specifically the 18:6 and 20:4 methods.

However, an extended fasting period means that the meal time is reduced in contrast.

If meal times are reduced, the amount of food consumed decreases.

If the amount of food you eat decreases, it becomes a problem of turning into a low-calorie diet.

A low-calorie diet is one where the total calorie intake is low.

I understand that it refers to eating food without having a fasting period.

Intermittent fasting, such as 18:6 or 20:4, is said to be different from a low-calorie diet because it involves having fasting periods.

I need 1.5 million won for living expenses each month, but if I only receive 1 million won, I will be short on my living expenses.

The problem here is that the amount of money received is 1 million won.

It's not a matter of whether to give this 1 million won all at once or to divide it into five payments of 200,000 won each.

Even if I receive 1 million won all at once, it's still not enough for living expenses, and even if I receive it in five installments of 200,000 won each, it's still not enough for living expenses.

Similarly, if the total calorie intake is less than the calories needed by the body,

Just because there are fasting periods doesn't mean that it can't be a low-calorie diet. It is a low-calorie diet in itself.

The biggest problem with a low-calorie diet is that it triggers a hunger response in the body.

Just because you have fasting periods doesn't mean that the hunger response won't occur.

Isn't the so-called "hunger response" a condition where the basal metabolic rate decreases, making it easier to gain weight back?

There is research that shows the basal metabolic rate increases after a 48-hour fast.

What is the basis for saying that the starvation response occurs when the basal metabolic rate increases?

When fasting for 48 hours after consuming a sufficient amount of food,

There are cases where the basal metabolic rate temporarily increases.

Because of this, I ate a lot of food, and then I started fasting.

On the contrary, I feel better and have a lot of energy. There are reviews like this.

However, this is a reaction that occurs when one has been eating sufficient food and then undergoes a 48-hour fast.

Having a fasting period while following a low-calorie diet does not produce the same reactions.

Basal metabolic rate refers to the energy expenditure of the body at rest, similar to the functions of the heart, lungs, and brain.

It refers to the energy consumed by an institution that operates 24 hours a day without a moment of rest.

The reason why basal metabolic rate decreases when following a low-calorie diet is that the body adapts to the reduced energy intake by slowing down its metabolism to conserve energy.

If the heart, lungs, and brain lack energy and cannot function properly, they will cease to operate, leading to death.

When the amount of food consumed decreases

It is a response that aims to reduce energy consumption by lowering the functions of the heart, lungs, and brain.

So, if you think about smartphones, it becomes easy to understand.

When our smartphone battery is low, we dim the screen brightness, right?

By dimming the screen, energy consumption decreases, allowing you to use the device a bit longer with less battery.

In a situation where the food is low in calories, in order to survive a little longer.

There is a survival response that lowers the basal metabolic rate.

However, it is difficult to say that this survival response disappears just because there is a fasting period.

If I had a fasting period in a low-calorie situation, my basal metabolic rate did not decrease.

In this case, humanity would not have been able to survive from hunger.

We live in an environment where it is easy to obtain food now, but...

In the past, our ancestors likely lived in environments where it was difficult to find food.

In that case, since the amount of food consumed is small, the body lowers its metabolism accordingly.

I was trying to survive somehow, but if there is no response like this...

In an environment where it is difficult to obtain food, the body's metabolism doesn't decrease, which can lead to starvation and death.

But this doesn't make sense.

I will summarize.

If you extend the fasting period, it means that the meal time is reduced accordingly.

When meal times are reduced, the total amount of food consumed decreases.

When the total amount of food consumed decreases, the calorie intake also decreases.

When the calorie intake decreases, there is an issue of it becoming a low-calorie diet.

When following a low-calorie diet, the body's metabolic rate decreases, and a hunger response occurs, leading to an increased absorption rate of food.

In this case, the effects of the diet will gradually diminish, and at the same time, it will make your body more prone to rebound weight gain.

Usually, after this happens, when you eat food without adhering to the fasting time,

Seeing the body fat rapidly increase

I sometimes think that it's because I didn't stick to my fasting schedule.

It's not because I didn't stick to the fasting hours.

The fasting period was too long, resulting in a low-calorie diet.

This is because it triggered a hunger response in the body. The causal relationship is somewhat altered.

As mentioned in Part 1 of the video, intermittent fasting refers to...

Due to a diet that primarily consists of processed foods, we tend to eat too much of the food we usually consume.

Let's reduce this to an appropriate level.

To do that, let's eat intermittently. It means to intentionally have fasting periods.

It's not that food is better the less you eat, or that longer fasting periods are necessarily better.

It seems like a leap to say that a longer fasting period automatically means low calories.

In intermittent fasting, the longer the fasting period, the more the amount of calories you can consume increases.

With intermittent fasting, you can consume quite a bit of calories within an hour.

If you consume that many calories, it seems like it won't be a low-calorie diet.

And they say that with 23:1 intermittent fasting, you can still lose weight even if you eat chicken or pizza.

Just looking at this, isn't it true that a longer fasting period leads to a greater weight loss effect?

In the next video, I will talk about this question.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right side of the screen.

If the video on the right is not the intermittent fasting part 7 video,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
