Does eating a lot of carbohydrates make you gain weight? Then what about this photo?

Hello, this is pkang.

There was a question in the comments asking what I think about a certain video.

I had looked at that video.

It was a video about how eating rice does not necessarily lead to obesity.

Recently, it has been reported that consuming a lot of carbohydrates is a cause of obesity.

There is a growing awareness that we need to reduce the consumption of staple grains like rice.

It's a video that talks about how that's not the case.

I think the part that the person asking the question is most curious about is the story behind this photo.

It's one of the photos that appears in the video.

This is a photo that shows that our ancestors ate a lot of rice but were still slim.

So in this video, I would like to talk about this photo.

There are four main reasons why I don't become obese even after eating a large amount of rice like in that photo.

The first reason is due to differences in breed improvement.

Many people think of the rice our ancestors ate in the past as the same as modern rice.

The differences due to breeding improvements are significant.

Originally, wild rice does not have a large amount of starch storage, nor does it produce a large quantity of grains.

However, in order to cultivate as much rice as possible in the same area,

The modern rice plant has increased the storage of starch and the quantity of rice grains.

Is the difference due to breeding really that significant?

A representative example that illustrates that difference is the Mudeungsan watermelon.

Mudeungsan watermelon is a type of watermelon that is grown in Mudeungsan.

In the past, it was a watermelon known for its good taste, which was sometimes sent as a tribute to the palace.

The watermelons we commonly eat are grown from improved seed varieties, but

This Mudeungsan watermelon is characterized by preserving the original variety from the past.

It is called the watermelon that the king used to eat, which makes it much more expensive than regular watermelons.

However, when you actually eat the Mudeungsan watermelon, it has the characteristic of being less flavorful.

The flesh is not firm, so it breaks easily.

Because there is a lot of water, the sweetness is weak, and there are a lot of seeds.

If it was good enough to be presented to the palace, it must have been the best quality watermelon in the past.

In modern times, where breeding has become commonplace, it is said that the quality has significantly declined.

Rice also has these differences, so the rice of the past cannot be the same as modern rice.

The second difference is in the method of peeling the skin.

Modern white rice is consumed after being processed multiple times by machines, resulting in the complete removal of the husk.

In the past, there were no milling machines, and milling technology had not developed.

So we ate rice that was less polished.

I ate rice that still had some husk on it, and this is exactly what brown rice is.

Even though they are the same rice, white rice is classified as a fattening food, while brown rice is classified as a weight-loss food.

The reason for this difference is due to the shell.

If the shell is protecting the contents, you can only obtain the contents after completely melting the shell.

The dietary fiber and phytic acid in the skin interfere with digestion and absorption.

Brown rice is absorbed by the body in much smaller amounts than white rice, and it raises blood sugar levels at a slower rate.

That's why it's said to be good food for dieting.

So when we think of rice today, we picture white rice.

The rice that our ancestors used to eat was primarily brown rice.

It is likely that even that is less processed than modern brown rice.

The third difference is the level of activity.

In modern times, there are household appliances that assist with chores.

There is a car that helps you travel long distances.

There are escalators and elevators that help you go up to higher places.

However, in the past, there were no such machines at all.

Everyone had to move their bodies themselves.

As a result, the energy expended through physical activity was much greater compared to modern times.

So, even if the same amount of food is consumed, the likelihood of being slimmer in the past compared to modern times is higher.

The last fourth point is that the grain shown in that photo is likely not rice.

When many people think of farming, they primarily think of rice farming.

Rice farming requires a very large amount of water.

Right now, there is a massive dam that collects water.

There is a machine that brings water needed for agriculture.

Bringing in the water needed for rice farming is not a particularly big task, but...

In the past, there were neither dams nor machines.

Bringing water needed for rice farming was a very difficult task.

Moreover, in the case of Korea, more than half of the land is mountainous, which makes it even more difficult.

So, except for some major agricultural areas, most farming was done in fields.

The rice paddy for farming has received a very high valuation.

The grains cultivated in the fields were mainly referred to as coarse grains, such as millet, sorghum, and barley.

In the past, the staple food of our ancestors was this kind of mixed grain.

In the beginning, white rice with meat soup was a precious dish that was only eaten in wealthy noble families.

And these grains are foods with lower nutritional density compared to white rice.

Simply put, it's a food that is less likely to make you gain weight compared to white rice.

To summarize,

In the past, irrigating the fields was a very difficult task.

Except for some areas known as granaries, most farming was done in fields.

It wasn't easy to transport the produced rice because there were no roads and cars like today.

Rice itself was very precious.

So the staple foods that our ancestors ate were grains like barley, millet, and sorghum.

Considering this, the grains in the bowl in the photo...

It is highly likely that not everything is rice.

Even if everything is rice.

Because it has not been improved through breeding, it has a lower nutritional density than modern rice.

Because the milling technology has not developed, proper digestion and absorption do not occur.

I was very active, so I burned off everything I ate, which is why I was slim.

However, through breeding, the nutritional density is high and

With the development of milling technology, we can now consume white rice with the husk completely removed.

It is hard to say that we won't gain weight if we eat the same amount while having low levels of physical activity.

Simply put, the past and the present are different.
