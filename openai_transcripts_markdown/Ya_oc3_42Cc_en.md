The reason my friend, who keeps eating fattening snacks, is slim (the speed at which they eat).

Hello, this is pkang.

The video made just before this one is about the number of times to chew food.

In that video, it was mentioned that the type of food is more important than the number of times you chew it.

However, if you chew your food a lot, you will eat more slowly.

There is a saying that eating food slowly is good for dieting.

The question of what you think about this came up at the end of the video.

So in this video, I would like to talk about the speed at which we eat food.

I have a friend who seems to eat snacks every day but is still slim.

If you were curious about why that friend is slim, the content of this video can provide the answer.

The reason why it is said that eating food slowly is good for dieting is that...

It is due to the time lag in feeling full.

When a person needs food, they feel hunger, and when they eat enough food, they experience fullness.

However, it takes a certain amount of time for this feeling of fullness to be sensed.

So just because you've eaten enough food doesn't mean you immediately feel full.

It takes some time.

If you eat slowly, you will feel full before eating a lot of food, which will make you stop eating.

If you eat food too quickly,

It means that you end up eating a lot of food before you even feel full.

Overeating, which is consuming more food than necessary, is one of the causes of obesity.

Eating food quickly can lead to obesity. Eating slowly is good for dieting.

Such stories come up.

There is an experiment that was actually conducted.

We prepared it in a buffet style so that you can eat as much food as you want.

One side is crowded with people, noisy, and has fast music playing, where meals are served.

On the other side, there were no people, it was quiet, and when I had a meal in an environment where slow music was playing,

People who have eaten in a noisy environment

I ate quickly and had more than an average of four plates of food.

People who have meals in a quiet environment

I ate slowly and consumed an average of less than three plates of food.

So if you eat food quickly, you need to eat more food to feel full.

Eating food slowly allows you to consume relatively less food while still feeling full.

So, if you chew your food a lot and eat slowly, is it true that it's good for dieting?

Eating slowly is indeed good for dieting, but...

You don't have to chew it a lot for that.

As I mentioned in the video about the number of times to chew the food I made earlier,

Intentionally chewing food a lot is not necessarily good for dieting.

And to eat slowly, it’s not necessary to chew a lot.

In the experiment mentioned earlier, the speed of eating was manipulated.

I did not include conditions like "chew a lot" or "chew a little."

The atmosphere of the dining environment and the music changed the pace of the meal.

If you actually observe someone who eats slowly,

It's not that the number of times you chew is high, but rather that the speed of chewing itself is often slow.

Because the chewing speed is slow, it gives the impression that one is chewing thoroughly.

In addition, the amount of food that can be put in the mouth at one time is small or

There is often a long interval between swallowing food and putting the next food in the mouth.

On the contrary, people who eat quickly often have a naturally fast chewing speed.

Because they chew and eat food quickly, there is no impression that they chew thoroughly.

In addition, the amount of food that is put in the mouth at one time is large or

In most cases, the interval between swallowing food and putting the next food in the mouth is short.

To summarize,

Eating food slowly is good for dieting, and if you chew your food well, you will eat it slowly.

Because of this story, slow eaters will chew their food more.

Alternatively, a person who chews their food a lot will eat slowly.

There are many cases where people tend to connect these two things without fail.

In fact, chewing food thoroughly and eating slowly are two different things.

In a situation where the overall meal pace is fast, trying to just increase the number of chews doesn't really work well.

Rather than forcibly holding onto food that has already been chewed and is about to go down the throat,

The overall message is that slowing down the pace of meals is much more effective.

My colleague constantly eats snacks while working. There are always snacks in the desk drawer.

It's really amazing that I'm not gaining weight. Is it because I'm eating snacks slowly?

Yes, it is possible.

A person who often eats and enjoys snacks but doesn't gain weight, in the eyes of those around them.

I do eat snacks, but I often eat them very slowly.

A typical person breaks a snack that can be eaten in one bite into two or three pieces before eating it.

I chew and swallow the snacks I eat very slowly.

After eating one piece, you put the next piece in your mouth after a while.

Because I eat very slowly over a long period of time, it seems to others that I am eating snacks every time they see me.

So you might think that you eat a lot of snacks, but in reality, the amount you eat isn't that much.

Snacks are high in calories, so even a small amount can provide a lot of calories.

When you consume a lot of calories, it naturally leads to a feeling of fullness.

If you feel full and stop eating snacks, putting the remaining snacks in the desk drawer, then...

There will always be snacks in the desk drawer.

On the contrary, people who gain weight from eating snacks tend to eat them quickly and not leave any behind.

Ironically,

Because I eat quickly, the time spent eating is short, so others can't see it well.

There are often no snacks in the desk drawer because I don't leave any behind.

So it doesn't seem like I eat snacks often, and I don't always have snacks on hand either.

In reality, the amount of snacks consumed is large, which leads to weight gain.

Lastly, one thing to be cautious about is

Eating slowly to feel full and stopping the meal at that moment is effective for dieting.

The reason why it is said that eating slowly is good for dieting in the first place is that...

It's to feel full before overeating so that I can stop eating.

If you feel full but continue to eat without stopping, it leads to overeating.

Overeating is obviously not good for dieting.
