It's fine to maintain a fasting state without eating or to eat very simply.

If you have a proper meal like an ordinary office worker's lunch,

After a meal, I always have a craving for sweet foods like chocolate.

Even though I'm full, I find myself craving something sweet.

There are times when I crave something like chocolate so much that I can't stand it.

Why is this happening?

A question with this content was posted in the comments.

The desire to eat sweets after a meal is one of the causes of obesity.

If I can just manage that desire well, I can go on a diet.

Why do we crave sweet foods after a meal?

And let's talk about how to solve it.

Among the food we ate, the carbohydrates are

When it enters the body, it is converted into glucose and moves through the blood.

The concentration of glucose in this blood is called blood sugar.

When you consume carbohydrates, the amount of glucose in the blood increases, which is referred to as high blood sugar.

If we consider blood sugar levels to have three states: -1, 0, and +1,

-1 indicates a low blood sugar level, and at this time, you need to eat food to raise your blood sugar.

The glucose in the blood is used as energy for the brain and muscles.

If you eat food, it will raise your blood sugar levels.

The brain becomes happy, and the muscles gain strength.

When you're feeling down because of this, eating sweet foods can lift your spirits.

They say you should definitely eat carbohydrates if you want to do exercises that use a lot of muscles.

However, among the foods we eat,

There are foods that raise blood sugar not just to 0, but all the way up to +1.

It raises blood sugar too much.

This is a problem.

When blood sugar increases by +1,

The brain becomes happier, and the muscles gain more strength.

However, if high blood sugar levels are maintained, inflammation occurs in the blood vessel walls.

Our body secretes a hormone called insulin to lower blood sugar levels.

So, our body raises blood sugar when it is too low.

If blood sugar is too high, it can be lowered in various ways.

It means that you are trying to maintain a stable blood sugar level.

When the blood sugar level, which had risen to +1, drops to 0,

The absolute level of blood sugar is not low; it has reached an appropriate state.

However, compared to +1, 0 is lower.

Because of this drop, my brain feels unhappier now than when my blood sugar was at +1.

So, I want to eat sweet foods again to raise my blood sugar by +1.

However, if you eat sweet foods and raise your blood sugar by +1,

Insulin hormone is released again, lowering blood sugar to zero.

I also crave sweet foods again.

It's a cycle of repetition.

This is why there are addiction symptoms associated with sugary foods like sugar.

It is said that we should be careful of sugar addiction.

So, if blood sugar rises too quickly and too much, it becomes a problem.

Let's remember what we've discussed so far and think about the question that was posed at the beginning of the video.

If you completely refrain from eating or have very simple meals,

You said you didn't want to eat sweet food.

Fasting without eating food does not raise blood sugar levels in the first place.

If you have a simple meal

Since the amount of carbohydrates consumed is low, blood sugar does not rise significantly.

Since blood sugar doesn't rise too high, there are no issues caused by fluctuations in blood sugar levels.

Therefore, there is no symptom of wanting to eat sweet foods.

However, if a regular office worker has a proper meal for lunch,

It has been said that there is a strong desire to eat sweet foods like chocolate after a meal.

In other words, a proper meal like a typical office worker's lunch raises blood sugar levels too much.

The issue is that the foods we thought were ordinary and commonly consumed have problems.

This is why the global population of obese individuals continues to rise.

So to summarize,

A person who has eaten foods that cause their blood sugar to rise too quickly and significantly.

Even if you eat enough to feel full,

After a meal, there is a desire to eat something sweet.

This is one of the causes of obesity.

There are three main ways to solve this problem.

The first is to change the types of food you eat.

The processed foods that we commonly eat in our daily lives are

During the processing, the nutritional density increases, and it is modified to allow for faster digestion and absorption.

The higher the nutritional density, the more blood sugar rises when consuming the same amount.

The faster digestion and absorption occur, the quicker blood sugar levels rise.

By reducing the intake of processed foods, we can address the root cause of the problem.

The second is to slow down digestion and absorption.

We need to reduce processed foods. Almost everyone knows this.

However, there are not many people who actually practice this.

There are already so many processed foods around us.

When eating food, consuming vinegar or dietary fiber together can...

Vinegar and dietary fiber interfere with digestion and absorption.

It can help to lower blood sugar levels.

The last third is using glucose in the blood as energy.

Although it is said to be used for energy, it doesn't have to accomplish anything extraordinary.

You can walk for about 10 minutes after eating.

By doing this, the glucose that should raise blood sugar is used as energy.

It is possible to prevent blood sugar from rising too high.

Just doing this can be quite helpful for your diet.

In reality, after each of the three meals a day, for 10 minutes.

There is also an experiment that shows walking for 30 minutes after each meal resulted in a weight loss of 3 kg in a month.

There are various methods available.

You can choose the method that you can do and go ahead with it.

You said that processed food is the problem, so I should change the types of food I eat.

What exactly do I need to change and how should I do it?

Regarding how to change the types of food you eat,

I used to make related videos in the past.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

Q. You mentioned that consuming vinegar and dietary fiber slows down digestion and absorption, right?

Please tell me more details about that.

I had also made a video explaining in detail about vinegar and dietary fiber.

In the top right, have a video about vinegar displayed.

I will make sure to display a video about dietary fiber in the bottom left corner.

Take a walk for about 10 minutes after eating.

You mentioned that using glucose in the blood for energy lowers blood sugar levels.

In that case, wouldn't it be better to do a stronger workout instead of just walking?

However, I've heard that exercising right after a meal is not good...

Please tell me more about walking after meals.

I will make sure to have a video about walking after meals in the bottom right corner.
