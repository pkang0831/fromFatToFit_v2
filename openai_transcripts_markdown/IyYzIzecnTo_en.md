The reason alcohol makes you gain weight - Alcohol and Diet Part 1

Hello, this is pkang.

There are many comments asking for information about alcohol.

In this video, I would like to talk about alcohol.

Actually, I made a video about alcohol a while ago.

Since it's an old video, it's not easy to find.

The video is about the topic of whether drinking alcohol without snacks can lead to weight gain.

I created a new video because there are many different questions about alcohol that come up in the comments.

First of all, alcohol has a relatively high calorie content, about 7 kcal per gram.

However, I heard that the calories from alcohol do not turn into body fat?

It's not that body fat doesn't occur at all; it's just that the rate at which it occurs is low.

Because the ratio is so low, it is sometimes expressed as not having body fat.

So there are claims that alcohol does not negatively affect dieting, but in reality, that is not the case.

The human body stores energy in two forms: carbohydrates and fats.

Carbohydrates have the characteristic of being able to quickly increase or decrease their usage.

Fat has the characteristic that its usage cannot be quickly increased or decreased.

So in situations where you suddenly need energy, carbohydrates are used as energy.

In situations where a steady supply of energy is needed, fat is used as energy.

For example, in situations where sudden energy is needed, like during exercise, carbohydrates are used as energy.

In places where a constant supply of energy is needed, like for maintaining body temperature, fat is used as energy.

In the past, it was said that to exercise, you needed to do it for at least 30 minutes or more in order for body fat to be burned.

The reason for this statement is due to the speed at which energy consumption is increasing.

When you suddenly need energy for exercise.

First, use carbohydrates that can quickly increase energy consumption as energy.

The energy usage of fat is gradually increasing, replacing carbohydrates.

The point at which the body starts using more fat than carbohydrates was around 20 to 30 minutes after starting exercise.

So the idea is that you need to exercise for more than 30 minutes.

Let's keep this information in mind and reconsider the calories in alcohol.

Alcohol is quite high in calories at 7 kcal per gram.

It was mentioned that it has the characteristic of not easily converting into body fat.

In other words, the energy gained from drinking alcohol is used somewhere.

Where is it used?

The energy obtained from alcohol is quite substantial, but there is no immediate place to use it.

The easiest way to consume a lot of energy is to let it escape through body temperature.

Drinking alcohol because of this raises your body temperature, causing you to feel hot and have a fever.

However, as mentioned at the beginning of the video,

Supplying energy for maintaining body temperature was originally the job of body fat.

So, if you gain energy from alcohol and your body temperature rises, there is no need to use body fat.

Therefore, the energy expenditure from body fat gradually decreases.

Drinking alcohol raises your body temperature, right?

It is said that when you drink alcohol, your body temperature rises temporarily, but after some time, it decreases.

Yes, that's correct.

So originally, I was using body fat for energy to maintain my body temperature, but...

When you drink alcohol, there is a phenomenon where your body temperature temporarily rises due to the energy from the alcohol.

The energy from alcohol is used to raise body temperature.

The body fat that was used for maintaining body temperature gradually decreases in usage.

Once the drinking session is over and no more alcohol is consumed, the energy supply from alcohol will be cut off.

Since there is no energy supply from alcohol when the usage of body fat is low,

Due to a lack of energy needed to maintain body temperature, the body temperature actually decreases.

If we increase the usage of body fat again to supply the energy needed for maintaining body temperature, it can be resolved, but

As mentioned at the beginning of the video,

The usage of body fat does not increase rapidly nor decrease rapidly.

Until the point where the usage of body fat becomes sufficiently high, a phenomenon of decreased body temperature occurs.

In summary, the calories obtained from alcohol are not stored as body fat.

Drinking alcohol does not directly increase body fat, but...

If you hadn't drunk alcohol, the body fat that would have decreased by being used as energy wouldn't decrease.

Drinking alcohol is not good for dieting.

They say that if you drink alcohol with the same calories instead of eating rice, you might actually lose weight.

That's right. There is actually such an experiment.

However, there are several issues when applying that experiment to reality.

In the next video, I will talk about this.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to display the next video on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the alcohol and diet video, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
