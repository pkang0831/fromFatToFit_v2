The reason why overweight people cannot withstand hunger.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

The reason we become overweight is that we eat too much food.

Therefore, to lose weight, you need to control your meal portions.

However, there are many people who struggle with this.

And I think of this as a matter of will and effort.

So when I see someone who can't control their appetite,

Sometimes, they criticize by saying, "Why can't you even endure that?"

I sometimes feel disappointed in myself and blame myself for not being able to control my appetite.

However, people with a high body fat percentage may find it difficult to control their appetite.

Let's talk about why that is.

The purpose of all living beings, including humans, is survival.

However, a body with a lot of body fat and obesity is not a favorable form for survival.

So when we become obese, our body reacts by trying to reduce body fat on its own.

One of those reactions is an increase in the leptin hormone.

What is the leptin hormone?

It is a hormone that regulates appetite.

In our bodies, there are appetite-regulating hormones called ghrelin and leptin.

Ghrelin is produced to create the sensation of hunger, prompting the desire to eat food.

Leptin is responsible for creating a feeling of fullness, encouraging you to stop eating.

So when body fat increases, the leptin hormone increases, leading to a feeling of fullness.

This means that by feeling full, you reduce your food intake to use body fat.

Something seems strange.

When body fat increases, if the leptin hormone rises,

Isn't it true that the more body fat someone has, the less they should eat?

However, in reality, obese people eat much more.

Why is that?

It's due to leptin resistance.

The human body is regulated by hormones.

Not properly responding to this hormone is called hormone resistance.

Leptin resistance is when the body does not respond properly to the leptin hormone.

Simply put, even if the hormone leptin is released, it becomes difficult to feel full.

When it becomes difficult to feel full, controlling appetite will also become challenging.

There are two main reasons why leptin resistance occurs.

The first is that the body adapts to a situation with high levels of leptin hormone.

As mentioned earlier, when body fat increases, the level of the hormone leptin also rises.

If a state of obesity with high body fat is maintained for a long period of time,

The situation where there is a high level of leptin hormone continues.

In this way, the response to the leptin hormone weakens.

Since there is always a lot of leptin hormone, it becomes recognized as the normal state.

But then, shouldn't obesity not occur in the first place?

We didn't become obese overnight.

Over a long period of time, body fat has gradually increased, leading to obesity.

In the early stages of obesity, when body fat has only slightly increased, leptin resistance has not yet developed.

At that time, when the leptin hormone increased, there would have been a feeling of fullness.

Then, the feeling of fullness should have prevented overeating and obesity.

Yes, that's right.

The problem is that even when I feel full, I end up eating more food.

This is the second factor that creates leptin resistance.

When we eat food, a hormone called insulin is released.

This insulin stores the carbohydrates we eat as glycogen, which is the energy for our muscles.

Help the protein we consume to be used for muscle synthesis.

The fat we consume is stored as body fat.

It is responsible for processing the nutrients obtained from food.

However, there are foods that cause excessive insulin production among the foods we eat.

This is a problem.

A proper amount of insulin is essential for our body, but

If insulin levels become too high,

Even when I'm full, I still feel a fake hunger for food.

In this case, the satiety of the leptin hormone and

The situation arises where fake hunger caused by insulin conflicts with each other.

When you feel full, you should want to stop eating.

Fake hunger makes you want to eat more food.

If this kind of conflict repeats, the body's response to leptin hormone weakens.

Leptin resistance increases.

When leptin resistance increases, it becomes difficult to feel full.

If fake hunger increases your appetite here, then...

This leads to overeating and gaining weight.

In the case of obese individuals, it is difficult for them to feel full due to leptin resistance.

It can be difficult to control appetite because it is hard to feel full.

It's not a matter of will or effort.

It's natural to have difficulties because there are issues with hormone metabolism.

This is not something that deserves criticism, nor is it something to feel guilty about.

It's a problem that needs to be solved.

However, many people are unaware of this mechanism.

While trying to diet, some people recklessly eat less or even starve themselves.

This can lead to stronger leptin resistance.

Because right now, it's difficult to control appetite due to leptin resistance.

In such situations, forcing oneself to starve or eat less can cause significant stress.

This stress also has the effect of increasing appetite.

The false hunger caused by insulin clashes with the leptin hormone, increasing leptin resistance.

Increased appetite due to stress can also conflict with the leptin hormone, leading to higher leptin resistance.

The actions taken for dieting are actually making the diet even harder.

How can we solve the problem of leptin resistance?

You shouldn't starve or eat too little; you need to eat enough food.

You need to change the types of food you eat at this time.

There are three causes of leptin resistance.

The first is the excessive secretion of the leptin hormone due to a high amount of body fat.

The second is false hunger caused by excessive insulin secretion.

The third is an increase in appetite due to stress.

First, to prevent an increase in appetite due to stress,

It means that you shouldn't force yourself to eat less or skip meals while enduring hunger.

But how do you diet if you don't eat less or skip meals?

You can change the types of food you eat.

As mentioned earlier,

Some of the foods we eat cause excessive insulin production.

Such foods create false hunger, which is the second cause of leptin resistance.

However, if you change the types of foods you eat to those that do not cause excessive insulin production,

The false hunger will decrease.

When fake hunger decreases, leptin resistance improves.

In this way, appetite itself decreases, so the amount of food consumed naturally decreases.

I want to eat and I'm hungry, but instead of forcing myself to hold back and eat less,

I don't want to eat, so I'm eating less.

This way, you can diet without difficulty and without stress.

The part that appeared at the beginning of the video.

You actively utilize the body's natural response to reduce body fat.

This is how to do a diet.

Don't just try to eat less or starve yourself aimlessly.

Do not blame those who cannot control their appetite or criticize yourself.

You can start by changing the types of food you eat.
