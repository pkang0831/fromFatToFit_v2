I ate less food for my diet, and now my stomach has shrunk, so I feel full even after eating just a little.

This is the content of a diet review that can commonly be found on the internet.

I see that there are people asking in the comments about how to reduce that line after reading the story.

To conclude, that is a story with errors.

Isn't that a personal experience? What kind of error are you talking about?

A person who originally needed to eat a lot of food to feel satisfied has become obese from eating a lot of food.

After dieting, I became satisfied with just a little food.

This is a completely possible thing.

However, the cause is not that the stomach is shrinking.

If I ate less food, my stomach shrank, and

In a state where the stomach has shrunk, even a small amount of food is satisfying.

If this story is true, there should be no yo-yo effect when dieting with a low-calorie diet.

A low-calorie diet is a diet that involves eating less food.

When following that diet, the stomach would have shrunk.

If your stomach has shrunk and you feel satisfied eating less food, then...

There’s no reason to eat so much food that it leads to yo-yo dieting.

However, in reality, due to a compensation mentality, many people engage in binge eating.

Most cases of yo-yo dieting are due to binge eating.

There are cases where binge eating leads to weight fluctuations, but there are also the opposite cases.

The amount I used to eat before dieting was sufficient.

I heard that after dieting, if you eat the same amount, your stomach feels more bloated and you can't eat as much.

If it's not because the stomach has shrunk, then what is the reason for that?

I have mentioned this several times in other videos as well.

If you follow a low-calorie diet for an extended period, your basal metabolic rate will decrease.

Basal metabolic rate is the energy used by major organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, and digestive organs.

A decrease in basal metabolic rate means that the functions of organs, including the digestive system, are declining.

When the digestive system is functioning properly, it is the amount of food that could be eaten and digested sufficiently.

Since the function of the digestive system is reduced, it cannot digest properly, leading to a feeling of bloating.

Whatever the reason may be...

It's because you can't digest well when you eat a lot, so you probably wouldn't want to eat a lot.

In that case, it must be good for dieting, right?

No, that's not the case. It's actually not good for dieting.

When the digestive system weakens,

Since I can't digest food well, I prefer softer foods over harder ones.

If you eat a large amount, it can be hard to digest, so you tend to prefer eating smaller portions.

However, even if you eat a small amount, you still need to obtain the necessary calories.

You will find foods that are low in volume but high in calories.

So, we end up looking for foods that are quickly digestible and absorbable while also having a high nutritional density.

This is exactly the kind of food that makes you gain weight.

So, it cannot be said that weakening the digestive system is good for dieting.

The reason why such foods are considered fattening is...

I talked in detail about how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight in the video.

There are many diet testimonials on the internet that say their stomachs have shrunk, so they feel full after eating just a little.

If that's wrong... why are there so many people saying that?

It is because I do not know the reason for being satisfied with little food.

The reason we become obese is that we eat a lot of food.

The reason for eating a lot of food is that the appetite has become abnormally high.

Many people think that their appetite in this state is their original appetite.

Having an appetite to eat so much food that it leads to obesity is not normal.

For some reason, appetite has increased abnormally, and as a result, one eats so much that it leads to obesity.

To diet, you first need to normalize your appetite.

When appetite returns to normal, the desire to eat decreases.

When the desire to eat decreases, you become satisfied with just a little bit of food.

This is the easiest way to diet.

For someone who is unaware of this information, it can be confusing when their appetite returns to normal.

They believe that eating a large amount of food to the point of obesity is their original appetite.

I don't understand why my appetite has decreased.

So I am trying to find the cause elsewhere.

I think it's because the size of the pouch that holds the food has gotten smaller.

However, a person who can stop eating when they are full will not become obese.

I'm full, but it's so delicious that I want to take another bite.

Even if you have eaten a hearty meal, a person gains weight by additionally consuming sweet drinks and desserts.

So regardless of the size above, it is the desire to eat that causes weight gain.

Even if the food above is sufficiently full and you feel satisfied with it,

When you feel an appetite to eat more, your stomach expands to create empty space.

So, even someone who finds it difficult to drink 2 liters of water can drink the same amount of beer.

So just because the size above has decreased, it doesn't mean that you should eat moderately and be satisfied.

You need to normalize your abnormal appetite so that you can eat less and feel satisfied.

What causes an abnormally high appetite? How can I bring it back to normal?

I talked about it in detail in the appetite series I created before.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have the appetite series appear on the right.
