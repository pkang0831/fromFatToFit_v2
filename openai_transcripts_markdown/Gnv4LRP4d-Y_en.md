The realistic diet of someone who is too tired and exhausted to exercise.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I know that both diet and exercise are important in a diet, but...

Just going to school or work makes everyday life so busy and difficult.

I lack the time or energy to exercise.

If you somehow make time and force yourself to exercise,

The next day, I was so tired that it affected my daily life.

What should I do?

There have been many questions about this topic, so I would like to discuss it.

Isn't that all just an excuse?

Many people think that way.

In fact, the time to exercise is not something that is specifically set aside.

I need to make time to exercise.

If you are struggling with daily life due to a lack of physical strength and cannot exercise,

Rather, you need to exercise to build your strength.

However, I'm already busy with daily life and don't have time.

How to make time for exercise?

I'm already tired and struggling with daily life, so is it possible to exercise in that state?

Even if you have to force yourself, if you exercise...

The next day, I feel so tired and exhausted that it interferes with my daily life.

What should I do about this?

In a state of not knowing this information,

It may not be an excuse, but you might really not know what to do.

In this video, let's talk about how to solve this problem.

In order for a person to move their body, they must use their muscles.

And to use muscles, oxygen and energy are needed.

Oxygen enters the body through the lungs, and

Oxygen and energy are delivered to the muscles through the blood.

The heart is responsible for sending this blood to the muscles.

In order for muscles to generate sufficient strength, the capabilities of the heart and lungs are important.

These two are combined to refer to cardiovascular capacity.

If I build muscle through exercise,

During the process of exercising, cardiovascular fitness develops.

Therefore, both muscle and cardiovascular abilities grow together. It's a balanced approach.

However, if your muscles grow without exercising,

When cardiovascular capacity is not developed, only the muscles grow, leading to an imbalance.

This becomes a problem.

Is it possible to build muscle without exercising?

Yes, it is possible.

When weight increases, the body becomes heavier.

To move a heavy body, you need more muscles.

The muscles needed to move a body weighing 50 kg and

The muscles needed to move a body weighing 60 kg cannot be the same.

If a person with severe obesity measures their body composition using InBody,

Even with no exercise experience, the muscle mass can be quite high.

So when I gain weight,

To move my heavy body, my muscle mass has increased.

It means that there is a lack of cardiovascular capacity needed to use those muscles.

To make it easier to understand, for example,

As the company grew, the amount of work increased to the equivalent of what 100 people would do.

You can think of it as the situation where there are still 10 people working.

In this case, 10 people will have to work ten times harder, so it will be very tiring and difficult.

If there is an imbalance between muscle strength and cardiovascular ability,

Just moving my body makes daily life difficult and exhausting.

So, unconsciously, I try to move as little as possible or

In situations where I need to move, I try to move slowly to reduce the burden.

When behavior slows down like this, it takes more time to do the same tasks.

So that's why I always feel short on time and busy.

The way to solve this problem is to increase physical activity.

In situations where cardiovascular capacity is insufficient, moving the body becomes burdensome.

So you said that you tend to not move at all or try to move slowly unconsciously.

This is the reason why the imbalance between muscle strength and cardiovascular ability is not resolved.

So you need to intentionally move your body.

For example, you can set aside about an hour a day to do walking exercises.

Light exercises like walking are not very strenuous because they are not high in intensity, so they are not too difficult.

Therefore, it does not interfere with daily life the next day.

If it's difficult to set aside an hour for walking exercise, you can do just 30 minutes.

If it's difficult to make even for 30 minutes,

After having lunch, instead of sitting and resting, you should walk for about 10 to 20 minutes.

When I engage in more activities than usual, I use my muscles more.

When you use your muscles a lot, your cardiovascular capacity also develops to support those muscles.

When cardiovascular capacity develops and is balanced with muscle,

Moving my body is no longer a difficult task.

If it is not difficult for me to move my body

My body, which was tired and exhausted just from daily life, is now able to handle that much.

Then, as actions become faster, the time needed to do the same tasks will decrease.

Creating a surplus of physical strength and time comes first, and exercise follows after that.

So to summarize...

Just like everything in the world requires preparation, exercise also needs preparation.

If even moving my body in daily life is difficult for me,

That's a situation where I'm not ready to exercise.

In such situations, it's natural that trying to exercise doesn't go well.

Moreover, people who start exercising for the purpose of dieting are

There are times when I try to reduce my food intake and exercise.

If you reduce your food intake and create a lack of energy while not being ready to exercise,

Of course, I can't exercise.

First, increase your activity level to get used to moving your body.

Exercise comes after that.

I am trying to lose weight by eating low-calorie diet meals.

I feel so weak that I can hardly even walk for exercise.

What should I do in this case?

You need to change the way you approach dieting.

Many people reduce the calories they get from food.

I think that in order to reduce body fat, you need to put your body in a calorie deficit.

You don't have to do it that way if you don't want to.

You can reduce body fat without eating less.

Even if you don't eat less, how body fat decreases is about

I explained it in detail in another video before.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

If you're curious about how body fat can decrease without eating less, you can click here to find out.

If you can lose weight without eating less, can you still eat the snacks and chicken you usually eat?

No, that's not the case.

I told you not to eat less. I didn't say to eat processed foods.

You need to change the types of food you eat.

Why we need to change the types of food we eat and how to make those changes.

I made a video that explains in detail.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.
