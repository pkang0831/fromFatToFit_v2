Is eating a little bit often bad for dieting?

Hello, this is pkang.

These days, there is a lot of talk about how having fasting periods, like intermittent fasting, is good for dieting.

In the past, there was a lot of talk about how eating small amounts frequently is good for dieting.

There was a comment asking why there is such a difference between the past and the present.

In the last video, I talked in detail about the reasons for that.

For those who haven't seen the video, let me briefly summarize the content.

When consuming processed refined foods, a large amount of insulin is released.

Due to the large amount of insulin secreted, a false sense of hunger occurs.

This false hunger leads to overeating, which causes obesity.

To diet, it is important to reduce the intake of refined foods.

In the past, the concepts of refined and unrefined foods were not well established.

I was just trying to diet while continuing to eat processed foods.

If you eat a lot of processed foods, you experience intense false hunger, making it difficult to diet.

I recommended the method of eating little by little and frequently.

Recently, there has been a recommendation to reduce the intake of refined foods and to encourage the consumption of unrefined foods.

Unprocessed foods can be eaten in larger quantities without experiencing false hunger, so there is no need to eat small amounts frequently.

So eat enough food and don't eat during the remaining time.

There is a trend of practicing fasting periods.

At the end of that video, there was a question about eating unrefined foods little by little and more frequently.

I understand that when you eat unprocessed foods, you don't experience false hunger, so there's no need to eat small amounts frequently.

I find it convenient to eat that way and I want to eat that way, but isn't eating small amounts frequently good for dieting?

It was such a question.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

To conclude, there isn't much difference when it comes to eating unrefined foods.

In intermittent fasting, when you eat, insulin is released, which makes it difficult to lose weight.

I heard that there must be a fasting period.

If you eat small amounts frequently, doesn't that lead to frequent insulin secretion, which is not good for dieting?

No, it is not.

To understand this, we need to know how insulin makes us obese through its processes.

Insulin is a hormone that primarily functions to process nutrients.

It can lower blood sugar levels that have risen due to carbohydrates.

It also helps to be used for muscle synthesis.

It also stores fat as body fat.

So when a lot of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins enter the body, a lot of insulin is also needed.

I talked about how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods in the video.

Processed refined foods that make us gain weight are

It refers to foods that are high in nutrient content, can be eaten in large quantities, and are quickly digested and absorbed.

Eating such foods allows a large amount of nutrients to enter the body in a short period of time.

To process a large amount of nutrients, a significant amount of insulin would be urgently needed.

However, when insulin is secreted in a hurry, it tends to be released in amounts much greater than what is actually needed.

This becomes a problem.

Blood sugar levels need to be maintained within a certain range.

If insulin is secreted too much, blood sugar levels can drop too low.

The body recognizes that it needs to raise blood sugar levels again.

So it sends a signal that food is needed to raise blood sugar levels.

And if fat that should originally be used as energy is stored as body fat instead,

Because there is a lack of energy to use right away, signals indicating the need for food start to emerge.

So it's not that there is a lack of food that triggers the signal that food is needed, but rather...

The excessive secretion of insulin sends signals that more food is needed.

The hunger that arises from such signals is called false hunger.

If you eat according to this false hunger, you will gradually become obese.

So, when too much insulin is secreted, it interferes with dieting and leads to obesity.

In other words,

If insulin is not secreted too much, it can be said that it is not a problem.

Now, let's return to the question that was mentioned at the beginning of the video.

Does eating small amounts of food frequently cause insulin to be released, which interferes with dieting?

If you eat food frequently but in small amounts, insulin is released often, but not in large quantities.

If insulin is not secreted in large amounts, it is not a problem.

Simply put, it means that if you eat frequently but in small amounts, it is possible to diet.

In fact, in the video I made before this one, I talked about my past dieting experiences.

In the past, the concepts of refined and unrefined foods were not clearly established.

Eating refined foods in small amounts frequently has been regarded as the standard approach to dieting.

Many people have successfully lost weight using that method for over a decade.

It has already been proven that you can lose weight by eating frequently but in small amounts.

However, suddenly eating a little bit often will not help with dieting.

If you make this claim, it leads to a logical error.

Returning to the original story.

In a situation where you are eating unrefined foods, which is better: having a fasting period or eating small amounts frequently?

These two are not very different. So you can choose the method that suits you best.

Even if you eat processed foods, if you eat them in small amounts frequently, it is possible to lose weight.

Many people succeeded in dieting using that method, but there was one problem.

It's just annoyance.

In a state of false hunger, the desire to eat is strong.

I didn't find it bothersome to prepare 5 or 6 meals, and I consistently made sure to eat them.

As appetite is regulated, false hunger disappears.

Preparing 5 or 6 meals a day is bothersome, and it becomes increasingly tedious to eat on schedule.

So there were cases where people returned to their original eating habits and became obese again.

So the biggest problem with this diet method is that preparing the food is too bothersome.

For reference, among those who prefer intermittent fasting,

There are people who like the fact that they don't have to eat breakfast.

It's hard to eat in the morning because I'm busy and don't have time.

I prefer a diet that allows me not to eat rather than a diet that insists on having breakfast regularly.

It's the same for those who find it bothersome to prepare meals often, even if it's not specifically in the morning.

That's why many people refer to intermittent fasting as a sustainable dieting method.

If I were to be included among such people,

It means that you don't have to bother with eating small portions frequently; you can just eat normally.

Because there isn't much difference in effect anyway.

On the contrary, I have a habit of eating small amounts, so I don't like to eat a lot at once.

And preparing food is not a hassle.

In this case, it's okay to eat a little bit often.

Similarly, there is no difference in effectiveness.

Because I personally prefer that way, it is sustainable, so there is no issue of inconvenience.

But isn't there no difference between eating unprocessed foods and intermittent fasting or eating small amounts frequently?

It's not so much that there is no difference, but rather...

This means that the effective amount of food and the number of meals vary for each person.

The reason for reducing the intake of processed foods is to eliminate false hunger.

When false hunger disappears,

When my body actually needed food, only the real hunger remained.

The amount of food I eat based on this real hunger is the right amount for my body.

In the first place, everyone is different.

Everyone's body is different, and their activity levels and exercise amounts vary.

Then, the amount absorbed when people eat varies from person to person.

The energy consumed varies with the basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate.

The situations and frequency for having meals may vary.

The same amount of food, the same number of meals, and the same fasting duration for everyone.

Is the best thing reasonable?

This obviously doesn't make sense.

A person who works in an office job without exercising and sitting down.

A person engaged in fieldwork who exercises and runs around.

It is natural that the amount of food and the number of meals needed for these two people are different.

I am eating unrefined food, and I want to have three meals a day.

That means my lifestyle and body require three meals a day.

Is it more effective for dieting to forcefully reduce meals to two and endure hunger?

That's not the case.

If you force yourself to endure hunger, you might overeat as a form of compensation or end up giving up halfway.

On the contrary, if my lifestyle and body are sufficient with just two meals a day, then...

Dividing it into three or four meals is quite a hassle and cumbersome task.

Trying to force yourself to do this will eventually lead you to give up out of frustration.

In a video I made before titled [The Reasons You Find Dieting Difficult], I talked about...

Many people think that in order to diet, they need to do something new.

But the truth is, it's not that we need to do something new.

I need to avoid things that make me obese.

I reduce refined foods that cause confusion in my body and eat unrefined foods.

Please use this as a basis.

It is best to eat in a way that is comfortable for you, tailored to your body and lifestyle.

You can achieve your diet just by doing that.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

On the right, I will have a video titled [Reasons Why You Find Dieting Difficult].
