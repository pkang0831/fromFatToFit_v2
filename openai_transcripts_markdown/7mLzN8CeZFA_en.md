If I make sure to take in enough calories even when I'm hungry, will my basal metabolic rate not decrease?

Eating foods like cabbage that are low in calories but high in volume...

Even if you eat a lot and feel full, your basal metabolic rate decreases because the calories are low.

When the basal metabolic rate decreases, it becomes easier to gain weight.

On the contrary, what happens if you eat foods that are low in volume but high in calories?

A question like this was posted in the comments.

If you eat a lot of low-volume but high-calorie foods, it's natural that you will gain weight.

So it's not a question about situations where one eats a lot.

This is a question about the situation of eating a small amount in accordance with the calories my body burns in a day.

The calories are high, but the volume is small.

If you control your calories, the amount you eat will decrease.

If you eat a small amount, you will feel hungry because your stomach won't be full.

In this situation, I'm hungry, but it's not that I'm lacking calories.

In that case, even if the calories are sufficient, does hunger lower the basal metabolic rate and cause weight gain?

Or you asked if there are no problems since you are hungry but have enough calories.

That's an interesting question. Let me talk about it.

The question being asked is what is more important, hunger or calories?

This question has an error in itself, so it's a bit difficult to answer.

Because for that question to be valid, the feeling of fullness must be determined by the volume of food.

So, foods that are low in calories but high in volume are

The volume is large, so my stomach feels full, but the actual calories should be insufficient.

Foods that are high in calories but low in volume are

The volume is small, so I'm hungry, but the actual calories need to be sufficient.

However, the feeling of fullness is not determined by the volume of food.

That question cannot be valid.

A typical example is bulletproof coffee.

Bulletproof coffee is coffee made by adding fats like butter, coconut oil, and MCT oil.

Since it's a cup of coffee, the volume is very small.

However, the calories are quite high because fat has been added.

If the feeling of fullness is determined by the volume of food,

Bulletproof coffee should have little to no satiety, or if it does, it should be very minimal.

That's not actually the case.

People who drink bulletproof coffee in the first place are

I drink bulletproof coffee as a meal replacement because it provides a feeling of fullness.

So, is it that the feeling of fullness is determined by calories rather than the volume of food?

No, that's not the case.

Foods that are low in calories but high in volume can also provide a feeling of fullness.

In fact, foods like cabbage are low in calories but have a large volume, which provides a feeling of fullness.

But this is not where it ends.

If you are someone interested in dieting,

You may have heard that protein provides a feeling of fullness.

So, adding fat to coffee to increase the calories, like in bulletproof coffee, also provides a feeling of fullness.

Foods like carbohydrates that are low in calories and high in volume, such as vegetables, also provide a feeling of fullness.

Protein also provides a feeling of fullness.

When you gather all of this together, it ultimately shows that carbohydrates, fats, and proteins all provide a sense of fullness.

So when you eat foods that are low in volume but high in calories,

It is not possible for a situation to exist where the volume is small and you are hungry, but the calories are not insufficient.

If there are enough calories, it creates a feeling of fullness.

So, which is more important: hunger or the actual calories consumed?

I cannot answer this question.

There is an error in the question itself from the beginning.

So I will change the question a bit.

Foods that are large in volume but low in calories, like cabbage, are said to be good for dieting.

In reality, a lack of calorie intake leads to a decrease in the basal metabolic rate.

Due to its large volume, it causes the stomach to expand, which is not good for dieting.

On the contrary, what problems are associated with foods that are low in volume but high in calories?

I will talk about this.

Wait a minute!! Are you saying that cabbage is bad for dieting?

Cabbage itself is rich in nutrients, which makes it a good food for dieting.

Utilizing the characteristics of cabbage, which is large in volume and low in calories,

If the goal is to consume a lot while keeping calorie intake low,

That means it's not necessarily good for dieting.

There was a question about this before, so I made a response video.

I will make sure to include related videos at the end.

Returning to the original story.

To get straight to the point, if you only eat foods that are low in quantity but high in calories,

Calories may be sufficient, but it can lead to a decrease in basal metabolic rate or obesity.

If you want to eat foods that are high in calories but low in volume, you inevitably have to eat fewer vegetables.

Vegetables are foods that have a large volume but low calories.

However, if you eat fewer vegetables, your intake of the vitamins and minerals found in vegetables will decrease.

Vitamins and minerals like these are involved in metabolism.

If vitamins and minerals become too deficient,

This can lead to a decrease in basal metabolic rate or obesity.

So there is also the argument that obesity is not a symptom of excessive nutrition, but rather a symptom of nutritional deficiency.

The cause of obesity is eating a lot, but can that lead to nutritional deficiencies?

This means that it is so from the perspective of vitamins and minerals.

In fact, junk food is high in carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and it has a high calorie content, but

Vitamins and minerals are very low.

If you eat a diet primarily consisting of junk food without consuming vegetables and fruits separately,

If you base it on carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and calories, it becomes nutritional excess.

However, if we consider vitamins and minerals, it would lead to nutritional deficiencies.

This means that obesity is caused by this nutritional deficiency.

In statistics that actually investigate childhood obesity and income levels,

The rate of childhood obesity was higher among children from low-income families.

The reason is that children from wealthy families eat a variety of vegetables and fruits, which leads to a good nutritional balance.

Children from impoverished families do not eat vegetables and fruits that are expensive and difficult to store.

There is also a saying that it's because people tend to eat processed foods that are inexpensive and easy to store.

However, not all foods that are small in volume and high in calories are junk food, right?

Is there a case where you eat food that is not junk food, but has a small volume and high calories?

There are cases like that. There are diet plans like that.

The idea that consuming too many carbohydrates is a cause of obesity has become widely known.

Various types of low-carb, high-fat diets have been introduced in Korea.

Among them, the intake of carbohydrates is strictly limited.

Protein and fat intake is allowed without restriction.

At the same time, there was a diet that emphasized eating as healthily as possible.

There are no restrictions on the intake of protein and fat.

I was able to eat meat, butter, and oil freely.

I need to eat as healthily as possible.

Eating cattle that have been raised on pasture and fed grass.

Eating butter made from the milk of such cows

If you are going to eat olive oil, you should eat extra virgin olive oil.

It was said that regular salt is not acceptable and that one should consume Himalayan pink salt instead.

That diet definitely had a weight loss effect from a dieting perspective.

While limiting carbohydrate intake, the consumption of junk food is prohibited.

If you prohibit the consumption of junk food, it will lead to weight loss effects.

However, the effects of that diet did not last.

In order for a person to live, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are all necessary.

Limiting carbohydrate intake has caused various problems.

When you restrict carbohydrates, you inevitably limit your intake of vegetables.

In this case, the problem mentioned at the beginning of the video will lead to a decrease in basal metabolic rate.

Even if you eat protein and fat very healthily and obtain enough vitamins and minerals from them,

There are vitamins and minerals that can only be obtained from vegetables.

And carbohydrates are the source of glycogen, which is the energy for muscles.

Restricting carbohydrates leads to a lack of glycogen, which prevents the muscles from exerting strength.

If the muscles are unable to exert strength, the level of activity and exercise will decrease.

I have mentioned it a few times in other videos as well.

Visceral fat is the type of fat that effectively decreases when following a diet, but

Subcutaneous fat is the type of fat that decreases when you increase your activity level and exercise.

In a situation where carbohydrate intake is insufficient, leading to a decrease in activity and exercise levels, body fat does not easily burn off.

And if carbohydrate restriction continues, the desire for carbohydrates increases.

It wasn't easy to stick to the diet.

So for a while, it was very popular, but now the number of people doing it has decreased significantly.

Even if you try to eat as healthily as possible for these reasons,

Eating only low-fat and high-calorie foods can be problematic.

As I always say, it's best to eat a variety of unprocessed foods.

After hearing the story, it seems that vitamins and minerals are very important.

When you see advertisements for diet supplements or diet foods,

They say that certain vitamins and minerals are abundant and that they have a weight loss effect.

Is it really effective? Should we buy some and try it?

The same question came up before, so I made a related video.

In a moment, two videos will appear on the screen.

On the left, set it up to show videos discussing diet supplements or diet foods.

On the right, I will have a video discussing how cabbage causes the upper part to expand.

You can choose and watch the video that interests you among the two videos.
