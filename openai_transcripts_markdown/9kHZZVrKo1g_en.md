Please pause the screen and check the question content first.

It seems that I've encountered a problem because I drastically reduced my food intake since my weight isn't decreasing. What should I do?

To explain the background of the question...

There is a video I made in the past titled "The Reason Why Fasting Diets Are Unfair."

When reducing meal portions for dieting, the following may occur:

It's a video listing the disadvantages to the body.

It seems that you are on a diet to reduce your food intake because your weight hasn't decreased.

After watching the video, you recognize the issues and ask how to resolve them.

The video link is available in the top right corner, so if you're curious about the content, you can click to watch it.

First, I will briefly go over the content of the video.

The reasons why starvation diets are unfair can be summarized in three main points.

The first is the increase in absorption rate.

The second is a decrease in metabolic rate.

The third issue is that the body fat, which was originally decreasing, is no longer decreasing.

When we think about it, if I reduce the amount I eat, I will lose weight.

If you keep eating less, you'll continue to have a calorie deficit, so I think your weight will keep decreasing.

That's not actually the case.

Because the absorption rate of food increases.

Even if you eat the same amount, the number of calories that enter your body will increase.

On the other hand, as various metabolic rates decrease, the amount of energy used by the body decreases.

Even if you stay still here, the body fat that originally decreased will no longer decrease.

These three factors combined clearly lead to a plateau, even though I have reduced my food intake.

If you eat here again, these three factors will combine and lead to a yo-yo effect.

There isn't any special strategy.

You should gradually increase your meal portions with unrefined foods.

As the amount of food intake increases, it is natural for weight to also increase.

However, the amount of fat among the increased weight is not significant, so don't be too surprised or worried.

If the weight gain is not due to fat, what is causing the weight to increase?

The statement that the meal portion was small means that there was a deficiency in carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

If you return your meal portions to normal, what was lacking in your body will return to an average level.

During this process, weight will increase.

When carbohydrates enter the body, they are stored in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen.

Glycogen is stored with water.

Your weight will increase by the amount of glycogen and water stored in your body.

Since the amount of the second meal has increased, the amount of stool in the body will also increase.

When eating unrefined foods, the intake of dietary fiber increases.

Dietary fiber absorbs water, which helps to increase the bulk of stool.

So the weight of the stool can be more than you might expect.

The weight of the feces in the body will cause an increase in body weight.

If you have maintained a low food intake for a long time during your third meal, muscle loss may have occurred.

If I consume enough calories and protein,

The muscles needed for daily life will grow to their original size.

As the amount of muscle increases, your weight will increase by the weight of the muscle.

As the amount of muscle increases, the glycogen storage capacity also increases.

When the glycogen storage increases, body weight also increases by the weight of glycogen and water.

Fourth, if a hunger response occurs in the body,

It shows a response to store a certain amount of food as body fat in preparation for when it will be starving again.

Body fat increases, and body weight increases by the amount of body fat.

You might dislike it because body fat is increasing.

You cannot eliminate the hunger response without increasing body fat.

Because I am hungry, my body feels anxious, and due to that anxiety, I want to stockpile emergency food.

After our body accumulates a level of body fat that it feels secure with, the hunger response is resolved.

After the hunger response is released, you can reduce body fat, so don't worry too much.

To summarize,

There are no special strategies other than increasing your meal portions with unrefined foods.

If you increase your meal portions with unrefined foods, your weight will temporarily increase significantly.

The proportion of fat among the weight gained is not that high.

You don't need to be too surprised or worried.

Sounds plausible, right?
