A question about hunger has been posted in the comments.

Mr. pkang, I am practicing intermittent fasting.

I was so hungry that it was really difficult to stick to the fasting schedule.

However, there are many people who say that you can enjoy hunger.

Isn't it natural for a person to want to eat when they are hungry?

I know that if you force yourself to endure hunger, it leads to binge eating due to a compensation psychology.

Does it make sense to enjoy hunger?

If it makes sense, what should I do?

That's an interesting question, isn't it? Let me elaborate on it.

First, to briefly explain intermittent fasting,

It is a dietary method that involves intentionally not eating during fasting periods.

In modern society, there is an abundance of food, making it easy to eat frequently and in large quantities.

Eating food this often and in such large quantities is causing various health problems, including obesity.

If you intentionally have a fasting period where you do not eat food,

It helps to address various health issues, including obesity.

There are now various methods that have been transformed.

The most basic form is the 16:8 intermittent fasting, where you fast for 16 hours each day and eat for 8 hours.

There is a 5:2 intermittent fasting method where you eat three meals a day for five days a week and fast for 24 hours on two days.

The 16:8 intermittent fasting may seem like a long fasting period of 16 hours every day, but

Since sleep time is included, you actually don't need to have a meal in the morning.

The 5:2 intermittent fasting may seem too long at 24 hours, but...

The fast begins after having dinner the night before.

The next morning, if you skip lunch and have dinner, it will be a 24-hour fast.

I also explained about intermittent fasting, but...

Depending on how long the fasting period is, it can be divided into the 16:8 and 5:2 methods.

I often explain about fasting times in a natural way.

This strongly reinforces the awareness that the duration of fasting is very important.

So if you fast for 16 hours every day,

It is said that appetite is naturally regulated and that one comes to enjoy hunger.

That's not true.

For a person to live, major organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs must function actively.

Energy is consumed in this process.

This is commonly referred to as the basal metabolic rate.

A person consumes energy at their basal metabolic rate every moment, including while sleeping.

I can't keep eating food every moment.

So when you eat food, some of it is stored as body fat.

During the time when you are not eating, your body is designed to use that body fat as energy.

This is the body's basic metabolism.

Dieting occurs when the amount of body fat used is greater than the amount of body fat stored.

The overall amount of body fat is decreasing.

Just because you are on a diet doesn't mean you completely stop storing body fat.

The hormone that causes an increase in body fat is called insulin.

On the contrary, the hormone that helps reduce body fat is called glucagon.

Insulin and glucagon have opposing functions.

When insulin increases, glucagon decreases.

When insulin decreases, glucagon increases.

So when you eat, insulin increases, and some of the food is stored as body fat.

As time passes and insulin decreases, glucagon increases.

The increased glucagon converts the body fat stored earlier into energy.

However, there are foods that cause the pancreas to secrete more insulin than necessary.

Eating such foods causes an excessive release of insulin.

If too much insulin is produced, the amount of stored body fat will increase.

And when too much insulin is produced, it takes a long time to lower it.

When insulin decreases, glucagon is released.

Glucagon needs to be released in order to use stored body fat as energy.

It takes a long time to lower insulin, so the release of glucagon is delayed.

During that delayed time, the body is unable to use body fat as energy.

As mentioned earlier, a person continuously consumes energy through their basal metabolic rate.

The energy obtained from the food I just ate has turned into a lot of body fat due to the high insulin levels.

To convert stored body fat into energy, glucagon is needed.

Due to the high levels of insulin, glucagon cannot be released, which prevents the body from using stored body fat as energy.

In this case, our body will immediately lack the energy it needs.

Therefore, our body determines that it needs food.

Since the body cannot obtain energy from within, it tries to bring it in from outside through food.

So, to encourage eating, we create hunger.

There is no surplus because there is a lack of energy available for immediate use.

Therefore, it makes this hunger very strong.

It's really difficult to endure such strong hunger.

On the contrary, if you eat foods that do not produce much insulin...

Because there is not much insulin, the body fat that is not used for energy and is stored is low.

Therefore, there is no immediate energy shortage.

And since there isn't much insulin, it takes a shorter time to lower that insulin.

If the time to lower insulin is short, the time for glucagon to be released becomes faster.

When glucagon is released, stored body fat can be used as energy.

So there is no immediate energy shortage.

Even if energy is lacking, you can use body fat.

You no longer need to eat food.

So, when you eat foods that do not cause a lot of insulin to be released, you feel full for a longer time.

Even if time passes and hunger arises, it is not severe.

In a word, it's about having leisure.

Since I am not very hungry, it is not difficult to endure the hunger.

Since it's not difficult to endure hunger, you come to enjoy it.

So, for someone who doesn't change the types of food they eat and is very hungry,

If I'm this hungry, how can I enjoy hunger? This question arises.

It's hard to stick to a 16-hour fast because I'm very hungry, so I might give up in the middle.

Even if you manage to stick to fasting times with difficulty, it is common to end up binge eating due to a compensation mentality.

On the contrary, a person whose hunger has diminished by changing the types of food they eat is...

Because hunger is weak, one can enjoy hunger.

Since I enjoy hunger, it's not difficult to stick to the fasting schedule.

Since it's not difficult to stick to the fasting hours, there is no sense of compensation.

There is no reason to binge eat.

This is the difference between someone who finds it hard to endure hunger and someone who enjoys being hungry.

So if you change the types of food you eat, you won't feel as hungry.

So that means it's easy to do intermittent fasting.

Even if you don't practice intermittent fasting, it seems like it would still be good for dieting as long as you don't feel too hungry.

So how do we distinguish the types of important foods?

I tried intermittent fasting but gave up because it was too difficult.

After watching the video, I want to challenge myself once again.

Please tell me in detail about intermittent fasting.

In a moment, two videos will appear on the screen.

On the left, there will be a video explaining how to categorize different types of food.

On the right, I will have a video that explains intermittent fasting in detail.

You can choose and watch the videos you need.
