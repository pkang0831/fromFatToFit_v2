Eating all three meals a day at McDonald's.

I saw a story on YouTube Shorts about someone who lost 27 kg in just 6 months.

How is this possible?

A question with this content has been posted.

First of all, what is mentioned in the question is the story of an experiment by a person named John C. Sisson.

I eat all three meals at McDonald's every day, but...

According to the health guidelines of the U.S. FDA, consume less than 2000 kcal per day.

I conducted an experiment to observe how my body changes by walking for 45 minutes every day.

My weight, which was 127kg, has decreased by 16.8kg in three months, bringing it down to 110.2kg.

We decided to extend the experiment for another three months.

An additional 10.9 kg was lost, bringing the final weight to 99.3 kg.

I lost approximately 27.7 kg over the course of six months.

I became famous for this and even wrote a book about dieting.

I also became a McDonald's ambassador.

It is commonly perceived that McDonald's fast food is not good for dieting.

The question is how it is possible to lose 27 kg by only eating McDonald's food.

Let's talk in detail.

Which food did you eat from the McDonald's menu?

The menu eaten on the 38th day is well-known.

For breakfast, I had a McMuffin, oatmeal, hash browns, and low-fat milk, totaling 1040 kcal.

For lunch, I had a bacon salad, yogurt, and an apple, totaling 360 kcal.

For dinner, I had a chicken sandwich, Caesar salad, and diet cola, totaling 580 kcal.

It's a McDonald's diet, but there are no burgers like the Big Mac or fries?

It's not just any cola; it's diet cola.

Yes, that's right.

In fact, if you look at it in detail, the McMuffin I had for breakfast can be considered a hamburger.

Hash browns are made by frying potatoes, so they can be considered a type of fried potato. However,

Calories of McMuffin and Big Mac  
If we compare the calories of hash browns and French fries

There is roughly a difference of about 2 times.

So many people are making an issue out of this part.

They claim it's a McDonald's diet, but...

Without eating the most popular hamburger, fries, and cola at McDonald's.

I mainly ate low-calorie menu items and salads that I don't usually enjoy at McDonald's.

However, even after eating a hamburger, fries, and cola,

If you have been following the rule of staying under 2000 calories a day well,

The result itself regarding weight loss likely hasn't changed.

There is a claim that hamburgers surprisingly do not make you gain weight, but...

They say that French fries and cola are really bad for a diet.

Are you saying that even after eating French fries and cola, I would have lost weight?

Yes, that's right.

Eating food that is 500 kcal.

Just because the food is French fries or cola doesn't mean it increases to 600 kcal or 700 kcal.

Calories that haven't been consumed cannot arise within the body.

If you eat food that is 500 kcal.

Even if the food is French fries or cola, the maximum calories absorbed by the body is 500 kcal.

If this maximum calorie intake is the condition for dieting, then you can lose weight even by eating French fries and cola.

The experiment of dieting by only eating McDonald's food is called the McDonald's Diet.

In addition to John Cisna, several other people have tried it.

Among them, there are quite a few cases where people primarily ate hamburgers, French fries, and cola, yet still lost weight.

Does that mean if I only control my calories, I can lose weight no matter what I eat?

Then isn't there no reason to follow a diet plan?

pkang also said to change the types of food you eat to unrefined foods.

It means that there was no need for that.

First of all, if you control your calorie intake, you can lose weight regardless of what you eat.

Nevertheless, there are two main reasons for suggesting a change in the types of food you eat.

The first reason is sustainability.

You can lose weight by controlling the calories of whatever food you eat.

This is not a new story.

It is a story that was already well-known.

It's a method that you instinctively know, even without any knowledge about dieting.

In fact, the most common dieting method that most people try first is reducing calories.

However, the majority fail.

Because there is a desire to eat more food.

The reason for becoming obese is that one consumes a lot of food and a lot of calories.

It’s not that I became obese by forcing myself to eat foods I didn’t want to eat.

I became obese because I ate what I wanted to eat.

So, a person who is obese...

Having a desire to eat enough calories to the point of becoming obese means that...

In such a situation, if you reduce your calorie intake enough to lose weight,

You will find yourself in a situation where you have to resist the desire to eat more with willpower.

When I reach my limit from holding back, I give up on my diet and eat as I used to, and then I gain weight again.

You can lose weight by controlling your calorie intake, no matter what you eat, but...

It's difficult to maintain that state.

The reason this happens is due to the type of food we eat.

The food we eat affects the hormonal metabolism in our bodies.

As a result of this influence, if hormone metabolism changes, there will also be changes in appetite.

Simply put, if you eat foods that increase your appetite,

Due to increased appetite, I find myself wanting to eat a lot of food.

In this situation, it's difficult to endure without eating a lot in order to control calories.

Because human will has its limits.

However, if you change the foods you eat to those that do not increase your appetite,

Increased appetite returns to normal.

When appetite returns to normal, there is simply no desire to eat a lot.

You won't have to hold back on what you want to eat.

Then, you can naturally lose weight and maintain that state.

The second reason is that the amount absorbed by the body varies.

When I ate 500 kcal of food earlier.

I said that just because the food is French fries or cola, it can't increase to 600 kcal or 700 kcal.

Calories that haven't been consumed cannot arise within the body.

However, when you eat food that is 500 kcal,

The calories absorbed by the body decrease to 400 kcal and 300 kcal.

The rest can just be discharged.

In the first place, a person cannot absorb 100% of the calories from the food they eat.

The amount absorbed by the body varies depending on the type of food consumed.

So if you change the types of food you eat,

Even if you eat foods with more calories,

In reality, the amount absorbed by the body is small, so it can lead to weight loss.

This is why it is suggested to change the types of food you eat.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First, no matter what food you eat, if you eat according to the calories suitable for your diet, you will lose weight.

This is not new information; it is information that everyone already knows.

It is the diet method that most people try first and fail at.

The second reason we become obese is that we eat a lot of food.

The reason for eating a lot of food is that there is a strong desire to eat more.

If you try to lower your calorie intake while keeping this appetite the same,

There are situations where I have to resist my desire to eat with willpower.

Because a person's will has its limits, one cannot endure forever.

The third thing is that the food we eat affects our bodies and can also change our appetite.

Changing the types of food you eat can help normalize your strong desire to eat.

When appetite is normalized, one can feel satisfied without eating a lot.

When dieting, it is advisable to change the types of food you eat.

I can organize it like this.

The amount absorbed by the body varies depending on the type of food consumed.

So you said that it's possible to diet even if you eat a lot of calories.

Please explain that part in more detail.

If you eat the same amount of calories as before,

I received a question asking whether there is really any difference between eating healthy food and high-calorie food, so I made a video about it.

I talked about it in detail in that video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

So, you mean we need to change the types of food we eat to normalize our appetite and also reduce the amount absorbed, right?

But why does appetite change depending on the type of food we eat?

And how should I change the types of food I eat?

I previously explained the principles of dieting and talked about that in detail.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the upper right.

In the past, there was talk that diet cola was good for dieting.

Recently, I've heard that it's not the case.

What do you think about diet cola?

I received a similar question in the past and made a video about it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

Is there a way to resolve the compensation psychology?

I was doing well on my diet, but I keep failing because of my reward mentality.

I received a story with the same content and also made a video about the compensation psychology.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right corner.
