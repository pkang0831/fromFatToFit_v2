The first thing to do when you binge eat while on a diet.

Hello, this is pkang.

A question about binge eating during dieting has been posted in the comments.

I went on a diet, but after binge eating, I gained 4.3 kg in just two days.

It is said that you reduced carbohydrates and exercised for more than 4 hours a day to restore your original weight.

However, even after binge eating, recovery happens like this, so it seems that binge eating has become a habit for you.

I am repeating a cycle of 3 days of dieting, one day of binge eating, and 2 days of recovery.

When you gain weight from overeating, is it right to recover quickly?

You asked whether it's better to maintain the original pace as it is.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

First of all, the reason why it is possible to gain weight in a short period due to binge eating and then lose it again is

This is because most of that weight is water.

Body fat doesn't increase quickly in the first place, nor does it decrease quickly.

The foods consumed during binge eating while on a diet are mainly processed and refined foods.

Processed foods are mostly high in carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates have the effect of increasing body water.

So, when you eat a lot of carbohydrates, your body water increases.

The weight increases by the amount of water weight gained.

You might think, how much could the weight of body water really be?

As mentioned in the question, it is possible to fluctuate around 4 to 5 kg.

In the case of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet that actually restricts carbohydrate intake,

In the early stages of starting a diet, there is a characteristic of rapid weight loss.

Because of this characteristic, there are many people who prefer it.

Most of the weight lost initially is water.

In severe cases, some people lose more than 10 kg in just the first month.

So, does that mean it's okay to binge eat? It's just that body water increases, not body fat, right?

Of course, that's not the case.

Most of the increasing weight is body water, but not everything is water.

Because I eat a lot of processed foods, my body fat tends to increase even slightly.

"And it's okay to binge eat. 'Since it's just water, I can lose it quickly anyway.'"

Such thoughts can lower the resistance to binge eating, making it easier to engage in binge eating.

In the case of the person who actually wrote the comment,

You mentioned that you habitually follow a 3-day diet, binge eat for a day, and then recover for 2 days.

If even a small amount of body fat continues to accumulate, it will eventually lead to a significant amount of body fat.

Once a habit of binge eating develops, it is not easy to fix it.

Moreover, if the amount of food intake fluctuates like this, it is obviously not good for your health.

So, it is obviously better not to binge eat than to binge eat.

The content asked in the question is

Should I urgently try to lose the weight I quickly gained after binge eating?

You asked whether it should be reduced slowly or not.

What you need to do after binge eating is not to lose that weight.

Since the moisture has increased anyway, it will dissipate over time.

The first thing you should do after binge eating is to identify the cause of the binge eating.

If you just return your weight to what it was without finding and addressing the cause of binge eating,

The cause remains the same, so binge eating happens again and weight increases.

The person who asked the question is actually binge eating repeatedly.

There are various reasons why people binge eat while on a diet.

The most representative cause among them is the deficiency of specific nutrients.

I talked about this part in detail in the satiety series I created not long ago.

When there is a deficiency in the intake of certain nutrients, a feeling of hunger arises, making you want to eat.

If you try to fill this feeling of hunger in other ways,

A strange phenomenon occurs where you feel full but still want to eat.

For example, if you follow a diet that severely restricts carbohydrate intake,

The desire for carbohydrates is gradually increasing.

The cause is a deficiency of carbohydrates.

Eating a lot of fat and protein does not solve the problem.

Rather, the problem becomes more serious, leading to an increased craving for carbohydrates.

In cases where carbohydrate intake is severely restricted and a diet consists of a lot of meat,

When following a diet for a long time, people often find that meat gradually becomes tasteless and greasy, leading to a feeling of being fed up with it.

In a word, the meat tastes bland.

On the contrary, the craving for carbohydrates increases, making them feel incredibly delicious.

This is one of the causes that lead to binge eating.

To make it easier to understand, let me give you an example.

A person who usually eats a lot of sweet snacks

I don't feel that rice or sweet potatoes are that delicious.

However, if you follow a diet that restricts carbohydrate intake and then eat rice or sweet potatoes,

There is truly nothing in the world that tastes as good as that.

So that's why binge eating happens.

The solution is simple.

It's best not to follow a diet that restricts specific nutrients too much.

Of course, consuming too much of certain nutrients can lead to obesity.

It is correct that it needs to be reduced to an appropriate level.

It means that if you eat insufficiently, it will become a problem.

How much should I eat to be appropriate?

This varies from person to person, so it's difficult to say exactly how much one should eat.

Each person has different amounts of body fat and muscle, varying levels of activity and exercise, and different lifestyle patterns.

What is insufficient for one person can be sufficient for another.

What is enough for one person may be too much for another.

So, does that mean nobody knows how much one should eat?

But how exactly am I supposed to eat moderately??

I know one person.

It's 바로 you.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video,

When a certain nutrient is lacking, the desire for that nutrient increases.

And this increased desire can make one lose interest in their existing diet or

Some foods that are rich in certain nutrients feel particularly delicious or

It makes me binge eat beyond my will.

So, I'm on a diet plan.

As the diet becomes less appealing and the desire for certain nutrients increases,

That means there is a problem with the diet, so I am asking for it to be corrected.

It's the story of my body that knows most accurately what nutrients I need and in what amounts.

If you ignore this issue and continue to stick to the same diet, the problem of binge eating will arise.

For reference, in the case of someone who is really following a proper diet,

Even when eating the processed foods I used to eat, I often feel less satisfied.

It's because there are no lacking nutrients.

In fact, among the comments on my video,

I had pizza for the first time in a while.

It wasn't as tasty as I expected, so I only ate one piece and stopped.

There are quite a few comments saying that the snacks are too sweet to eat.

However, there is a high demand for that nutrient because it is lacking.

If you find that food containing that nutrient tastes much better,

It's only natural to binge eat when consuming processed foods.

When talking about diet, it's something I always mention.

By reducing the intake of processed foods, normalize the body's signaling system.

After that, I need to listen to what my body is telling me to avoid any problems.

I love listening to what my body is telling me and having a conversation with it.
