People in their 20s can also gain age-related weight - Age-related weight loss Part 1

I received a request to provide information about age-related weight gain.

In this video, I would like to talk about age-related weight gain.

As a person's body ages, it tends to gain weight more easily.

This characteristic is why we call the fat that accumulates with age "age-related fat."

Looking at the audience demographic of my videos, the largest group is in their mid-20s to mid-30s.

Generally, people in this age group often think that they don't have to worry about gaining weight due to age because they are still young.

However, theoretically, you can start gaining weight in your late 20s.

So, the concept of "age-related weight gain" actually exists?

But why do people tend to gain weight as they get older?

The fundamental reason is that it is advantageous for survival.

Not long ago, I made a video discussing diet and evolution.

Evolution is not about individuals changing to fit their environment.

It was said that only the individuals suitable for that environment selectively survive.

In the past, humanity often struggled to find food, which led to many instances of hunger.

To resist such hunger, it was necessary to be able to store some of the food consumed as body fat.

Entities that did not possess such abilities all died because they could not withstand hunger.

On the contrary, entities with such abilities survived by enduring hunger.

We are not the individuals that died from starvation, but rather the descendants of those who survived without dying from hunger.

It has the ability to store food as body fat.

So when you eat food, body fat accumulates.

If you eat too much food, excess body fat accumulates, leading to obesity.

Age-related weight gain is similar to this.

During the time when food was obtained through hunting and gathering, physical abilities were quite important.

However, elderly populations like grandfathers and grandmothers experience a decline in physical abilities due to aging.

So, we cannot obtain food through hunting and gathering.

So, it's not that I can't obtain food, but rather that I only consume food.

The larger the elderly population, the more advantageous it was for the survival of the tribe.

There are many people who consume without being able to procure food. How is that more advantageous for survival?

It was possible to take care of the descendants.

A considerable number of organisms are able to be active immediately after birth.

However, in the case of humans, it's not like that. We definitely need the care of other tribes.

The elderly population is unable to hunt and gather, but they are capable of taking care of children.

In the process, it was possible to pass on one's hunting and gathering experiences to their descendants.

The descendants who absorbed that experience became better at hunting and gathering.

So it was more advantageous for survival.

The theory that having a large elderly population is advantageous for the survival of the tribe is called the grandmother theory.

However, if the elderly population consumes too much food, it could actually have a negative effect.

So, for the elderly population, it was important to survive for a long time on a small amount of food.

In short, the longer the lifespan of the elderly population, the more weight they tend to gain, which has been advantageous for survival.

As mentioned earlier,

It is advantageous for survival in that way, and we are the descendants of the tribe that remained until the end.

We also gain weight as we age.

There has actually been an experiment that lasted for 13 years.

After observing 54 randomly selected adipocytes each year,

As we age, the rate at which fat is removed from adipose cells slows down.

On the contrary, the rate at which fat accumulates in fat cells has increased.

As we age, we tend to store as much body fat as possible and use it as sparingly as we can.

I understand that as we age and experience aging, we gain weight associated with getting older.

What does it mean when it says that people in their 20s gain weight?

In Korea, when people refer to those in their 20s and 30s, there is a strong perception that they are young.

One reason for that perception is high educational attainment.

In Korea, in most cases, students go on to attend a four-year university.

In that case, the time when you first enter society after graduating from school is in your mid-twenties.

There is a perception that students who study are young.

Until the early twenties when studying at university, one is perceived as young.

Because those in their early 20s are perceived as young, there is a strong impression that those in their mid-20s to early 30s are also young.

People are considered to be getting older once they reach their mid-30s.

One can clearly feel this change in perception when it comes to the age of marriage.

In the 1980s, when the college enrollment rate was not high, the average age of first marriage was 26.4 years for men and 23 years for women.

However, nowadays, if someone gets married in their early twenties, it feels like they are getting married at a very young age.

The problem is that the timing of gaining weight as you age is unrelated to this perception.

In most countries, 20 years old is considered adulthood because physical growth is complete by that age.

In reality, the growth hormone that helps with physical growth gradually decreases starting in the mid-20s.

However, this growth hormone has the effect of preventing weight gain.

When growth hormone decreases, there is a problem of becoming more prone to gaining weight.

As we age, growth hormone decreases, and because growth hormone decreases, it becomes easier to gain weight.

It seems like you're talking about age-related weight gain, right?

So theoretically, it is possible to gain weight in your late 20s due to a decrease in growth hormone.

And people who have eating and lifestyle habits that reduce growth hormone

Even in your early 20s or as a teenager, there can be issues with gaining weight due to age.

Being in your teens or early twenties is not considered old.

The fact that weight gain occurs due to a decrease in growth hormone is similar to the mechanism of age-related weight gain.

So, growth hormone is important after all?

What does growth hormone do? Why does weight gain occur when growth hormone decreases?

In the next video, we will discuss growth hormones in detail.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the weight loss diet.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
