Hello, this is pkang.

The most certain way to succeed in dieting is to not give up on the diet.

However, while everyone hopes for success in dieting, many often give up along the way.

Because there are traps that make you give up on your diet.

In this video, I will talk about this trap.

In the early stages of starting a diet, it isn't very difficult.

I want to go on a diet! Let's do it! I have a strong motivation for this.

Since I just started my diet and exercise recently, it's not boring or difficult yet.

In the early stages of dieting, there is a phenomenon where weight decreases rapidly.

Because of this, dieting isn't that difficult, but is my weight really decreasing well?

Is it possible to go on a diet? It seems like the diet will be over soon?

I start to have such thoughts.

However, as time passes, the situation gradually changes.

My motivation for dieting is gradually decreasing.

The diet and exercise are gradually becoming boring and difficult.

People have a psychological tendency to expect greater rewards the harder the work becomes.

Since dieting has become boring and difficult, I start to hope that my weight will drop more quickly.

However, the rate of weight loss is only fast in the early stages of the diet.

After some time, the rate at which weight decreases gradually slows down.

Dieting has become more difficult, but the reward of losing weight has actually weakened.

Feelings of unfairness and frustration arise, and these emotions lead to giving up on dieting.

Why is it that in the early stages of dieting, it isn't difficult, but weight drops quickly?

There are many diet methods in the world.

No matter which diet method you choose, there are two phenomena that are sure to occur.

This means that the intake of carbohydrates and sodium is reduced.

I don't follow a low-carb diet or a low-sodium diet. I eat plenty of carbohydrates and sodium, you know?

Carbohydrates and sodium have the effect of increasing appetite.

From the seller's perspective, frequent purchases of food by consumers are necessary to increase profits.

Foods high in carbohydrates and sodium are those that guarantee benefits.

So the processed refined foods that are made for sale are

It contains a lot of carbohydrates and sodium.

There are many different methods for dieting, but

What is essential in every diet is

It suggests reducing the intake of processed refined foods.

Even if you don't follow a low-sodium or low-carbohydrate diet, just reducing the intake of refined foods will be enough.

The excessive amounts of carbohydrates and sodium that were consumed will be reduced to a moderate level.

This causes rapid weight loss in the early stages of dieting.

Sodium in our body must always maintain a constant concentration.

When sodium intake increases, the amount of body water increases to balance the concentration.

When sodium intake decreases, the amount of body fluid reduces, which adjusts the concentration.

So when sodium intake decreases, body weight decreases by the amount of body water that is lost.

Carbohydrates are similar as well.

Carbohydrates serve as the building blocks for glycogen, which is stored in the muscles.

Glycogen has the characteristic of being stored along with water.

When carbohydrate intake decreases, the storage of glycogen decreases.

As the water stored with glycogen is released, body weight decreases accordingly.

I will summarize.

The reason weight drops easily in the early stages of a diet is that body water is lost.

After sufficient water loss, weight will decrease slowly.

This is a completely normal phenomenon that occurs regardless of the diet method used.

The weight is dropping more slowly compared to the beginning of the diet.

You don't need to feel anxious or impatient about whether there is a problem with your diet method.

Body water can increase by 1kg or 2kg in a day if you consume a lot of carbohydrates and sodium.

When you have a cheat day, it's possible to gain 1kg in just one day.

It is not an increase in body fat, but rather an increase in water.

If you reduce your intake of carbohydrates and sodium, you will lose weight quickly.

There's no need to feel frustrated or give up just because you gained weight after a cheat day.

On the contrary, if you fall into the trap of body water retention,

In the early stages of the diet, I was losing weight quickly, but now I'm feeling anxious about why it's slowing down.

Should I try eating less? I start to wonder, "Should I make my workouts harder?"

Such anxiety and worries are stressful in themselves, but

Even if you eat less food and exercise harder,

Since body water has already been lost, weight loss will not occur as it did in the initial stages of the diet.

However, it was difficult to change my diet.

The compensation psychology is triggered, and the stress becomes even worse.

To relieve stress, I thought about having a cheat day just for one day, so I did.

No matter how hard I tried, I saw my weight increase by 1kg or 2kg in just one day.

As frustration and despair build up, the likelihood of giving up on dieting increases.

If you are planning to diet now or if you are currently on a diet,

You need to be careful not to fall into the trap of body water, so you can successfully diet.

Sounds plausible, right?
