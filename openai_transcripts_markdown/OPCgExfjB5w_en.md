Two ways to reduce visceral fat that causes a protruding belly - Part 2 of losing belly fat.

I recently made a video about losing belly fat, and the response has been quite positive.

I am considering creating a series specifically about losing belly fat.

In the last video, I provided a comprehensive explanation of what belly fat is and how to lose it.

Most of the content was about lower belly fat, specifically regarding subcutaneous fat.

In this video, I would like to talk about visceral fat.

I mentioned it in the first part of the video as well.

Visceral fat is located right next to the organs, which makes it easy to use as energy.

So if you live with poor eating habits, it's easy to gain body fat.

On the contrary, improving your eating habits can make it easier to lose body fat.

When it comes to improving eating habits, there are two main factors that are important.

The first is to distinguish between meal times and fasting times.

In the past, humanity needed a lot of preparation to obtain food.

We had to prepare food ingredients through hunting and gathering.

The ingredients had to be cooked again before they could be eaten.

So there was a distinction between the time for eating food and the fasting period when food was not consumed.

However, in modern society, this distinction is disappearing.

You can easily obtain food anytime and anywhere, and once you get the food, you can eat it right away.

It's so easy to get food.

I have eaten enough food and don't need any more, but I still eat.

Such eating habits are problematic.

It seems to be talking about having fasting periods in intermittent fasting.

Before intermittent fasting became popular, there was also the diet of eating small amounts frequently.

Is it really a problem if someone eats food often?

Eating small amounts frequently can be helpful for dieting, but...

This method involves eating frequently, but...

The amount of food eaten at one time is small or the calories are low.

As the saying goes, I eat it often but in small amounts.

On the other hand, eating food too frequently means that

It refers to frequently eating foods that are high in calories and abundant.

For example, if you have eaten a sufficient amount of food and are full.

There are times when we drink sweet coffee for dessert.

Sweet coffee is a liquid, so you can drink it even when you're full.

It is a beverage with a significantly high calorie content.

From the body's perspective, having another meal is essentially the same thing.

And in between meals, I sometimes have snacks like cookies or cake.

This also has a small volume but is quite high in calories.

So, while having a sufficient amount of meals,

The problem is eating drinks and snacks that are no different from meals in between meals.

Dividing food into smaller portions is not a problem in itself.

The quality of the food we eat is different, and what our bodies absorb is also different.

The method of eating small meals frequently from the beginning is designed to prevent the intake of such beverages and snacks.

If you don't have a proper meal, you will feel very hungry.

When hunger intensifies, it leads to overeating due to a reward psychology.

Even if I'm not hungry, I eat a little bit regularly and often.

You are trying to prevent overeating caused by hunger.

This method is often used when treating binge eating disorder.

So before intermittent fasting became popular,

If you skip breakfast, you'll end up overeating at lunch due to a compensation mentality.

There is a saying that you must eat breakfast if you want to diet.

So, intermittent fasting prevents the intake of unnecessary food through the fasting period.

Eating small amounts frequently helps to prevent hunger and reduces unnecessary food intake.

Although the methods are different, both aim to prevent the intake of unnecessary food.

So both methods are effective for dieting.

It is because the purpose itself is the same.

Therefore, you can choose the method that suits you best from the two options.

Having fasting periods is convenient.

In that case, you can choose a method to have fasting periods.

Having a fasting period leads to overeating due to hunger.

People like this can choose to portion their food and eat small amounts frequently.

However, it is said that when you eat food, insulin is released, and this is not good for dieting.

Can intermittent fasting with a 16-hour fasting period be similar to eating small amounts frequently?

Yes, it is definitely possible.

I talked about the reasons in detail in the intermittent fasting series.

Right now, the intermittent fasting series link is being shared at the top right.

For those who are curious about the details, you can click to see more.

The second important aspect of improving eating habits is to create a diet that suits me.

Many people follow a diet plan and work hard to lose weight, but then...

I gain weight again by eating the foods I used to eat, and then I start dieting again.

The reason is that it is not a diet that suits them.

In the next video, I will talk about how to create a diet that suits me.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the belly fat reduction series,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video.

Thank you.
