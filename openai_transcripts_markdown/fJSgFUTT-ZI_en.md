Is it effective to have liposuction and then diet?

There was a comment asking whether dieting after liposuction is effective.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

Liposuction itself reduces body fat.

Dieting without undergoing liposuction and

Comparing liposuction and dieting.

Of course, undergoing liposuction and dieting will lead to a quicker reduction in body fat.

This is an obvious statement.

So it seems that this is not what I was asking about.

I think it's probably a question about the number of fat cells.

When body fat accumulates in our bodies, two types of processes occur in fat cells.

The first is the proliferation of fat cells, which increases their number.

The second is the enlargement of fat cells, known as hypertrophy.

In the past, when body fat increased, I conducted an experiment to observe what happens to fat cells.

In the case of minors whose bodies are growing, the number of fat cells has increased.

In the case of adults whose physical growth has ended, it has been found that the size of fat cells increases.

Having a large number of fat cells means that there are many fat cells that can grow in size.

In other words, it means having a body type that easily gains weight.

So, whether one is obese or not in childhood determines their tendency to gain weight.

After becoming an adult, the number of fat cells does not change.

It will be said that this constitution cannot be changed.

Because of this story, many people became interested in liposuction for a while.

Liposuction directly removes fat, which effectively reduces the number of fat cells.

If there is no change in the number of fat cells in adults next time.

I thought that once I had liposuction, the fat cells would never increase again.

So it seems you are asking whether it is better to diet after having liposuction.

It depends on the situation, but I wouldn't really recommend it.

First of all, it's not that the number of fat cells in adults doesn't change.

There was a question about this before, so I made a response video.

Why has it been said that the number of fat cells in adults does not change?

And for those who are curious about why that story has changed now,

In reviews of liposuction, I've heard that the areas where fat was removed tend to gain less weight. Is that true?

Yes, that's right.

If fat cells are artificially removed through liposuction,

It takes time for fat cells to increase again.

Even if you gain weight, the areas where liposuction was performed tend to gain less fat.

However, after some time, if the fat cells increase sufficiently again, it is possible to gain weight back.

And the important thing is that fat accumulates more severely in other areas.

If you take a closer look at the reviews of liposuction,

It is said that the areas where liposuction is performed definitely gain less fat.

There is a story that instead, other areas become excessively fat.

The original cause of obesity is not due to the number of fat cells being high, but rather...

It is due to poor eating and lifestyle habits, and only by correcting these can you achieve weight loss.

If you only try liposuction without fixing this, your body fat will increase again.

If there is no space where liposuction has been done, it will shift to other areas.

I'm not saying I won't control my diet. I can just have liposuction and then manage my diet.

I talked about it in the subcutaneous fat series.

A diet plan is an effective way to reduce visceral fat, but

It is not an effective method for reducing subcutaneous fat.

For reference, women often have a higher prevalence of subcutaneous fat obesity.

Most people try to diet by either starving themselves or eating very little.

This is why my diet isn't going well.

That's why it's said that a woman's diet never ends.

The subcutaneous fat series is currently linked at the top right.

What is subcutaneous fat?

Why does subcutaneous fat accumulate?

How can I effectively reduce subcutaneous fat?

I will summarize.

If you feel pain due to an arm injury,

You don't need to take painkillers to reduce pain.

I need to treat my arm.

The cause of the problem is that I injured my arm.

Of course, while the painkiller is effective, the pain decreases.

As time passes and the effectiveness of the medication decreases, the pain is felt again.

Similarly, if body fat has increased due to poor eating and lifestyle habits,

You should not reduce body fat through liposuction, but rather improve your eating and lifestyle habits.

The area may gain less fat until the number of fat cells increases again.

As time passes, if the number of fat cells increases again, it will ultimately lead to weight gain once more.

Improving eating habits and lifestyle habits that contribute to obesity is the most important thing.

Then, if you understand the correct dieting methods and change your eating habits and lifestyle,

Is it okay to have liposuction?

Yes, that's right.

In this case, it would be enough to just go on a diet to reduce body fat.

There is no particular reason to undergo liposuction.

If there is a special reason and you really want to receive it,

Please make your choice after fully understanding the costs and risks through consultation.
