Does taking psyllium husk powder before meals help with weight loss?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

In a recent video, I talked about the ramen experiment.

When we eat food, our blood sugar levels rise.

When blood sugar levels rise, a hormone called insulin is released to lower that blood sugar.

Insulin lowers blood sugar levels, but it can also increase body fat.

If blood sugar levels rise significantly and a lot of insulin is released, it can lead to obesity.

So, eating foods that significantly raise blood sugar is one of the causes of obesity.

However, eating vegetables along with food helps prevent a rise in blood sugar levels.

When comparing the times when I only ate ramen and when I ate ramen with vegetables,

When eating ramen with vegetables, you can see that blood sugar levels rise much less.

So, when you eat food, eating vegetables along with it means that you will gain less weight or it will help with dieting.

There are several reasons why this phenomenon occurs.

The most representative reason is the dietary fiber in vegetables.

The dietary fiber in vegetables hinders the digestion and absorption of ramen, which results in a lower increase in blood sugar levels.

Based on the content up to this point

There was a question about whether taking psyllium husk powder before a meal would yield the same effect.

Psyllium husk powder also contains a lot of dietary fiber, so does it have the same effect?

To put it simply...

When consuming psyllium husk powder, it does not produce the same effects as eating vegetables.

Because the effects of eating vegetables are not just due to dietary fiber alone.

When I said the amount of food I put in my mouth at one time is 10,

In the case of only eating ramen, you would put 10 units of ramen in your mouth each time.

The only food I can put in my mouth is ramen.

However, in the case of eating vegetables and ramen together, you cannot fully satisfy that 10 with ramen alone.

You need to eat vegetables as well.

So, compared to when you just eat ramen, the amount of ramen you eat at once decreases.

And there will be a difference in the number of times you chew.

When eating ramen, the number of times you chew is not very high.

However, when you eat vegetables with ramen, the number of times you chew increases because of the vegetables.

If the amount of ramen put in the mouth at once decreases and the number of chews increases,

You naturally start to eat food slowly.

This has a significant impact on dieting.

I mentioned it in the video about the principles of dieting.

There are two conditions that foods must meet to make us obese.

The first is that food contains a lot of nutrients.

The second point is that digestion and absorption will be quick.

Both of these conditions are met simultaneously.

When a large amount of nutrients enters the body in a short period of time, it can lead to obesity.

Let's talk in terms of blood sugar levels.

If you consume a lot of carbohydrates in a short period of time and those carbohydrates are quickly digested and absorbed,

This is what causes a rapid increase in blood sugar levels.

In other words,

Even if you consume the same amount of carbohydrates, if you eat slowly and the carbohydrates are digested and absorbed slowly,

That means blood sugar rises slowly.

The method of consuming psyllium husk powder before meals can provide dietary fiber, but...

It does not have the effect of slowing down the speed of eating itself.

It does not have the same effect as vegetables.

So, if you take psyllium husk powder and eat slowly, can you achieve the same effect?

No, that's not the case.

Because I want to put a lot of food in my mouth and chew.

If you say not to do that and to add a little bit at a time, it gets annoying.

It's already chewed up and about to go down my throat, so forcing myself to chew more would be uncomfortable.

If you have to constantly pay attention to this every time you eat, it becomes a very big source of stress.

As mentioned in the stress series, stress can also increase body fat.

Forcing a change in eating habits is not a very effective method.

So I ate comfortably.

Eating slowly and naturally because of vegetables can have a dieting effect, but...

If I try to force myself to eat slowly, it can have the opposite effect due to the stress.

And the diet effect of vegetables is not just about raising blood sugar slowly.

Eating vegetables creates a feeling of fullness due to their volume.

This has the effect of reducing meal portions.

As mentioned in the salt video, sodium has the issue of increasing appetite.

The potassium in vegetables helps to expel sodium, which can also reduce appetite.

Nothing works, and that doesn't work either. So what on earth am I supposed to do?

You can eat vegetables.

The diet effects mentioned in the video can all be achieved by eating vegetables.

It is explaining the weight loss effects that occur when eating vegetables in the first place.

However, when I try to find other ways without eating vegetables,

I have to do this, and I have to do that, and it just gets complicated like that.

I hope you don't make simple tasks unnecessarily complicated.

You can just eat vegetables.

When I talk about dieting, I always say to change the types of food you eat.

Just like how eating vegetables brings about various effects.

Changing the types of food you eat can lead to a tremendous number of effects.

The combination of those effects makes it easier to lose weight.

So you can lose weight without eating less or starving yourself.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make a video explaining how to change the type of food in the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

Earlier, when we were talking about stress, you mentioned that stress can lead to an increase in body fat.

Isn't it true that some people lose weight when they are stressed?

Some people lose weight when they are stressed.

Some people gain weight when they are stressed.

Why is this happening?

I talked about it in detail in the stress video series I created before.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

You mentioned that eating a lot of salt increases appetite.

Why does eating a lot of salt increase appetite?

I also made a video about that in the past.

I will make sure to have salt-related videos appear in the bottom left.

You can choose and watch the video that you are curious about among the three videos.
