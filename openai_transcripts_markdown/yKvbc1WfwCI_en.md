Hello, this is pkang.

A question came up in the comments asking what I think about doing cardio on an empty stomach.

This is the third video about aerobic and anaerobic exercise.

If you haven't watched the previous two videos, you may not understand the content or could misunderstand it.

If you haven't watched the previous video, please click the link in the top right to view it.

Some people say that doing cardio on an empty stomach is effective, while others say it is not.

I will discuss why these differences in opinion arise.

First, let's clarify the definition of fasted cardio.

In fasting cardio, some people mistakenly interpret fasting simply as having an empty stomach.

The fasting referred to here does not simply mean that the stomach is empty.

It is not very good to exercise when there is food in your stomach after a meal.

Exercise can sometimes interfere with digestion and absorption.

Because I feel bloated and uncomfortable, my exercise efficiency decreases.

So, after 2 to 3 hours have passed since the meal, I exercise after the food has been digested in the stomach.

Since there is no food above, it can be said that I am hungry.

The exercise done at this time is not fasted cardio.

The reason why fasted cardio is effective for fat loss is that

If you go a long time without eating, the amount of carbohydrates stored in your body decreases.

When you exercise with a low amount of stored carbohydrates in your body,

It is based on the theory that because there is a lack of carbohydrates, the body will use more body fat.

So, in the context of fasted cardio, being in a fasted state is not just about having an empty stomach.

It refers to the state in which the amount of carbohydrates stored in the body is at its lowest.

It refers to exercising after the longest period of not eating during the day.

The longest period of time during the day without eating is at night, including sleep time.

Waking up in the morning and exercising without having a meal is called fasted cardio.

First, let's talk about situations where fasted cardio is not effective.

As mentioned in Part 1 of the video series on aerobic and anaerobic exercise,

Cardio exercise refers to low-intensity exercise.

So, fasting cardio refers to low-intensity exercise done on an empty stomach.

As mentioned in the second part of the video, when comparing low-intensity exercise and high-intensity exercise,

Low-intensity exercise has a higher proportion of fat usage, but the actual amount of fat used is lower.

The afterburn effect, which continues to burn body fat even after exercise, is also relatively weak.

High-intensity exercise is better for burning body fat than low-intensity exercise.

So rather than doing low-intensity exercise on an empty stomach,

Having a meal and then doing high-intensity exercise is more effective for burning body fat.

Then wouldn't it be better to do high-intensity exercise on an empty stomach? (voice modulation)

Yes, that's right.

However, as mentioned in the first part of the video, when exercising, the body first uses carbohydrates for energy.

Gradually increasing the usage of body fat, we are swapping the usage of carbohydrates and body fat.

If there are low levels of carbohydrates stored in the body, there won't be enough energy to start high-intensity exercise.

Most people cannot perform high-intensity exercise on an empty stomach.

I actually tried to do cardio exercise on an empty stomach, but...

This applies to those who say they can't do it because they lack strength.

Considering all of this, it seems that fasted cardio should not be effective.

However, there are often cases where people have seen results from doing cardio exercises on an empty stomach.

Why is that?

There are cases where people have seen results from doing cardio exercises on an empty stomach.

This is a case of performing high-intensity exercise on an empty stomach, not low-intensity exercise.

They say that even if you try to do high-intensity exercise on an empty stomach, you can't because there aren't enough carbohydrates.

Yes, that's right. Usually, a regular person can't do that.

However, in the case of a person with a lot of muscle mass,

Because there is a lot of muscle mass, there is also a large amount of carbohydrate storage.

When there is a high amount of carbohydrate storage, even after the longest fasting period of the day,

There are cases where carbohydrates are not depleted and remain.

Because carbohydrates are still present, it is possible to perform high-intensity exercise.

Because it is high-intensity exercise, there is a significant amount of actual fat burning, and there is also an afterburn effect.

Up to this point, there is no difference between fasted high-intensity exercise and regular high-intensity exercise.

The next part is interesting.

A person with a lot of muscle mass has a high capacity for storing carbohydrates.

Because there is a large amount of carbohydrate storage, the usage of body fat increases slowly.

For example, if the energy expended through exercise is 100 and the storage amount of carbohydrates is 150, then...

Due to the lack of carbohydrates, the usage of body fat increases rapidly.

However, if the energy expended through exercise is 100 and the storage amount of carbohydrates is 300,

There is an abundance of carbohydrates, so the usage of body fat gradually increases.

Does that mean that the bigger the muscles get, the harder it is to diet? (voice modulation)

If the muscles have developed but the same exercise is continued, it can be said that.

So, when muscles develop, you can increase the intensity of your workouts or extend the duration of your exercise.

We solve the problem by increasing the amount of carbohydrates consumed through exercise.

If the energy expended through exercise increases to 200, even if the carbohydrate storage is 300,

Because there is no surplus of carbohydrates, the usage of body fat increases rapidly.

However, if you continue to repeat the same exercise without increasing the intensity or duration,

The effects of the diet gradually diminish.

In the case of a diet where you walk to school or work.

Since I walk the same distance every time, the intensity of my exercise is fixed.

At first, there is an effect of reducing body fat, but

As the duration of exercise increases and muscles develop, the effects become weaker.

Let's return to high-intensity exercise on an empty stomach.

During the longest fasting period of the day, when carbohydrate storage levels decrease,

Because the amount of stored carbohydrates is low, the usage of body fat increases rapidly.

So even if you exercise less than you originally did, a similar amount of body fat can still be burned.

If you force yourself to maintain the same amount of exercise, more body fat will be burned.

So, high-intensity exercise on an empty stomach is more effective than just high-intensity exercise.

If this story is true, isn't it better to eat fewer carbohydrates while exercising?

People who exercise seem to think carbohydrates are important...

If you eat fewer carbohydrates, the amount of carbohydrates stored in your body decreases.

If you exercise in this state, the same effect will occur.

However, exercising while intentionally reducing the amount of stored carbohydrates is

There is a problem of muscle loss occurring.

When you exercise with a low amount of stored carbohydrates,

Even if you exercise less than you used to, body fat burns similarly.

As physical activity decreases, muscle loss occurs.

If you forcefully maintain the same amount of exercise, your body will break down muscle to obtain the energy it lacks.

This process leads to muscle loss.

So for someone whose goal is to build muscle,

Rather than intentionally eating fewer carbohydrates or doing high-intensity exercise on an empty stomach,

It is beneficial to consume enough carbohydrates and engage in high-intensity exercise.

I will summarize.

Depending on the person, there are those for whom exercising on an empty stomach is effective and those for whom it is not.

After the longest fasting period of the day, try performing the exercise yourself.

If you don't have the strength to perform high-intensity exercise,

Exercising at high intensity after eating is better for fat loss than working out on an empty stomach.

In this case, there is no need to exercise on an empty stomach.

If you can do high-intensity exercise on an empty stomach, it is more effective for fat loss, but there is a risk of muscle loss.

If you prioritize reducing body fat over muscle mass, then you should engage in high-intensity exercise on an empty stomach.

If increasing muscle mass is more important than reducing body fat, it is better not to do it.

Sounds plausible, right?
