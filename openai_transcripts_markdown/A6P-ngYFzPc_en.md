Belly fat is the first to go vs. Belly fat is the last to go.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

Recently, I made a video explaining how to diet from an average body type to a lean one.

It is often possible to diet healthily while going from obesity to a normal weight.

Many people often think that to lose weight from being average to slim, one must starve.

However, that is not the case, which is the content of the video.

The body fat in a person is largely divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

To diet from average to slim, you need to reduce subcutaneous fat.

However, the method of starving actually hinders the reduction of body fat.

So if you want to diet from being average to slim, you should eat well instead of starving yourself.

However, a question about belly fat came up in the comments on that video.

In this video, I would like to talk about belly fat.

Right now, a video link on how to diet from normal to slim is being shared at the top right.

If you're curious about the content of that video, you can click to watch it.

In a video about how to diet from average to slim.

I mentioned that the visceral fat in the abdomen decreases more quickly than subcutaneous fat in other areas.

In other words, it means that belly fat burns off faster than other types of fat.

However, when you hear the experiences of people who have actually gone on a diet,

Many people have shared that they felt stressed because their belly fat did not come off until the very end.

So I mentioned in the video that belly fat is the first to go.

In the experiences shared by people who have dieted, they say that belly fat is the last to go.

They are saying opposing things.

A question has arisen about which of these two is correct.

To conclude, both statements are correct.

The body fat in a person is largely divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat refers to the fat located next to the internal organs.

Subcutaneous fat refers to the fat located beneath the skin.

The only place in the entire body where the internal organs are located is the abdomen.

Visceral fat is only in the abdomen.

So the fat in areas like the arms, thighs, and back is all subcutaneous fat.

So, is all the fat on the body visceral fat?

No, that's not the case.

The belly has internal organs, so it naturally has visceral fat as well.

The belly has skin too, which is why there is subcutaneous fat.

So, the belly is an area that has both visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

There is subcutaneous fat under the skin.

There are muscles beneath the subcutaneous fat.

There are organs and visceral fat beneath the muscles.

This is something I've mentioned multiple times in other videos.

Visceral fat is located right next to the organs, which makes it easy to convert into energy.

So when you diet, it is fat that burns off faster than subcutaneous fat.

The only place where there is visceral fat in my entire body is my abdomen.

So when you are on a diet, it is true that belly fat is the first to go.

However, there is also subcutaneous fat in the abdomen.

To reduce body fat, you need to increase muscle mass and activity levels through exercise.

The abdominal muscles, which are the muscles of the stomach, are relatively small muscles.

Because the muscles are small, they get tired easily, making it difficult to increase activity levels and exercise amounts.

So the subcutaneous fat on the abdomen takes longer to lose than subcutaneous fat in other areas.

That's why there is still subcutaneous fat left in the abdomen until the end of the diet.

So, the belly is the first place where dieting starts due to visceral fat.

Due to subcutaneous fat, this is the area where dieting ends last.

So it's true that belly fat is the first to go and also the last to go.

You mentioned that visceral fat is lost before subcutaneous fat.

I have thin arms and legs, so I don't have any subcutaneous fat, but my belly sticks out.

What am I?

In reality, it is possible to have low subcutaneous fat while having a high amount of visceral fat.

However, it's more likely that the belly is due to internal organs.

As mentioned earlier,

The human body is structured so that the abdominal muscles, known as the rectus abdominis, support the internal organs and visceral fat.

So if your abs are strong enough,

You can support and compress your internal organs and visceral fat to make yourself look slimmer.

It's like when you wear shapewear that compresses your belly, making you look slimmer.

But what would happen if, on the contrary, the abdominal muscles are too weak?

As the abdominal muscles fail to properly support the internal organs and visceral fat, the abdominal muscles begin to protrude.

My stomach is sticking out.

If your limbs are thin but your belly is protruding, it is likely due to this.

So, is my belly sticking out because of body fat?

Is my belly sticking out because of visceral fat?

Is my belly sticking out because my abdominal muscles are weak?

The reasons for belly fat can vary, so the methods to get rid of it are also different.

How do you distinguish and how do you remove it?

If you touch and press your belly fat, you can easily distinguish it.

First of all, if your belly feels soft when you touch it, it means that you are feeling subcutaneous fat.

Soft belly fat is subcutaneous fat.

This type of subcutaneous belly fat can be lost by eating well and exercising diligently.

On the contrary, if your stomach feels firm when you touch it, that means you are feeling muscle, not fat.

In this case, something inside is pushing the abdominal muscles outward.

It's either the internal organs or the visceral fat that's pushing it out.

The way to distinguish what is pushing out is by looking at the upper abdomen.

If you have a lot of visceral fat and it's pushing outwards,

Just like inflating a balloon, the stomach will swell up overall.

So if both the upper and lower abdomen are protruding, it can be considered visceral fat type belly fat.

As I mentioned earlier, visceral fat can be easily converted into energy.

Focusing on your diet is effective.

Lastly, my abdominal muscles are weak, so they cannot support my internal organs.

Because of that, the belly that sticks out will only have the lower belly protruding without the upper belly.

The fact that the abdominal muscles are not properly supporting the internal organs indicates that there has been significant muscle loss.

If muscle loss has progressed to this extent,

The visceral fat that is easy to use as energy has already been almost completely used up.

Since the abdomen alone cannot push the entire belly, only the lower abdomen will protrude.

In this case, the weakness of the abdominal muscles is the cause, so it is also important to strengthen the abdominal muscles.

It is likely that your basal metabolic rate has decreased significantly due to severe muscle loss.

What should I do to restore my lowered basal metabolic rate?

I'm concerned about my thighs and calves, not my belly fat. What should I do?

Please tell me about back fat and arm fat as well.

In a moment, three videos will appear on the screen.

In the top left, make sure to display a video about upper body obesity, such as arm and back fat.

In the bottom left, make sure to display a video about lower body obesity, such as calves or thighs.

In the upper right corner, I will have a video on how to recover when your basal metabolic rate decreases.

You can choose and watch the videos you need.
