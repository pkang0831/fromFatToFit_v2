If you do this 30 minutes after eating, you can lose 3 kg in a month - Post-meal Exercise Part 1.

An interesting question has been posted in the comments.

I saw a video that said if you walk for about 30 minutes after a meal, you can lose 3 kg in a month.

Is it really possible to lose 3 kg in a month just by walking for 30 minutes?

How is that possible?

First of all, there is an experiment that showed a result of losing 3 kg in a month when walking for about 30 minutes after meals.

So it's not entirely baseless.

The reason this is possible is that walking after a meal has the effect of suppressing blood sugar spikes.

Recently, the main topic in dieting has been discussions about blood sugar and insulin.

To summarize briefly,

When we eat food, our blood sugar levels rise.

When blood sugar levels rise, a hormone called insulin is released to lower this blood sugar.

This insulin has the effect of increasing body fat.

When blood sugar levels rise significantly, a lot of insulin is released, leading to weight gain.

On the contrary, if you prevent your blood sugar from rising too high, it leads to weight loss.

Eating food here raises blood sugar levels.

If you have a period of fasting without eating food, it becomes intermittent fasting.

Since carbohydrates raise blood sugar the most, let's limit carbohydrates!

This is how you create a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Even if insulin is secreted, body fat will not increase if there is no fat to be stored as body fat.

So if we say to limit fat, it becomes a high-carb, low-fat diet.

Walking after a meal is a way to suppress the rise in blood sugar caused by eating.

Energy is needed to move an object.

Of course, a person needs energy to walk.

Walking after a meal uses the glucose in the blood as energy for walking.

When glucose in the blood is used for energy, blood sugar levels decrease.

When blood sugar levels decrease through walking, there is less need for a large amount of insulin to be released to lower blood sugar.

If insulin is not secreted in large amounts, it leads to the effect of weight loss.

How about running or weight training instead of walking after a meal?

Does consuming more energy lead to a greater weight loss effect?

No, that's not the case.

When we eat food, our body focuses on digesting and absorbing that food.

Blood is concentrated in the digestive organs to focus on digestion, and the parasympathetic nervous system is activated.

In simple terms, it means that as you focus on digestion, your activity level decreases.

Because of this, after eating, I don't want to move and sometimes feel sleepy due to food coma.

However, engaging in intense exercise is the opposite of doing this.

Because a lot of muscles need to be used, blood must be directed through the muscles.

You need to activate the sympathetic nervous system that awakens the body.

So, if you engage in intense exercise right after eating, it can interfere with digestion.

In fact, after feeding the rats and then subjecting them to intense exercise, we performed dissections.

As a result, food may not be properly digested and can remain as it is.

So, if you do intense exercise right after eating, digestion will be disrupted.

Since the food is not being digested and remains in the stomach, the secretion of gastric juice increases.

I feel bloated and have a bitter taste rising, which interferes with my exercise.

It's not good for both meals and exercise.

It's something I always say, but interpreting information in an extreme way is not good.

Eating a lot of food makes you gain weight, so...

Just like not eating food and starving is not the best diet,

Walking after meals helps suppress blood sugar spikes and is beneficial for dieting.

Exercising vigorously after a meal does not necessarily lead to a better diet.

It is advisable to stay within appropriate limits.

In reality, I walk for 30 minutes after meals every day in exactly the same way.

Choose one of breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and a group that walks continuously for 30 minutes.

10 minutes after breakfast, 10 minutes after lunch, 10 minutes after dinner.

When comparing a group that walked in 10-minute intervals,

There were results showing that the blood sugar levels of a group that walked in 10-minute intervals were more significantly suppressed.

So, it's important not to just sit still after eating, but to move your body.

If you want to diet but find it difficult to stick to a meal plan and also hard to exercise,

Try taking a walk for 30 minutes after a meal.

You can lose weight just with that alone.
