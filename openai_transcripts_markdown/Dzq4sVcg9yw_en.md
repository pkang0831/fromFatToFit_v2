In my twenties, I didn't gain weight, but now that I'm in my thirties, I've started to gain weight and it's become a concern.

First, let's read the content of the story.

Hello, I'm a woman in my 30s.

I thought I had a body type that didn't gain weight until my twenties.

Until high school, I constantly snacked on foods like chips, tteokbokki, and bread, yet I was slim.

Since I became a college student and started drinking, I gained a little weight, but I wasn't obese.

I love water, so I always wear a swimsuit in the summer.

If you take care of yourself a little before summer arrives, there will be no problem wearing revealing swimsuits.

However, now that I'm in my 30s, I'm gradually gaining weight.

Even with the same management as before, I'm not losing weight.

I haven't been meeting my friends, using being busy as an excuse, because I don't want to show them this side of me.

I registered at the gym for the first time and bought diet meal boxes.

After work, it's really tough to exercise with my tired body.

It feels like I'm going crazy trying to work out so hard and eat diet meals.

How did I end up like this?

If you try to lose weight by starving yourself, your basal metabolic rate decreases, making it easier for you to gain weight.

There are many stories like this.

I'm not like that, you know.

I haven't changed what I eat, and I haven't been on a strict diet either.

Nothing has changed, so I don't understand why this suddenly happened.

Please help me.

This is the story of such content. Let's talk about it in detail.

To summarize the content of the story briefly,

In my twenties, I could eat freely without gaining weight.

Even if I gain weight, I used to be able to lose it quickly with just a little bit of management.

Once I hit my 30s, I found that I easily gain weight and it doesn't come off as easily.

Nothing has changed, so why did it come to this?

This is the question that the person sharing their story is most curious about.

There has been a change.

In your mid-20s, two major changes occur.

The first is the change in the environment.

In Korea, it is common for students to attend university and study until their early twenties.

Once you reach your mid-20s, you graduate from school and start working.

Students have a break between classes.

Because I move around different classrooms, I maintain a certain level of activity.

If it's not during exam period, I don't study all day long either.

After the exam, there is also a break from school.

On the other hand, an office worker goes to work at 9 AM and leaves at 6 PM.

I spend most of the day working.

In office jobs, there is hardly any time to move the body except during meal breaks.

And since I spend most of the day working, I accumulate a lot of fatigue.

Because of this, it's difficult to engage in other activities after work.

This is a problem.

The human body has the characteristic of becoming stronger the more it is used, and weakening when it is not used.

If you move your body a lot and use your muscles a lot, your muscle mass will increase.

On the contrary, if you don't move your body and don't use your muscles, your muscle mass will decrease.

And this is the same for the brain.

One of the things the brain does is to move the body.

The more you move your body, the more stimulation your brain receives, which strengthens its functions.

There are many studies showing that exercising actually leads to brain development and improved brain function.

On the contrary, if you don't move your body, it can cause problems in the brain.

The typical symptoms that appear at this time are stress and feelings of depression.

Since the problem arises from not moving the body, it can be resolved by moving the body.

Since most of the day is spent working, there is a lack of time to move the body.

Even after getting off work, it's hard to move my body because I'm tired.

So many people are dealing with this stress and depression through food.

Eating sweet foods raises blood sugar levels, which makes you feel good.

Eating spicy food releases endorphins due to the pain in the tongue, which helps reduce stress.

In reality, many people relax after work by enjoying delicious food.

In this case, it's inevitable that you will gain weight.

The second change that occurs in your mid-20s is that growth comes to an end.

In most countries, 20 years old is considered adulthood.

This is because physical growth typically finishes around the age of 20.

The human body is made up of countless cells.

In order for the body to grow, the number of cells that make up the body must increase.

In order for the number of cells to increase, new cells must be created through cell division.

To create new cells, energy is required.

This energy is obtained from the sugars and fats stored in the body.

In this case, you will lose weight equivalent to the amount of energy consumed.

It has the effect of preventing weight gain.

On the contrary, when the body's growth is complete, the energy that was being consumed like this disappears.

It's either that you don't lose weight or that you gain weight more easily.

Does cell division stop after turning 20?

No, that is not it.

As time passes, just like a person ages and their body becomes ill.

Cells also age over time and experience issues with their functions.

These cells are referred to as senescent cells.

We need to replace these aging cells with new ones to prevent problems in the body.

Just because growth has ended, it doesn't mean that cell division stops.

However, for growth, increasing the number of cells in the entire body and

When comparing the replacement of only aging cells while maintaining a similar number of cells.

Cell division can only be less active.

In this case, the energy consumed by cell division will decrease.

It means that it becomes relatively easier to gain weight.

The hormone involved in cell division is growth hormone.

This growth hormone peaks in the mid-20s and gradually declines.

If the environment changes and activity levels decrease, and growth ends leading to a reduction in growth hormones,

I understand that it can be easy to gain weight.

So what should I do?

I can't quit the company, and I can't go back to being in a difficult situation either.

You don't have to quit the company or become young again.

The problem is that the environment has changed, leading to a decrease in activity levels.

The problem is that growth has ended and growth hormone levels have decreased.

You just need to increase the activity level and growth hormone again.

The method is simple.

You just need to exercise.

Exercising itself increases the amount of activity.

Building physical strength through exercise allows you to endure the fatigue that comes from work.

This way, it becomes possible to engage in other activities after work.

And when you move your body like this,

The stress and feelings of depression caused by not moving the body will decrease.

In that case, you will be able to avoid eating the food you used to eat after work to cope with stress and depression.

I know that the problems caused by not moving the body can be solved by exercising, but...

How do we address the issue of decreasing growth hormone?

That can also be resolved through exercise.

When you exercise, your muscle mass increases.

In order for muscle mass to increase, the number of muscle cells must increase.

In order for muscle cells to increase in number, cell division is necessary.

Growth hormone is a hormone that is involved in cell division.

If you make cell division more active through exercise, it is also possible to induce the secretion of growth hormones.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First, many people experience changes in their environment and reach the end of their growth around their mid-20s.

The environment has changed, leading to a decrease in activity levels.

When growth is complete and growth hormone decreases,

Compared to my previous body, I can relatively gain weight more easily.

The second reason is that a person who didn't gain weight until their mid-20s...

It is quite common to gain weight in your late 20s and 30s.

The third way to solve this problem is exercise.

I can organize it like this.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

As we age, growth hormone decreases.

When growth hormone decreases, weight gain occurs.

Isn't this a story about age-related weight gain?

And if you gain weight due to a decrease in growth hormone, what happens if you get growth hormone injections?

There was a question about age-related weight gain in the past, and I talked about it in detail as a series.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

If you're curious, you can click to see it.

I know that exercise is good for you.

It's really difficult to exercise while working.

I'm tired and lacking energy, and I'm also busy, so I don't have enough time.

What should I do?

Preparation is necessary for exercise as well.

A similar question was posted in the comments before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

You talk as if exercising alone will solve everything.

Isn't diet more important than exercise for weight loss?

Yes, that's right.

The question for this video is

In a situation where the same eating habits are maintained

Why do people who used to not gain weight start to gain weight as they get older?

I didn't talk about the diet because of the condition of maintaining the same eating habits.

Of course, diet is important in weight loss.

In the diet principle video I made before, I talked in detail about the diet plan.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.
