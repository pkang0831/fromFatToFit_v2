How should someone with a desk job that involves sitting all day go about dieting?

All videos have subtitles.

A story came in asking how someone with a desk job, who sits all day, should go about dieting.

I would like to tell a story.

First, let's read the content of the story.

Hello, I'm a subscriber of pkang.

I saw a video that said you need to build muscle through exercise and increase your daily activity in order to lose subcutaneous fat.

However, my job is an office job, so I spend most of my time sitting.

I think I can exercise after work.

I'm not sure how to increase my usual activity level.

There are breaks in between, but they are only about 10 to 15 minutes long.

I can't run around the office at that time. What should I do?

This is the story with such content.

Let's talk in detail.

The purpose of dieting is to reduce body fat.

Body fat is mainly divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat that is located right next to the internal organs.

It is fat that is close to the organs and clustered together, making it suitable for energy utilization.

The only place in our body where the internal organs are located is the abdomen.

So when there is an increase in visceral fat, the belly tends to protrude forward.

The abdominal muscles, which are the muscles of the belly, surround the internal organs and visceral fat.

When visceral fat increases, the abdomen protrudes, causing the abdominal muscles to also push out.

So when I touch my belly that has protruded due to visceral fat, it feels firm.

It is not the visceral fat that is felt, but rather the muscles that are surrounding it.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is the fat located beneath the skin.

It is fat that is far from the organs and spread throughout the entire body.

So, it is fat that is difficult to utilize for energy.

Instead, since it is located on the outermost part of the body, excluding the skin,

to protect the body from external shocks or impacts

Body temperature has a warming effect that prevents heat loss.

Looking at the structure, there is subcutaneous fat under the skin, and within the subcutaneous fat, there are muscles.

Since subcutaneous fat is located outside of the muscles, the muscles cannot hold the subcutaneous fat in place.

So when there is an increase in body fat, it becomes saggy.

When you touch it, you can immediately feel the fat, so it gives a soft and squishy sensation.

The fat on the arms, thighs, and lower belly is all subcutaneous fat.

In this way, visceral fat and subcutaneous fat have different locations and functions.

Due to this difference, there are variations in the methods for reducing visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

To reduce visceral fat, following a diet is effective.

To reduce body fat, it is effective to build muscle through exercise and increase your activity level.

The person in the story has a lot of body fat.

You need to build muscle and increase your activity level through exercise.

You can exercise after work, but...

I don't know how to increase my activity level because I sit all day.

To conclude, you just need to change your sitting posture.

If we divide sitting postures into two main categories, we can categorize them like this.

It is often said that leaning to the left is a bad posture for the waist.

The right side is referred to as the correct posture.

If you don't consciously try to maintain a good posture, you often end up in the posture on the left.

Why is that?

Gravity is always acting on our bodies.

This gravity pulls our bodies toward the center of the Earth.

To resist this gravity, you have to endure with the strength of your muscles or rely on your bones and joints to hold on.

If you rely on your bones and joints to hold yourself up, it leads to what is commonly referred to as bad posture.

This posture is not good for the bones and joints, but...

As much as I rely on my bones and joints, I feel comfortable because my muscles are resting.

On the other hand, if you hold your position with muscle strength, it leads to a correct posture.

The burden on the bones and joints is reduced, but it is still challenging as it requires using the muscles.

If you consciously try to maintain a correct posture,

Because the muscles are being used, the body is gradually getting warmer.

If you maintain it for a long time, your muscles will get tired and it will become difficult.

When I stand, I want to sit.

They say that when you sit, you want to lie down.

If there are no restrictions, it is because we unconsciously seek a more comfortable position.

This causes many people to sit with poor posture.

Because it's more convenient.

And this is why body fat increases.

At the beginning of the video, I talked about the differences between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat that accumulates around the organs, making it easy to use as energy, but

Subcutaneous fat is located far from the organs and is distributed throughout the body.

It is difficult to utilize as energy.

Instead, it is located on the outermost part of the body, excluding the skin.

It was said that it protects the body from external shocks and helps to retain body heat.

This part is important.

Humans are warm-blooded animals, which means that their body temperature must be maintained at a constant level.

It is not good if the body temperature drops too low, but it is also not good if it rises too high.

If you rely on gravity to support yourself through your bones and joints, you will use your muscles less.

If you don't use your muscles, the amount of heat generated in your body is less.

To maintain a stable body temperature in situations where there is little heat generated within the body,

You need to keep it well insulated so that it doesn't lose heat easily.

Therefore, more subcutaneous fat with insulating ability is needed.

Body fat increases and you gain weight.

On the contrary, if you maintain a correct posture and engage your muscles,

Because muscles are used, heat is generated in the body.

To maintain a constant body temperature, you need to release this heat outside your body.

In such situations, the insulating ability of subcutaneous fat can actually hinder the maintenance of body temperature.

This means that in order to reduce body fat, you need to exercise and be active.

The purpose of the activity itself is to generate heat by using muscles.

Maintaining good posture is also included in the activities.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

To reduce the first layer of subcutaneous fat,

You need to build muscle through exercise and increase your activity level.

The purpose of increasing the second level of activity is to generate heat by using the muscles.

Using muscles to resist gravity also counts as increasing activity levels.

Therefore, sitting is more active than lying down.

Standing has a higher activity level than sitting.

Sitting in the correct posture for the third time also increases your activity level.

Even office workers who sit all day can increase their activity levels.

I can organize it like this.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

I try to maintain a good posture, but it's so difficult that I can hardly do it for even an hour.

The reason it's difficult is because your muscles are weak, right?

In that case, you need to exercise to build muscle.

The story mentions that you can work out after getting off work.

I find it difficult to exercise because I am very busy and overwhelmed with work.

What should someone like me do?

I previously made a detailed explanation video because the same question came up.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

I’m okay with exercising or following a diet, but...

When I'm bored or feeling dull, I can't help but keep eating something.

What should someone like me do?

This question came up before, so I made a detailed explanation video about it.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right corner.

I've heard that if you don't eat after 6 PM, you can lose weight.

Is this real?

There was a question about intermittent fasting after 6 PM before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
