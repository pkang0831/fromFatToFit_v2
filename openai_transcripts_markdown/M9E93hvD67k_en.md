How to Diet While Eating Satisfyingly - Part 5: Body Type That Doesn't Gain Weight

All videos have subtitles.

For videos where subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the fifth video about having a body type that doesn't gain weight.

The first video is about a body type that gains weight easily.

In the second video, muscle and blood sugar.

In the third video, habits that prevent weight gain.

In the fourth video, we talked about fat cells.

In the fourth video, to reduce the number of fat cells,

The body needs to recognize that it does not require fat cells.

To create such an awareness, it was said that one should not starve or follow a low-calorie diet.

You mentioned that fasting is not good, so is intermittent fasting also not good?

Since I don't eat processed foods, I definitely feel full even after eating just a little.

But when I eat just a little, the calories I consume in a day are too low.

Is this becoming a low-calorie diet?

I am worried that this might prevent the reduction of fat cells.

Do I have to force myself to eat more even if I'm not hungry?

I have two questions, and they are about meal portions.

In this video, I will talk about this portion size.

The reason questions about meal portions arise is that people do not know how much they should eat.

But something seems off, right?

There are hormones in humans that make them feel hunger and fullness.

Eating according to this hormone will result in a meal portion that is suitable for my body.

If there is a lack of food, hunger will arise, leading to an increased desire to eat more.

When there is enough food, you feel full and want to stop eating.

If you eat whatever you want just because you're hungry, you'll gain weight.

This is where the problem begins.

I gained weight because I ate whatever I wanted based on how hungry I felt.

Therefore, I should not trust my appetite.

I need to figure out how much I should eat and only eat that amount.

This is the perception that many people have.

However, I shouldn't trust my appetite.

For this story to be true, one condition is necessary.

Humans are meant to become obese.

In simple terms, humans are originally designed to have a tendency to gain weight.

In the first place, since it is designed to become obese, if you eat according to your body's signals, you will become obese.

Therefore, it means that you should not eat based on the signals from your body.

But is it really true that humans are destined to become obese?

Of course, that's not the case.

The primary purpose of all living beings, including humans, is survival.

Obesity is not a favorable condition for survival.

A body that is obese is heavy, making it very uncomfortable to be active.

Excess body fat causes inflammation, which is harmful to health and hinders survival on its own.

Then why do we become obese when we eat food because we're hungry?

It's because of the type of food we eat.

In modern society, human stock is grain.

In the East, rice is the staple food, while in the West, it is wheat.

This is where the problem occurs.

Grains are fundamentally foods that have a very high carbohydrate content.

When carbohydrates enter the body, they are converted into glucose, and this glucose raises blood sugar levels.

If high blood sugar levels are maintained, inflammation occurs in the blood vessel walls.

Our body secretes insulin hormone to lower blood sugar levels.

This insulin hormone has the effect of increasing appetite.

If you consume grains that are high in carbohydrates as your staple food, your blood sugar levels will rise significantly.

When blood sugar levels rise significantly, a lot of insulin is also secreted to lower the blood sugar.

When insulin levels increase, appetite rises, leading to more frequent eating.

If the food you often eat at this time is grains, then your blood sugar rises again, causing the same problem to repeat.

So it's not that we feel hunger because we need food.

The problem with the insulin hormone causes hunger to arise.

This is called false hunger.

I don't need food, but hunger arises.

If you eat according to this false hunger, you will inevitably become obese.

It gets a bit interesting from here.

Eating grains has created a false sense of hunger.

Due to false hunger, many people eat a lot and become obese.

How much food should one eat to avoid becoming obese? This question has arisen.

Since the majority of people are already eating grains and experiencing false hunger,

There is no problem with a diet that includes grains. I think this is normal.

It becomes acceptable to frequently eat in response to false hunger.

This is where the confusion arises.

A diet that includes grains is not a problem. This is normal.

A typical example of thinking this way is

This is a balanced diet presented by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a daily meal of 2000 kcal.

A diet consisting of 60% carbohydrates, 20% fats, and 20% proteins is referred to as a balanced diet.

60% of 2000 kcal is 1200 kcal.

Since carbohydrates provide 4 kcal per gram, 1200 kcal of carbohydrates is approximately 300 grams.

A serving of 200g of rice contains about 70g of carbohydrates.

If you have three meals a day, you can obtain 210g of carbohydrates just from rice.

If you get 30g of carbohydrates in a meal with rice and other foods,

Eating 300g of carbohydrates a day is not that difficult.

But what would happen if we add the condition that grains are not eaten?

Let's consider consuming 300g of carbohydrates solely from fruits and vegetables without any grains.

In the case of leafy vegetables, the carbohydrate content is about 4g per 100g on average.

Fruits weigh an average of about 10g.

Root vegetables like potatoes or sweet potatoes weigh about 20g.

If you eat 200g each of leafy vegetables, fruits, and root vegetables, that totals 600g.

The carbohydrates you can obtain from here are approximately 70g.

However, 15-20% of these carbohydrates are dietary fiber that is not digestible.

The actual amount of carbohydrates absorbed by the body is about 60g.

So if you eat a variety of leafy vegetables, fruits, and root vegetables without grains,

To obtain 300g of carbohydrates in a day, you need to eat 3kg, which is five times 600g.

I have to eat an enormous amount.

You need to consume 20% protein and 20% fat, so you also need to eat meat.

It's not a reasonable amount to eat.

It wasn't particularly difficult to consume 300g of carbohydrates from grains in a day.

When the condition of not eating grains was added, it became almost impossible.

It's the same for having three meals a day.

This is also a method of eating that originated from consuming grains as a staple food.

Eating grains can lead to false hunger, making you want to eat more often.

Everyone is eating grains as their staple food, and everyone wants to eat food often.

It is perceived as natural and normal to have three meals a day.

That's not the case.

Humans do not necessarily have to eat grains in the first place.

In the history of humanity, the beginning of eating grains is a relatively recent event that coincides with the start of agriculture.

In most of history before that,

I ate meat obtained from hunting and vegetables and fruits gathered from foraging.

So, humans over a long period of time...

I have been following a diet that gets low carbohydrates from vegetables and fruits while obtaining a lot of fat from meat.

The body has adapted to this type of diet, storing carbohydrates in small amounts and fats in large quantities.

With the emergence of agriculture, there was a sudden increase in carbohydrate consumption, leading to side effects.

It means that the side effect is obesity.

So, how should we solve this problem?

First, we need to reduce the intake of the grains that are causing the problem.

Specifically, you need to make sure not to eat too many carbohydrates.

To be more precise, it was mentioned in the video about how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight.

You need to reduce the intake of refined foods that cause a high secretion of insulin.

And regarding the dietary habits that are formed based on the perception that "eating grains is natural,"

We need to think again.

A diet that consists of 60% carbohydrates is

It may not be a balanced diet, but rather a diet that is too high in carbohydrates.

Having three meals a day is not normal; it could be too much.

So now I can't eat grains, and should I only eat two meals a day?

No, that's not the case.

While past humanity and modern humanity are similar, they are not completely the same.

Hunting and gathering were very important activities for ancient humanity.

So, the muscles haven't developed significantly to be advantageous for long-distance movement.

However, in modern society, people tend to build large muscles for aesthetic purposes.

In general situations, the human brain uses carbohydrates as energy.

Compared to humanity in the past, modern humans use their brains much more.

There are people who require a lot of carbohydrates depending on their exercise volume, activity level, and muscle mass.

In the case of such individuals, carbohydrates are not sufficient with just vegetables and fruits.

It is necessary to intentionally eat grains.

And there are people who eat enough food in one meal, but...

Some people like to snack and eat little by little.

A person who enjoys snacking and eats a small amount of food in one meal.

You probably need to eat three meals.

So it's not that you should absolutely eat fewer carbohydrates or only have two meals a day.

It means that you should eat according to your own body, eating habits, and lifestyle.

So how can I determine the right portion size for my body?

It can be understood through hunger and fullness.

The reason we couldn't trust the signals from our bodies in the first place was due to false hunger.

However, reducing the intake of processed foods will eliminate false hunger.

In a state without false hunger, there is no reason to doubt hunger and fullness.

On the contrary, you must believe it.

Many people follow a low-calorie diet by eating less food to lose weight.

From the body's perspective, less food is coming in.

Hunger is created as a signal that more food is needed.

If you ignore this and force yourself to endure hunger,

Our bodies perceive situations where food is hard to obtain.

It triggers a response that suppresses the burning of body fat and lowers the body's metabolic rate.

This is what is commonly referred to as the hunger response.

So, in reality, even though it's easy to get food...

If it feels difficult to obtain food for the body, it becomes a problem.

How much food should I eat? This is not something you need to look for elsewhere.

I need to listen to what my body is telling me.

Let's go back to the question that was mentioned at the beginning of the video.

The first question is about why fasting or following a low-calorie diet is not good.

Is intermittent fasting okay to do?

After reducing the intake of processed foods, the false hunger disappeared.

So, if you eat a sufficient amount of food, the feeling of fullness lasts longer.

As a result, the number of meals has decreased.

So there was a fasting period during which food is not consumed.

There is no problem with this concept.

As mentioned in the intermittent fasting series, this is the correct way to do intermittent fasting.

However, I really want to eat, but I have to stick to the fasting schedule, so I'm forcing myself to hold back.

This is a situation where there is a problem somewhere.

If you are eating processed foods and are in a state of false hunger, forcing yourself to hold back...

After the fasting period ends, it can lead to binge eating, which is known as intermittent binge eating.

I'm not eating processed foods, but I'm having meals that are too low in calories.

So if I'm hungry due to a calorie deficit and I'm forcing myself to hold back...

This is a misconception that one is practicing intermittent fasting while following a low-calorie diet.

In such cases, you should definitely change your diet.

Second question.

Since I reduced my intake of processed foods, I feel full even after eating just a little.

I feel full even after eating just a little, so the calories I consume in a day are very low.

I'm worried that this might turn into a low-calorie diet.

This also varies depending on hunger and fullness.

If you are hungry but force yourself not to eat, it becomes a low-calorie diet.

If you are not eating because you are not hungry, then it's not a low-calorie diet.

The false hunger has disappeared, and the signals of hunger and fullness have returned to normal.

I don't feel hungry even when I eat little food.

This is because I am currently consuming less energy each day, so the amount of food I am eating is sufficient.

Or it could be that I have a lot of body fat, so there is energy supplied from the body fat.

It's a situation where someone is saying it's okay to eat less.

In any situation, there is no need to eat more food.

I consume a small amount of energy each day, so if I force myself to eat more here, it would be overeating.

Since you are supplying energy by burning body fat, it's okay to eat less food.

Forcing yourself to eat more here will prevent the burning of body fat.

It's something that hinders dieting.

The fact that the body consumes very little energy in a day means that...

It becomes a story about a weak body.

It means that the basal metabolic rate is low or that the level of activity is very low.

In such cases, increasing your basal metabolic rate and activity level is good for your health.

When your basal metabolic rate decreases, here are ways to raise it again.

In the fifth video about basal metabolic rate, we talked about it in detail.

The link is available at the top right, so you can refer to it.

I will summarize.

The reason we have not been able to trust the signals from our bodies all this time is...

It was due to the fake hunger caused by eating processed foods.

In other words,

By reducing the intake of processed foods, this false hunger will disappear.

We will be able to trust the signals from our bodies.

Dieting is something you do with your own body, not someone else's.

Following a diet that is tailored to someone else without thinking critically or adapting it to your own needs.

Obsessing over the daily metabolic rate calculated through simple calculations.

Rather than thinking that I must eat a certain number of calories,

Listening to what my body is telling me is the most important thing.

Simply put, after the false hunger disappears,

If you're hungry, eat, and if you're full, then you don't have to eat.

This way, you can eat plenty while still being able to diet.

You can eat until you're full without gaining weight.

In the next video, let's talk about absorption rates.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not about a body type that doesn't gain weight,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
