The best hormone for weight loss - Age-related weight loss Diet Part 2

All videos have subtitles.

If you can't see the subtitles, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

In the last video, we talked about how even people in their 20s, who are perceived as young, can gain weight.

The reason is that the growth hormone decreases.

In this video, I would like to talk about what growth hormone does.

The human body is made up of countless cells.

When this cell was first created, it was healthy and had no functional issues, but...

As time passes and cells age, problems with their function arise.

To maintain the body's functions and health, it is necessary to reduce the number of these aging cells.

Aging cells that have functional issues are eliminated through cell death.

New cells are being created through cell division to fill that gap.

Growth hormone is a hormone that affects cell division and cell death.

Growth hormone is produced the most when a person's body is growing.

As a person's body grows, it gradually becomes larger.

In order for the body to grow, the number of cells that make up the body must increase.

To increase the number of cells,

The number of cells increases, and cell division must be activated.

On the contrary, the reduction of cell numbers through cell death should be inhibited.

In fact, growth hormone activates cell division and inhibits cell death.

Many people who exercise to build muscle place great importance on growth hormones.

In order for muscle mass to increase, the number of muscle cells must increase.

This is because growth hormone helps with this.

Growth hormone activates cell division and inhibits cell death, thereby increasing the number of cells.

So I understand that it helps with muscle growth.

What effect does growth hormone have on dieting?

It is effective in reducing subcutaneous fat.

What is subcutaneous fat?

Body fat stored in the human body is largely divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Subcutaneous fat refers to the fat located beneath the skin.

It is the fat that we call "living" that can be touched and felt on my body.

Facial fat, arm fat, belly fat, and thigh fat are all subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat refers to the fat located next to the internal organs.

Since we can't touch our internal organs by feeling our bodies, we also can't touch visceral fat.

It's just fat located deeper than the abdominal muscles.

When visceral fat increases, it creates the effect of the belly protruding like a balloon.

So, you can think that a person with a prominent upper belly has a lot of visceral fat.

I talked about it in the subcutaneous fat series.

Subcutaneous fat is located quite far from the internal organs, making it difficult to use as energy.

Instead, it is spread throughout the body and is located just beneath the skin.

It is fat that protects the body from external shocks and helps maintain body temperature.

So, a diet that encourages the body to use body fat as energy does not lead to significant weight loss.

When you increase your muscle mass through exercise, you can lose weight more effectively.

Because there is muscle underneath the subcutaneous fat.

Muscles can protect the body from external impacts and can also generate heat to raise body temperature.

If you have low muscle mass and generate less heat in your body, subcutaneous fat is necessary.

If you have more muscle and generate more heat from the muscles, you need to have less subcutaneous fat to maintain your body temperature.

So, growth hormone has the effect of increasing muscle and reducing subcutaneous fat.

However, this is not the end; growth hormone also has the effect of reducing visceral fat.

When the energy supplied to the body decreases due to a low-calorie diet,

There is talk that muscle loss occurs in order to compensate for insufficient energy.

Muscle loss refers to the decrease in muscle mass.

The decrease in muscle mass means that the number of muscle cells is decreasing.

So, it means that cell death occurs.

It means that you can gain energy in the process.

In that case, the process of cell division, which creates cells, would require energy, right?

If cell division and cell death are maintained similarly,

The energy generated from cell death can be used for cell division.

But what would happen if growth hormone is released, activating cell division and inhibiting cell death?

Of course, there will be a lack of energy available for cell division.

This insufficient energy is drawn from the sugars and fats stored in the body.

The fat stored in the body referred to here is visceral fat.

Subcutaneous fat is located just beneath the skin and is distributed throughout the body.

It is difficult to use as energy because it is far from the intestines.

On the other hand, visceral fat is located right next to the organs, making it fat that is easy to use for energy.

So when the body lacks energy, it primarily uses this visceral fat.

As growth hormone is released, there is a lack of energy available for cell division.

It will use visceral fat as energy.

So, growth hormone has the effect of reducing both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat, leading to weight loss.

It's not just the end here; it also has the effect of preventing weight gain.

It was mentioned that fats can be used as energy for cell division, but sugars can also be used.

When the stored sugar in the body decreases due to cell division, it has the effect of suppressing the rise in blood sugar levels.

If you eat too many carbohydrates, your blood sugar will rise too high.

Insulin is secreted to lower this blood sugar.

This insulin lowers blood sugar while increasing body fat.

Eating too many carbohydrates and having excessively high blood sugar levels is one of the causes of obesity.

However, in parts 2 and 3 of the "Body Type That Doesn't Gain Weight" series,

I talked about ways to eat a lot of carbohydrates without significantly raising blood sugar levels.

When we eat carbohydrates, those carbohydrates turn into glucose.

This glucose can raise blood sugar levels, but it can also be stored in the muscles.

The more glucose there is in the blood, the higher the blood sugar level becomes.

The more glucose is stored in the muscles, the lower the blood sugar levels become.

As muscle mass increases, the amount of glucose that can be stored also increases.

So, if you have a lot of muscle mass, eating a lot of carbohydrates doesn't significantly raise your blood sugar levels.

So you may not gain weight.

However, even if I have a lot of muscle and can store a large amount of glucose,

Because there is a limit to storage capacity.

If you keep storing glucose without consuming it,

At some point, the storage space will be full, and it won't be able to prevent blood sugar levels from rising anymore.

So, while it's important to increase muscle mass to expand storage capacity,

It was mentioned that it is also important to use the glucose stored from exercise and activity.

Growth hormone not only inhibits cell death and promotes division but also increases muscle mass.

It also has the effect of using stored sugars as energy needed for cell division.

This is not the end; there is also the effect of increasing your basal metabolic rate.

Are you saying that an increase in muscle mass leads to a higher basal metabolic rate?

But in another video, you mentioned that even if you try to build muscle, the increase in basal metabolic rate isn't that significant, right?

Yes, that's right.

The proportion of muscle in the basal metabolic rate is about 18%.

Since muscle makes up 18% of the entire body, the increase in basal metabolic rate per kilogram of muscle is not significant.

In reality, when you increase your muscle mass by 1 kg, your basal metabolic rate only increases by about 13 kcal.

So it's difficult to say that increasing muscle mass significantly raises the basal metabolic rate.

Most of the basal metabolic rate is the energy consumed by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, and digestive organs.

These organs are also made up of cells.

When the total amount of cells increases due to growth hormone, the number of cells in this organ also increases.

As the number of cells that make up an organ increases, the function of the organ is enhanced.

Just like high-performance computers tend to have higher electricity bills.

When the function of the organs is enhanced, the energy consumed will increase.

Most of the basal metabolic rate is the energy consumed by the organs.

When the energy consumed in exercise increases, the basal metabolic rate also increases.

In summary, growth hormone is

Increase muscle mass and boost basal metabolic rate.

It helps reduce subcutaneous fat and visceral fat, and prevents weight gain.

It is natural that when growth hormones decrease, it becomes relatively easier to gain weight.

Growth hormone seems to be the perfect diet hormone.

I searched on the internet and found that there are also growth hormone injections.

Will getting that injection help with dieting?

No, that's not the case.

In the next video, let's talk in detail about growth hormone injections.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the weight loss series,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
