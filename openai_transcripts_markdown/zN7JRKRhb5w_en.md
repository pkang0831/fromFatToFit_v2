The reason why you feel full but still crave snacks.

I am following a diet for weight loss.

Even though I'm full, I still have a desire to eat something.

There are times when you want to eat snacks.

We are talking about why such desires arise and how to resolve them.

In the previous two videos, we discussed cases where there are issues with the composition of the diet.

In this video, I would like to talk about the desire to chew.

In order for a person to eat food, the process of chewing the food is essential.

Recently, with the advancement of technology, there has been an increase in foods that are sliced, minced, or ground.

There are foods that can be consumed without chewing or, even if chewed, may not be chewed enough.

Before the advancement of technology, it was essential to chew food in order to eat it.

As a result, people associate the act of chewing with the act of eating.

Even if you don't eat food, chewing on something can create the illusion that you are eating.

In fact, just chewing gum without actually eating food can reduce feelings of hunger.

In the past, this was used for a trend called gum dieting.

It's a diet method where you don't eat food in the evening and instead chew gum.

It reduces feelings of hunger, so not eating dinner isn't difficult.

So the diet worked well and gained quite a bit of popularity.

"I chewed gum a lot, and now my jaw hurts. Am I going to end up with a square jaw?"

As this story spread, the diet method quickly disappeared.

Even now, there are many questions on the internet about whether chewing gum a lot can lead to a square jaw.

Let's return to the original story.

So, because chewing food and eating are connected,

Even just chewing without eating reduces the feeling of hunger.

If you say this in reverse,

If you eat food but don't chew it enough, it can mean that your level of satisfaction may be low.

In fact, there is a saying in Korea that means "having a bored mouth."

I am full and don't want to eat, but I feel like I want to chew on something.

Most of the food we currently eat as stock is processed food.

Processed foods that are ground, crushed, or pounded don't require much chewing.

The number of times I've chewed is insufficient compared to the amount I've eaten.

It is a desire to fulfill the insufficient number of chews.

When this desire intensifies, you may want to eat a lot of food or

I feel like eating crispy snacks.

Processed foods require less chewing.

If the amount of food itself is large, the number of times you chew will eventually increase.

Crispy snacks inherently have a satisfying crunch.

However, there isn't anyone who diets while eating processed foods, right?

Everyone eats unprocessed food, so doesn't that satisfy the desire to chew?

Yes, that's right.

When creating a typical diet plan, I try to eat unprocessed foods.

As a result, it naturally leads to chewing more, which resolves the issue of the desire to chew.

There are also cases where this is not true.

The first issue is the amount of food being consumed.

In the case of unprocessed foods, they are naturally chewed a lot.

If the amount of food being eaten is small, the overall number of chews is also low.

People who are on a diet sometimes intentionally eat less food.

In this case, the lack of chewing can lead to problems.

Of course, in this case, there is a lack of calories.

The problem mentioned in the previous video may occur first.

The second issue is with soft foods.

Some people tend to eat only soft foods while planning their diet.

Some people consume shakes that are mostly made by blending their meals.

Some people eat only cooked vegetables and do not eat raw vegetables at all.

Some people only eat tofu and eggs as their protein sources.

These foods are soft, so there isn't much need to chew.

In this case, it becomes difficult to stick to the diet because the craving for chewing is not satisfied.

I start wanting to eat a lot of food, which makes me want to have a cheat day.

Or you start wanting to eat snacks.

The cause of the problem is not chewing enough, so the solution is simple.

You can add foods to your diet that satisfy your craving for chewing.

If you have only been eating cooked vegetables, please also include raw vegetables in your diet.

If you have only been eating tofu and eggs for protein, eating meat can also be helpful.

In the next video, we will talk about issues related to the digestive system.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not about digestive system issues, please wait a few more days as it is still being made.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
