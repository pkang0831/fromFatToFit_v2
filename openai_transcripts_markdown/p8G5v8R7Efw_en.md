Order of Weight Loss - Process of Losing Weight Part 2

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitle feature.

This is the second video in the weight loss process.

In part 1 of the video, I will explain how to determine what type of obesity I have.

We looked into how to distinguish between fake weight loss and real weight loss for each type.

In this video, we will discuss where the body loses fat first when losing weight.

I will talk about the order in which weight loss occurs.

I heard that the order in which people lose weight is different for everyone. Why is that?

Each person has different lifestyle patterns, and the reasons for gaining weight vary.

Body fat can be broadly divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat that is located next to the internal organs.

It is fat that serves as an energy reservoir, supplying energy to the body.

The only place in the entire body where there are internal organs is the abdomen, so the fat is only located in the abdomen.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat refers to the fat that is located just beneath the skin and is distributed throughout the body.

It is fat that is difficult to use as energy because it is far from the organs.

Instead, it is spread throughout the body and located just beneath the skin.

It is fat that protects the body from external shocks and serves the role of keeping body temperature warm.

However, this is a task that muscles can also do.

Muscles can also protect the body from external impacts.

Since it can generate heat on its own, it is more advantageous for raising body temperature.

It gets interesting from here.

Humans are warm-blooded animals that need to maintain a body temperature of 36.5 degrees.

It is not good if the body temperature drops too low, but it is also not good if it rises too high.

In a situation where there is little muscle and low activity, the heat generated by the muscles is minimal.

A lot of subcutaneous fat is needed to keep the body warm and prevent a drop in body temperature.

So, people with less muscle mass tend to have an increase in subcutaneous fat.

On the other hand, if you exercise and increase your activity level to generate a lot of heat in your muscles,

To prevent the body temperature from rising too high, it is necessary to release heat from the body.

The problem is that the subcutaneous fat, which has insulating properties, interferes with this process.

So when muscle mass increases and a lot of muscles are used, heat is generated.

To expel this heat from the body, subcutaneous fat will decrease.

So, when muscle mass increases, subcutaneous fat decreases.

When muscle mass decreases, subcutaneous fat tends to increase.

In this way, body fat is influenced by muscle.

This muscle is influenced by dietary habits, lifestyle, and genetic factors.

The order in which people lose weight can only be different for each individual.

In the case of humans, they walk upright.

In daily life, the lower body is always designed to support the entire weight of the body.

So even if you don't exercise separately,

Just by standing on two legs, the muscles in the lower body develop more than those in the upper body.

When muscle mass increases, subcutaneous fat decreases.

A lower body with a lot of muscle has less subcutaneous fat.

Conversely, the upper body with less muscle has more body fat.

So, people tend to have more subcutaneous fat in their upper body than in their lower body.

And because of this

Many people often feel that their lower body loses weight more quickly when they are on a diet.

I talked about it in "[If you want to give up because your weight loss isn't showing, watch this video]."

Comparing removing 100ml from a 1L water bottle and removing 100ml from a 300ml water bottle,

A 1-liter water bottle doesn't stand out much, but a 300ml water bottle is quite noticeable.

So even if body fat decreases similarly in the upper and lower body,

It seems that the lower body with less body fat has lost more than the upper body with more body fat.

Because of this, in general cases,

When dieting, people tend to perceive that the lower body loses weight before the upper body.

I have lower body obesity, meaning my lower body is more overweight than my upper body.

When I lose weight, my upper body loses it first, but what about me?

It gets a bit complicated from here.

The reason why the belly protrudes like a balloon when visceral fat increases is

It is because the visceral fat is pushing the abdominal muscles outward.

In the same way, when the lower body muscles develop,

The lower body becomes thicker because the leg muscles push the subcutaneous fat outward.

So, in the case of people who are significantly overweight or have a high level of activity,

The lower body muscles may be excessively developed, resulting in thicker legs.

In this case, when you diet, the upper body tends to lose weight before the lower body.

I have a lot of lower body muscle, but why does my upper body lose weight first?

The reason my lower body is thick right now is not because of body fat, but because of muscle.

When you follow a diet and exercise, body fat decreases, but muscle mass does not decrease.

To reduce the muscles in the lower body,

Reduce upper body fat to lose weight.

Weight loss should reduce the load on the lower body.

If I need to lose muscle, I guess I shouldn't do lower body exercises?

No, that's not the case.

Even if an average person exercises for about an hour a day, no matter how hard they try,

It's less than the load of walking continuously for 24 hours because I weigh 10 kg more.

So just because you exercise doesn't mean your legs will get thinner.

Moreover, the muscles developed through exercise are different from the muscles that support body weight.

And as mentioned in the lower body obesity series,

The causes of thickening in the lower body include weight, but also incorrect posture.

It is necessary to build muscle through exercise in order to maintain proper posture.

If you just lose weight without maintaining proper posture and reduce your leg muscles,

The legs are thin, but the thighs stick out a bit.

Sometimes, only the calves can become overly developed.

I will summarize.

The order in which people lose weight varies from person to person.

When there is visceral fat, the visceral fat is lost first.

After that, both the upper body and lower body drop together.

The upper body, which relatively has more body fat, feels slower.

Many people feel that their lower body is the first to lose weight.

However, in the case of individuals who are significantly overweight, very active, or have poor posture,

The muscles in the lower body can become excessively developed, causing the legs to become thick.

In this case, the reason for the thick lower body is not fat, but muscle.

As the upper body moves forward, the weight decreases.

If your weight decreases, the load on your lower body will also decrease.

At that time, the muscles in the lower body will weaken and become thinner.

At this time, we can say that the upper body moves forward first.

In a diet, you need to lose both upper and lower body weight.

The order in which you lose weight isn't important.

Why does my body lose weight starting from the upper body?  
Why does my body lose weight starting from the lower body?

Many people are curious about this, so I wanted to talk about it.

In the next video, the appearance of the lower abdomen, rather than the upper abdomen, is different from visceral fat obesity.

The lower abdomen protrudes, but it is not soft; it is firm, which is different from subcutaneous fat.

I will talk about the ET body shape.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the weight loss process.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
