The reason for not being slim despite losing weight through dieting - Eating Disorders Part 4

This is the fourth video about eating disorders.

In the third video, we talked about the reasons why distorted perceptions of weight occur.

In the case of celebrities, due to lens distortion, they appear heavier on screen than in real life.

To appear slim and pretty on screen, you actually need to lose more weight.

So, I have no choice but to drastically lose weight.

So the story was that if you diet down to a weight similar to that of a celebrity, you end up becoming too thin.

Some people agree with this content, but there are also those who do not.

I have dieted to a level similar to that of celebrities, but...

These are people who do not have a slim or thin figure and feel somewhat overweight.

I can see extra fat in various places on my body.

These people have a very low weight, but why aren't they slim?

In this video, I would like to discuss why this phenomenon occurs.

The fat in the human body is divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat that is located next to the organs and is situated deeper than the abdominal muscles.

Just like we can't touch our internal organs by feeling our bodies, it's fat that cannot be touched.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is located just beneath the skin and is fat that is outside of the muscles.

It's the fat that you can feel when you grab the skin with your hand.

In terms of health, visceral fat, which directly affects the organs, is more of a problem.

In beauty, subcutaneous fat is a bigger issue.

However, these two types of fat have different functions in the body.

There are differences in the methods of removal.

Since visceral fat is located right next to the organs, it has the characteristic of being easily utilized as energy.

So when you adjust your diet, it effectively reduces fat.

However, since subcutaneous fat is located on the outermost layer of the body, excluding the skin,

It is fat that is difficult to utilize for energy.

It is fat that protects the body from external impacts rather than being used for energy, or helps to maintain body temperature.

So, it's the fat that effectively reduces when you exercise rather than focusing on diet.

To lose body fat through diet, when fasting or following a low-calorie diet,

In some cases, the amount of body fat may actually increase.

I’ve been starving myself or following a low-calorie diet, but how is it that my body fat is increasing?

This is because the amount of muscle decreases.

In the beginning of the video, what the subcutaneous fat does is...

It was said that it protects the body from external shocks and keeps the body temperature warm.

However, this task is not only about subcutaneous fat.

It is also the role of the muscles located just below the subcutaneous fat.

Muscle and subcutaneous fat have overlapping functions, so they have a certain relationship with each other.

When muscle mass increases, subcutaneous fat decreases, and when muscle mass decreases, subcutaneous fat increases.

For example, in the case of men, there are high levels of male hormones that are necessary for building muscle.

So in most cases, men have more muscle mass than women.

So when men accumulate body fat, it mainly builds up as visceral fat.

On the other hand, women have lower levels of male hormones, which is why, in most cases, they have less muscle mass than men.

So when body fat accumulates, it mainly builds up as subcutaneous fat.

As mentioned in the basal metabolic rate series,

If you starve yourself or follow a low-calorie diet for an extended period, muscle loss can occur.

When muscle mass decreases like this, the need for subcutaneous fat increases.

So, while weight decreases, a strange phenomenon occurs where subcutaneous fat increases.

How can body fat increase while losing weight? You might think this way, but...

Muscle is much heavier than fat.

When muscle decreases and fat increases, the overall weight can decrease.

So, even if there is a lot of body fat, if there is little muscle, it can be considered a normal weight or underweight.

People like this have a normal weight but a high amount of fat, which is referred to as "skinny fat."

This is a phenomenon that often occurs in women who are losing weight by starving themselves or following a low-calorie diet.

I heard that muscle is not much heavier than fat, right?

I've been hearing a lot about that lately.

In the past, such photos circulated on the internet.

When comparing the volume of muscle and fat of the same weight, muscle is much smaller.

So, even with the same weight, if you have more muscle, you look slim, and if you have more fat, you look overweight.

Recently, there have been claims that this is not the case.

It is true that muscle is heavier than fat, but the difference is not as significant as shown in that photo.

In reality, when comparing the weights, this photo is about right.

It's hard to distinguish the difference in volume just by looking at it.

However, if you separate the muscles and fat from a person's body and compare them like that, it turns out like this.

The actual impact on weight varies.

Because glycogen and water can be stored in human muscles,

Glycogen and water also have weight, so they significantly affect body weight.

So if you actually consider the impact of muscle and fat on body weight,

Muscle increases body weight much more significantly.

I made a video about this before, and I explained it in detail in that video.

In summary, if you go on a long-term diet by starving yourself or following a low-calorie diet,

Muscle loss occurs, resulting in a decrease in muscle mass.

As muscle mass decreases, the need for subcutaneous fat increases.

The amount of subcutaneous fat increases, or subcutaneous fat does not easily decrease.

Subcutaneous fat is located outside of the muscles, so the muscles cannot hold the subcutaneous fat in place.

So it stretches and sways according to gravity, and this is what we call flesh.

I am thin enough, but I can see loose skin in various places on my body.

If this kind of fat continues to show, I won't be satisfied with my body shape.

It is a phenomenon that occurs because of becoming skinny fat.

Without realizing that one is skinny fat, one thinks they are normal.

Because I think I am normal.

I think this is the body shape that comes with this weight. I need to lose more weight to become slimmer.

So, I aim for a lower weight and start dieting.

I have lost weight by starving myself so far, so I am trying to lose more weight by starving myself further.

As a result, the aversion to food gradually increases.

If this aversion intensifies, it can lead to anorexia.

If you lose weight by starving yourself, you can become skinny fat, and you may appear to have more body fat relative to your weight.

To avoid that, you need to diet while eating.

Understanding this concept can help in addressing anorexia.

If you search for "same weight, different feeling" on the internet, you can see various photos.

Looking at such photos can be helpful.

There are indeed some exaggerated photos.

The message that body composition is more important than weight is being conveyed.

But if you stick to eating less to lose weight until the end, doesn't that eventually lead to losing even skinny fat?

Yes, that is correct.

It is true that subcutaneous fat is not easily used as energy, but...

Anyway, because it is fat, it can be used as energy.

If you continue to eat less and push yourself to the extreme,

It is possible to use subcutaneous fat as energy and ultimately achieve complete weight loss.

There are indeed cases where people diet in that way.

However, it is very, very bad for your health....

Yes, I know it's not good for my health, but I still want to lose weight because I like being thin and pretty.

Hmm... There are quite a few people who think that way.

However, in such cases,

If you make it so extreme to lose weight, is it really beautiful? Is it advantageous from a beauty perspective?

We need to consider this.

If you're thin, you're definitely pretty. The thinner you are, the prettier you become.

There is a need to correct this distorted perception of beauty.

In the next video, I will discuss the distorted perception of beauty that suggests being dry is always pretty.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to display the next video on the right once it is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 5 of the eating disorder series, please wait a few days as we are still in the process of making it.
