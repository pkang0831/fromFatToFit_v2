The reason you find dieting difficult.

Hello, this is pkang.

In this video, I would like to talk about the many reasons why people find dieting difficult.

These days, we are in an era where information about dieting is overflowing.

Anyone interested in dieting can find plenty of related information.

Then, even though dieting itself is difficult,

How to diet should be easy to understand.

I don't know how to diet.

Many people say that dieting feels complicated and difficult.

If you actually look at the comments on my video, you'll see that people watched it well and understood the content sufficiently, yet...

There are often comments saying that they don't know what to do.

So why do many people find dieting complicated and difficult?

This is because the thoughts we take for granted clash with diet information.

The purpose of dieting is to reduce body fat.

Body fat is stored energy in the body.

To lose weight, you need to use the energy from body fat somewhere.

Therefore, you need to engage in behaviors that encourage the use of body fat in order to lose weight.

This is the most basic thought that many people have about dieting.

Most people consider this thought to be obviously correct.

However, diet information directly contradicts this way of thinking.

There are various types of behaviors that encourage the use of body fat.

The most representative example is the diet.

For a person to live, the brain must think, the heart must beat, and the lungs must breathe.

Calories are being consumed daily in this process.

If the amount of food consumed is reduced and the calories obtained from food fall below this level,

The body fat will compensate for the insufficient calories.

Therefore, the less food you eat, the more body fat will decrease.

Because of these thoughts, when I am on a diet, I force myself to endure hunger even when I am hungry.

Even when eating food, I often choose low-calorie foods that have a low calorie content.

However, in the case of a low-calorie diet, there is the issue of experiencing hunger responses.

It is a response that reduces the calories the body consumes, allowing one to live even with insufficient food.

It is sometimes expressed that the basal metabolic rate has decreased.

It has entered energy-saving mode, which is also referred to as hibernation mode.

When the energy consumed by the body decreases like this, even if you eat less, you won't lose weight.

If you eat even a little more food, it becomes easier to gain weight.

In reality, most cases of low-calorie dieting lead to a yo-yo effect.

So, a low-calorie diet is not good. There is information that suggests you should diet while eating.

So I thought that in order to encourage the use of body fat, I should eat less food.

That's why there is diet information advising against it, as it can have negative effects.

Many questions arise from this.

If you eat too little, will your body become prone to gaining weight? Then should you eat enough food?

However, if you eat enough food, you won't lack energy.

If there is no energy shortage, wouldn't there be no need to use body fat?

If you don't use body fat, it won't decrease, so it seems like you won't be able to lose weight, right?

Is it necessary to eat to the point where body fat decreases, even though there is no shortage of food?

But does that make sense? If it does, what kind of food is it?

How much did people who succeeded in dieting eat? Should I follow their diet?

As questions continue to arise in this way, it becomes increasingly complicated.

Some people conclude that it's too complicated and just decide to eat less.

Even if I gain weight, if I eat less, I will lose weight.

If you continue to eat less, it is possible to maintain that weight.

And someone else.

"They say that a low-calorie diet is not good, so eat food while dieting."

Sometimes, contradictory advice is given, recommending a diet composed of low-calorie foods.

And some people blindly follow the diet of those who have successfully lost weight.

I have seen the same diet information, but everyone reacts differently.

It is the biggest reason why people find dieting difficult.

So, should we engage in behaviors that encourage the use of body fat in order to effectively lose weight?

The thought that I naturally felt was right may actually not be true.

To help with understanding, I need to briefly talk about muscles.

There are people who work hard to exercise in order to gain a lot of muscle.

What these people are most worried about is muscle loss due to a decrease in muscle mass.

But why should we worry about muscle loss?

The representative cause of muscle loss known to us is a low-calorie diet.

If you follow a low-calorie diet and your body becomes low on energy,

It breaks down muscle to use it as energy.

In this case, since the muscles have been broken down, muscle loss occurs, resulting in a decrease in muscle mass.

In other words, without following a low-calorie diet.

This means that if you eat a sufficient amount of food, muscle loss is less likely to occur.

In the case of an average person with normal muscle mass,

Unless you follow a low-calorie diet for an extended period, muscle loss is unlikely to occur.

However, in cases where muscle mass is not ordinary, the situation changes for many people.

In the case of a person with a lot of muscle mass,

Even with a sufficient amount of food, muscle loss can occur.

It's a case of resting without exercising.

If the period of rest from exercise becomes prolonged, muscle loss can occur, leading to a decrease in exercise performance.

In the case of athletes whose profession is sports, they have a lot of muscle mass while they are active as players, but...

It is common to see a decrease in muscle mass if one retires and does not exercise.

So, in the case of a person with a lot of muscle in their body,

It's not that certain actions cause muscle loss, but rather that muscle loss occurs as a result of those actions.

The reason for initially having a lot of muscle in the body is that if you don't exercise, muscle loss occurs.

If we apply this to body fat,

In the case of individuals with a high amount of body fat,

To reduce body fat, it's not about adding additional actions.

If you avoid behaviors that lead to an increase in body fat,

It means that body fat is decreasing.

The reason for the significant increase in body fat is overeating, which involves consuming more food than necessary.

So it's not that you have to eat less food, but rather...

The idea is that if you don't overeat, you can lose weight.

Muscles are organs that consume energy even when at rest.

I understand that if you have unused muscles, energy is wasted, so they decrease.

Body fat is a form of stored energy, but does it make sense for it to decrease like muscle?

Having a lot of body fat similarly leads to the problem of wasting energy.

So it can decrease.

To move a heavy object, a lot of energy is required.

This is common knowledge that everyone knows.

So, in the case of severe obesity with a high amount of body fat, people tend to avoid moving around much.

The energy used when moving is too much, so it's a natural reaction that occurs.

In modern society, there are situations where one has no choice but to keep moving.

If you are a student, you have to attend school, and if you are a worker, you have to go to work.

So, I have no choice but to move my body.

Carrying unnecessary body fat around and continuously using a lot of energy is a waste.

Of course, if it's a situation where it's hard to find food, I have to carry body fat even if it's heavy.

If it's not a situation where it's hard to find food, then there's really no need to do that.

In the case of severe obesity, the body has a strong response to reduce body fat on its own.

When someone with severe obesity starts a diet, they often experience rapid weight loss in the initial stages.

The reason is because of this reaction.

Conversely, as body weight approaches a normal level, body fat tends to decrease less effectively.

This is because the body's natural response to reduce body fat is gradually weakening.

So where does the decreasing body fat go? It can't just disappear...

It is used as energy in the body.

I have a video I made in the past that explains how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight.

In that video, it was mentioned that foods high in nutrient content and that are quickly digested and absorbed are considered fattening foods.

Foods like this cause the insulin hormone to be secreted in excess.

Insulin has the effect of storing fat as body fat and lowering blood sugar levels.

Excessively secreted insulin is

Storing fat that doesn't need to be saved as body fat causes weight gain.

The fat that should be used for energy is stored as body fat.

I eat enough food, but I feel hungry again after 3 or 4 hours.

And lowering blood sugar too much can also increase cravings for sweet foods.

This hunger and craving for sweet food does not arise from a need for food.

It is caused by the excessive secretion of the insulin hormone, and this is referred to as false hunger.

If you eat according to this hunger,

I find myself in a situation where I'm eating too much food without even realizing it.

If you reduce the intake of such foods, your appetite will return to normal.

You will be able to avoid overeating.

However, when the appetite returns to normal

It's not that people overeat, but rather that they often eat too little.

In fact, in the comments of my video,

I ate foods that don't create false hunger, and now I don't feel hungry, so my meal portions have decreased significantly.

There are often comments asking if it's okay to eat this little.

If you eat too little, it becomes a low-calorie diet, and you might worry about becoming a body that easily gains weight.

However, my appetite has returned to normal, but why am I not feeling hungry even though I eat less?

The body itself reduces body fat to supply energy.

So, if you eat foods that restore your appetite to normal without creating false hunger,

Since my appetite has returned to normal, I only feel hungry when I need food.

The body is naturally reducing body fat while continuously generating energy.

Because energy is continuously being generated, I don't need food, so I'm not hungry.

In this case, although I eat less food, it doesn't mean that my body is lacking energy.

It doesn't mean that you will easily gain weight.

However, in order to force the body to use body fat

If I intentionally eat less food or go without eating and starve,

From the body's perspective, it sent a signal that it was hungry, but since food didn't come in...

I recognize that it is difficult to obtain food, so I intend to maintain body fat.

As mentioned earlier, if it is easy to obtain food, there is no need to carry around excess body fat.

If you find yourself in a situation where food is hard to come by, body fat becomes an essential emergency food source.

In such cases, the body lowers its metabolic rate to conserve body fat.

When the body's metabolism decreases, it becomes easier to gain weight.

So even if the amount of food eaten is the same,

Not being hungry and eating less food, and

When you're hungry but try to eat less, it produces a completely different effect.

I will summarize.

To lose weight, you need to engage in actions that encourage the use of body fat.

The thought that I naturally felt was right may actually not be true.

Let go of the pressure that you need to do something for your diet.

Start by avoiding behaviors that lead to obesity.

If you create false hunger and do not eat foods that increase your appetite,

Since the appetite itself is resolved, it is possible to avoid overeating.

Just by doing this, you can reduce body fat and lose weight.

This is dieting while eating without starving.
