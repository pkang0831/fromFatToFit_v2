A Simple Yet Effective Way to Walk After Meals for Dieting - Post-Meal Exercise Part 2

I recently made a video about walking after meals.

Since it's a simple topic, I didn't plan to produce it as a series.

I see many comments asking similar questions.

I will discuss post-meal exercise in detail in a series.

First, let's look at how and how much walking after meals can help with dieting.

This content was discussed in the previous video.

The link is going out at the top right.

If you haven't seen the previous video, you can click to watch it.

The questions that come up in the comments can be broadly categorized into three main types.

The first question is how many minutes should you walk a few minutes after eating?

It's a question about how to do something.

Due to the second circumstance, I cannot walk outside.

Is it okay to do stationary walking or indoor cycling?

The last third one is about other post-meal exercises.

I am currently walking for an hour on an empty stomach. Is it better to switch this to walking after meals?

Or it's a question about weight.

In this video, we will talk about how to walk after a meal.

In the next video, we will discuss in detail about exercising after a meal.

The first question is, how many minutes should you walk after how many minutes post-meal?

In the previous video, it was mentioned that there was an experiment where walking for 30 minutes after meals resulted in a weight loss of 3 kg in a month.

The reason that is possible is that walking can suppress the rise in blood sugar after meals.

So, it's important that walking after a meal helps to suppress the rise in blood sugar.

There are differences among individuals, but...

Usually, blood sugar gradually increases over the course of one hour after a meal.

It will decrease again after reaching its peak.

The reason for walking after a meal is to lower this peak.

So, should I walk exactly one hour after eating?

No, you can do it anytime within an hour.

The number of glucose in the blood increases over the course of an hour, causing blood sugar levels to rise.

Whether you do it right after eating, 10 minutes later, or 20 minutes later.

Whenever you walk, the amount of glucose decreases.

When the level of glucose decreases, the peak of blood sugar will also decrease.

For the second question, it's difficult to walk outdoors. Is indoor walking in place or using an indoor bike also okay?

Yes, that's fine.

Just like energy is needed to move an object.

In order for a person to move, energy is needed, and

This energy uses glucose to suppress the rise in blood sugar levels.

You can achieve similar effects even if you don't walk, as long as you move your body.

You can either walk in place or ride a stationary bike.

Do you have to walk for exactly 30 minutes?

No, that's not the case.

I mentioned it at the end of the last video as well.

If you choose one among breakfast, lunch, or dinner and walk continuously for 30 minutes,

When comparing the case of walking for 10 minutes each in the morning, lunch, and dinner,

Walking for 10 minutes at a time was more effective in suppressing blood sugar increases.

So it's not so much about making sure to walk for exactly 30 minutes, but rather...

It is more important to walk every time after a meal.

So, is it better to walk for 30 minutes after every meal?

Comparing walking for 10 minutes after each meal to walking for 30 minutes after each meal,

Of course, walking for 30 minutes is better.

However, this way, it moves away from the essence of walking after a meal.

Walking after a meal has the advantage of allowing you to invest a short amount of time for a simple way to lose weight.

Investing 30 minutes after each meal for a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes is no longer just a simple diet.

If you can invest 1 hour and 30 minutes every day, then just walk for about 10 minutes after meals.

Exercising properly for an hour would be more effective, right?

What if I do weight training instead of walking after a meal?

As I mentioned in the previous video,

Intense exercises like weightlifting are not good because they interfere with digestion.

If you can't digest what you eat, isn't that better for dieting?

It may seem that way when you think about it simply.

In this case, the very purpose of weight training becomes distorted.

I will talk about the reasons for that in the next video.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the post-meal exercise part 3 video, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
