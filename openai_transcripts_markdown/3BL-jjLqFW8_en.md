The reason to reduce artificial sweeteners when dieting.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I made a video about zero cola not long ago.

Zero-calorie drinks like Diet Coke contain alternative sweeteners.

This alternative sweetener provides a sweetness that is hundreds of times stronger than sugar, but...

Because it cannot be digested or absorbed by our body.

It does not raise blood sugar and has no calories.

So when I'm on a diet and I want to eat something sweet,

People often consume alternative sweeteners.

However, we cannot digest or absorb alternative sweeteners.

The gut microbiota living in our intestines can break down alternative sweeteners.

This can change your body to a type that easily gains weight.

You shouldn't think that you can eat alternative sweeteners freely just because they don't cause weight gain.

The content of the video was that it is better to gradually reduce artificial sweeteners.

After watching that video, there were also comments expressing agreement.

I have been consistently consuming zero-calorie drinks and alternative sweeteners.

I did not feel any problems.

I have succeeded in my diet using alternative sweeteners, or I am doing well on my diet because of them.

There were also reactions that said they could not agree with your story.

In fact, there were quite a few more rejection responses.

I believe that it is better to reduce alternative sweeteners even if they pose no health issues.

I didn't expect such a strong reaction.

So in this video,

I would like to talk about the reasons why it is good to reduce alternative sweeteners, even if they do not pose health issues.

A person's sense of taste becomes dull and it becomes difficult to perceive flavors when continuously exposed to strong stimuli.

On the contrary, if you are not exposed to strong stimuli, you become more sensitive and it becomes easier to taste.

For example, a person who eats salty food becomes increasingly desensitized to the taste of salt.

Even when I eat salty food, I don't feel that it's salty.

People who eat bland food become more sensitive to salty flavors.

This applies not only to salty flavors but also to sweet flavors.

If you frequently eat foods that are high in sweetness, such as snacks, chocolate, and cake,

The strong sweetness dulls the sense of taste.

So even when I eat sweet foods, I can't feel the sweetness.

The problem is that people who eat a lot of snacks, chocolate, and cake are those who like sweet flavors.

I like sweet flavors and want to experience sweetness.

When your sense of taste becomes dull and it becomes difficult to feel sweetness,

You tend to eat more snacks, chocolate, and cake, or seek out foods with a stronger sweetness.

This is the problem.

To solve this problem, it is necessary to sharpen the sense of taste.

If you reduce your intake of sweet foods like snacks, chocolate, and cake,

The sense of taste becomes increasingly sensitive.

When your sense of taste becomes more sensitive, it becomes easier to perceive sweetness.

In that case, you will feel that it is sweet enough with a small amount of sugar.

So, we need to reduce the intake of sweet foods. When we talk about reducing sugar...

Many people think that they have to give up sweetness.

That's not it.

It makes my sense of taste sensitive, so it feels sweet enough in my mouth.

Objectively, the amount of sugar consumed should be reduced.

If you feel sweet enough with a small amount of sugar, then...

You won't need to eat a lot of sugar anymore.

The desire for foods high in sugar will naturally decrease.

In fact, in the comments of my video,

There are quite a few comments saying that their taste has changed after following the recommended diet.

It used to be a snack that I liked and ate often.

Right now, it's too sweet, so I don't want to eat it.

The sweetness is so strong that it makes me dizzy when I eat it, so it's hard to eat.

So it's not that I want to eat snacks, but I have to hold back because I'll gain weight.

My taste has changed, so it doesn't taste as good as I expected, and that makes me not want to eat it.

If you eat a lot at once, you get dizzy, so the way of eating is changing to eat a little bit at a time.

If you change the way you eat, you may not gain weight even when eating cake or snacks.

If you don't want to eat, you won't eat in the first place, so you won't gain weight.

This is the most ideal situation in dieting.

But artificial sweeteners interfere with this.

So while dieting, my intake of sweet foods decreases and my taste changes.

The food that I used to love, which made me overweight, is too sweet and overwhelming.

So you should either lose your appetite or change to be satisfied with just a little bit even if you do eat.

If you continuously expose your taste buds to strong sweetness through alternative sweeteners,

The state of having a dull sense of taste remains unchanged.

In this way, the food that made me obese is still delicious to me.

Therefore, that food becomes something you want to keep eating.

I want to eat it, but if I do, I'll gain weight, so I have to hold back.

The problem is that there is a limit to how much one can endure.

No matter how long it takes, when the limit is reached, you will eventually eat that food.

In that case, there is a high possibility of returning to the original eating habits.

If I go back to my original eating habits, I will gain weight again.

In reality, people who drink about one can of alternative sweetener beverages a day are

There are statistics indicating an increase in the occurrence of cardiovascular complications such as heart attacks and strokes.

Artificial sweeteners are not a direct cause of heart attacks and strokes.

However, people who drink beverages with artificial sweeteners...

My taste for sweet foods remains unchanged.

Since my taste for sweets remains the same, my other eating habits are not healthy either.

Unhealthy eating habits lead to an increase in the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases.

So to summarize,

While maintaining a diet that includes a lot of sugary foods

Changing the means of sweetness from sugar to alternative sweeteners is

This is not a proper diet.

The habit of consuming a lot of sugary foods in the first place is what causes problems for dieting.

Due to these eating habits, a yo-yo effect can happen at any time.

It's similar to carrying around a bomb that could explode at any moment.

The short-term goal of dieting is to reduce body fat, but

The long-term goal is to improve eating habits and lifestyle so that I don't gain weight again.

To achieve that, you need to improve your eating habits by reducing sugary foods.

To do that, you also need to gradually reduce alternative sweeteners along with sugar.

If you are watching this video,

I can never give up on artificial sweeteners.

I feel angry thinking that we should reduce artificial sweeteners.

No matter what you say, I will still eat artificial sweeteners.

You are a bad person for speaking negatively about alternative sweeteners.

If such a strong sense of resistance arises,

You need to consider whether having such a strong obsession with sweetness is really not a problem.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

I understand that reducing sugary foods can make your taste buds more sensitive, which may help prevent yo-yo dieting.

So, in the end, don't we have to eat tasteless diet food?

That seems really hard to eat.

When we talked about the diet plan.

Many people think of unsalted chicken breast or vegetable salad without dressing.

Such food is naturally tasteless and difficult to eat.

There was no need to eat like that in the first place.

A comment was posted saying that instead of dieting with tasteless food, they would rather starve to lose weight.

I made a video about not having to eat that kind of food.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

We cannot digest artificial sweeteners, but gut microorganisms can break them down.

You mentioned that it can change the body to a constitution that makes it easy to gain weight because of that.

Please tell me more about that.

I talked about it in the Zero Cola video I made a while ago.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the upper right corner.

If I'm busy and have a simple meal or don't eat at all, it's fine.

When I have a proper meal, I always feel like having something sweet afterwards.

I really crave sweet coffee or chocolate, so I end up consuming a lot of alternative sweeteners.

Why do we crave sweet foods after a meal?

It is due to the fluctuation in blood sugar levels.

This question came up before, so I made a detailed explanation video about it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

If your taste changes in the middle of the video, the way you eat snacks, chocolate, and cake will also change.

You said that if that happens, you can eat snacks, chocolate, and cake without gaining weight.

Please tell me more about that.

I made a video because the same question came up.
