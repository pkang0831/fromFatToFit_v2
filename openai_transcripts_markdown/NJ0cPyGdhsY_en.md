Are protein supplements good or bad for dieting? - Appetite Part 3

All videos have subtitles.

The cause of obesity is eating more food than necessary.

The cause of overeating is processed refined foods.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about refined carbohydrates.

In the second part of the video, we talked about refined fats.

In this video, I would like to talk about refined protein.

A representative refined protein is processed meat made by grinding or chopping meat.

There is a protein supplement made by extracting protein and turning it into powder.

Is protein supplement refined protein?

Yes, that's right.

Let's think about the reasons why we take supplements.

For effective muscle growth, a lot of protein is needed.

It's hard to eat a lot of unrefined protein like meat, and the amount that gets absorbed by the body isn't very high.

It's about taking supplements that can be easily consumed in large quantities and are well-absorbed.

You can eat a large amount so easily like this.

Food that is processed to enhance absorption is called refined food.

It's a bit ambiguous to call supplements food, but...

It has the characteristics of processed food.

You said that eating processed foods makes you gain weight. So, do supplements also make you gain weight?

There are some differences depending on the situation.

In the last video, it was mentioned that insulin lowers blood sugar or stores fat as body fat.

There is another function of insulin.

I help with the process of protein synthesis.

The reason for consuming a lot of protein through supplements is for muscle growth.

To utilize the large amount of protein consumed for muscle synthesis, a significant amount of insulin is also needed.

So, should I take the supplement with carbohydrates?

Eating carbohydrates raises blood sugar levels.

When blood sugar levels rise, insulin is secreted.

Do you need to eat carbohydrates along with protein for muscle growth? This is something you might consider.

You don't have to do it that way.

As mentioned in the second part of the video, protein itself stimulates insulin.

Eating a lot of protein leads to increased insulin secretion.

However, in the second part of the video

When you consume refined carbohydrates and a lot of insulin is released, and then you eat fat...

It was said that a lot of insulin stores fat as body fat, leading to obesity.

So, it was said that foods combining refined carbohydrates and refined fats are the most fattening.

This is also true for refined protein.

Eating a lot of refined protein leads to increased insulin production.

In such situations, consuming a lot of refined fats can lead to an increase in body fat, resulting in obesity.

In the past, the cause of obesity was considered to be high-calorie foods, but

Recently, it is believed that consuming processed foods leads to excessive insulin production, which is considered a cause of obesity.

So if you don't eat processed foods, you can still lose weight even if you eat fat.

In the case of someone who does bodybuilding or a trainer who teaches exercise,

There are still many cases where low-fat diets are recommended.

There have been many questions in the comments about this.

If, as Ronka said, you can lose weight even when eating fat without consuming processed foods,

Why do bodybuilders and trainers still recommend low-fat diets?

The reason is due to the refined protein.

For bodybuilders and trainers, building muscle is considered very important.

So, many people consider consuming a lot of protein to be almost essential.

Many proteins cause a significant release of insulin.

Eating fat here increases body fat, leading to obesity.

Instead of eating a lot of fat, I eat a lot of protein.

You can think of it as being more focused on muscle growth rather than dieting.

So is it good or bad to consume refined protein?

The difference depends on how and how much you consume refined protein.

The reason I say refined foods are not good is ultimately because of the amount consumed.

The sugars in fruits are quickly digested and absorbed, and consuming a large amount can lead to obesity.

However, fruits are made up of 80-90% water.

So when I actually ate it, I couldn't eat a large amount.

I said it was okay because I couldn't eat a lot.

Hearing that, if the sugars in fruits are quickly digested and absorbed, and they contain water, then it's okay.

Is it okay to drink water while eating other refined carbohydrates?

There are people who ask questions like this.

It's not that it's okay because there's moisture; it's okay because the moisture prevents you from eating a large amount.

It's not about whether there is moisture or not that matters, but rather...

How much you eat is important.

Fill your stomach with vegetables to reduce the amount of refined carbohydrates you consume.

Fill your stomach with water to reduce the amount of refined carbohydrates you consume.

I just endure it with my willpower and reduce the amount of refined carbohydrates I eat.

Everyone has reduced refined carbohydrates, so there is a similar effect.

In reality, I eat plain white rice as it is, but I reduce the amount I eat by half.

There is a diet that involves eating vegetables to make up for the insufficient amount.

There is a diet that involves drinking 500ml of water before meals to reduce the amount of food consumed.

The methods are different, and that's why the names of the diets are different as well.

In the end, the goal is the same: to reduce the intake of refined carbohydrates.

The reason it is recommended to reduce refined foods and eat unrefined foods is based on the same concept.

Processed foods increase appetite the more you eat them, making you want to eat more.

It's not because consuming even 1g of processed food will cause body fat to increase explosively.

In the last video, we talked about how all the oils we consume are refined fats.

Olive oil, which is said to be good for health,

Olive oil is made by pressing unrefined food to extract only the fat.

When you try to eat, you can consume a large amount, and digestion and absorption are also very quick.

So I mentioned that it's important to be careful not to eat too much.

From the comments, it seems that many people have interpreted that they shouldn't consume things like olive oil and avocado oil.

It's not that you shouldn't eat it, but rather how much you eat is what matters.

If you eat a lot, it becomes a problem, and if you don't eat much, it doesn't become a problem.

How should we determine what is considered a lot or a little?

You can determine whether the amount you can eat is appropriate when consuming unrefined foods.

For example, there are areas with a lot of fat and areas with little fat, but

The average fat content in 100g of pork is about 14g.

If you eat about 200g of pork in one meal, the amount of fat you would consume would be around 28g.

In that case, about 28g of fat per meal is not a large amount.

It's a sufficient amount that can be eaten with unrefined foods.

When I ate unrefined food like this

You can think of it as a quantity that is not much for me, but is enough to eat without any aversion.

The same goes for refined protein.

The problem arises when you continuously consume an excessive amount of protein that cannot be processed when eating meat.

Conversely, even if you consume refined protein, it is fine as long as you control the amount you eat.

For example, I want to follow a diet plan and build muscle through exercise.

I bought raw meat to eat, but grilling it is too much of a hassle.

Raw meat spoils very easily.

So I heat it up in the microwave.

I plan to eat products like cooked chicken breast, chicken breast sausage, and chicken breast steak.

It is okay to consume one of these products in a single meal.

Typically, the products are divided into portions of about 100g to 200g, which is not a large amount.

In reality, there are many people who have successfully lost weight by using such products.

However, the chicken breast sausage and chicken breast steak are surprisingly delicious.

Eating a large number of items at once can be problematic.

Because it's about eating a lot.

The same concept applies to protein supplements as well.

I want to eat protein for muscle growth, but it's difficult to eat unrefined foods.

Taking protein supplements as an alternative may not be a significant issue.

However, it is important not to eat too much or too often during this time.

Having too much protein can itself lead to health issues.

Eating too much protein too often from the beginning actually hinders muscle growth.

In reality, changing the intervals at which protein is consumed or

There was an experiment that compared different amounts of protein consumed at one time.

Eating a lot of protein frequently does not necessarily guarantee muscle growth.

In fact, there have been results indicating that it can hinder muscle growth.

I previously made a related video about this kind of experiment.

The link is going out at the top right.

Those who are interested can click to see it.

I will summarize.

Even if I try to eat a lot of unrefined foods, I can't eat much due to the nature of the food.

So if you're eating unrefined foods, there's no need to worry about overeating.

On the other hand, processed foods can be consumed in large quantities if one wants to.

It is a warning to be careful because problems arise when you eat too much.

Even if I eat processed food, I can control the amount I consume.

And I know exactly how much I should eat.

People like this can lose weight by controlling their intake of refined foods.

However, I don't really know about that and I don't want to know.

I just want to diet while eating comfortably and feeling full.

It is recommended for such individuals to consume as little sugar as possible.

It's better to choose the method that suits you among the two options.

Recently, there have been many comments about people who were consistently following their diet but suddenly experienced a surge in appetite and ended up binge eating.

In the next video, I will discuss the reasons why cravings can arise after following a good diet and how to address them.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 4 of the appetite series, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.
