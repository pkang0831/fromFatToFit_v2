A comment about upper body obesity has been posted.

When I gain weight, it tends to accumulate in my upper body, like my arms and back, while my lower body doesn't gain weight easily.

The upper body and lower body differ by about two sizes.

It is said that when dieting, the lower body loses weight first, and the upper body loses weight later.

When you continue dieting, you do lose weight in your upper body, but it is said that a plateau will come before long.

In this video, I would like to talk about why that happens and discuss upper body obesity.

What we call flesh is actually fat.

The fat in the human body is largely divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat refers to the fat that is located next to the internal organs.

Subcutaneous fat refers to the fat located beneath the skin.

The only place in the human body where internal organs are located is the abdomen. Therefore, visceral fat is only found in the abdomen.

Subcutaneous fat is distributed throughout the entire body.

To summarize the comments, the body type has more subcutaneous fat in the upper body than in the lower body.

When dieting, subcutaneous fat in the lower body tends to decrease easily, but subcutaneous fat in the upper body does not decrease as readily.

The reason this phenomenon occurs is due to the characteristics of subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat that is located right next to the internal organs.

It is fat that is good for energy utilization because it is close to the organs.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is distributed throughout the body and is the outermost layer of fat, excluding the skin.

Because it is far from the internal organs, it is difficult to utilize it as energy.

Instead, because it is located on the outside,

It protects the body from external shocks and prevents the loss of body heat.

Due to these differences, diet is effective in reducing visceral fat.

Exercise is effective for reducing subcutaneous fat.

Why is exercise effective in reducing subcutaneous fat?

Muscles generate heat when they are used.

Humans are warm-blooded animals, which means that their body temperature must be maintained at a constant level.

When a lot of heat is generated in the muscles, it causes an increase in body temperature.

To maintain a constant body temperature, this heat needs to be released outside the body.

Subcutaneous fat with insulating properties interferes with this.

So, in a situation where there is low muscle mass and low activity level, the heat generated within the body is also low.

The insulating ability of subcutaneous fat helps to maintain body temperature, but...

In situations where there is a lot of muscle mass and high activity levels, there is a lot of heat generated within the body.

It is said that the insulating ability of subcutaneous fat hinders the maintenance of body temperature.

By increasing muscle mass and activity through exercise, subcutaneous fat decreases.

So, if you wear a lot of clothes and live in a hot environment, does that mean the subcutaneous fat decreases significantly?

No, that's not the case.

The heat inside the body and the heat outside the body are different.

There were so many questions about this that I made a related video.

The video link is displayed in the upper right corner, so if you're curious, you can click on it to watch.

Returning to the original story.

In our bodies, areas with a lot of muscle and where that muscle is used frequently have less subcutaneous fat.

Conversely, areas with less muscle and where muscles are not used effectively tend to accumulate more subcutaneous fat.

Due to the characteristics of bipedalism, the lower body supports the weight.

Basically, the lower body has more muscle mass than the upper body, and therefore has less subcutaneous fat than the upper body.

Conversely, the upper body has less muscle mass than the lower body, and therefore has more subcutaneous fat than the lower body.

So it's a natural phenomenon that the upper body gains more weight and doesn't lose weight compared to the lower body.

So what about people who are struggling with lower body obesity?

People who are concerned about upper body obesity often struggle with having a lot of flabby and sagging fat.

For example, I am worried about having a lot of arm fat or back fat.

On the other hand, a person with lower body obesity is concerned about thickness.

I'm worried because my thighs and calves are too thick.

The reason why the thighs or calves are too thick is due to muscle.

When a person becomes overweight due to obesity, the lower body muscles develop to support that heavy weight.

So, in the case of people with severe obesity, they can have a lot of muscle mass even if they have no experience with exercise at all.

Due to the developed muscles, my legs have become too thick.

It is referred to as lower body obesity when the legs become too thick.

So, a person who is struggling with upper body obesity is concerned because they have a lot of subcutaneous fat in their upper body.

People who are concerned about lower body obesity are worried that their lower body looks too thick due to having a lot of muscle mass.

I previously covered lower body obesity in detail in a series of videos.

Let's return to the original story.

To reduce body fat, it is necessary to increase muscle mass and use that muscle to generate heat.

Exercising is effective for reducing subcutaneous fat.

The problem is that most people try to lose weight solely through diet without exercising.

However, there are people who lose weight by starving themselves.

Yes, that's right.

Subcutaneous fat is difficult to use as energy, but fat is still fat.

If you follow a starvation diet or a low-calorie diet for a long time, you will lose subcutaneous fat.

It is possible, but it is very inefficient and there is a high risk of yo-yo effects.

And with this method, while lower body subcutaneous fat may decrease, upper body subcutaneous fat does not reduce easily.

The upper body has less muscle mass compared to the lower body, but instead has more subcutaneous fat.

On the contrary, the lower body has more muscle mass compared to the upper body and has less subcutaneous fat.

In such a situation, if there is a lack of energy and body fat needs to be used as energy,

Which part of the body, the upper body or the lower body, uses subcutaneous fat as energy?

It is subcutaneous fat in the lower body.

Muscles generate heat when they are used.

Even if the subcutaneous fat in the lower body decreases, muscles can generate heat to maintain body temperature.

However, the upper body, which has less muscle mass than the lower body, cannot do that.

Even if you work hard and starve yourself to lose weight because of this, only the subcutaneous fat in your lower body will decrease.

After a slight reduction in upper body subcutaneous fat, a plateau phase occurs.

The goal of all living beings is survival.

In order for a person to survive, they must maintain their body temperature.

To maintain body temperature, one cannot give up subcutaneous fat in the upper body.

Rather than starvation diets or low-calorie diets,

Eating properly and exercising to build muscle is effective in reducing body fat.

I am exercising hard, but I have upper body obesity. Why is this happening to me?

The type of exercise you are doing could be the problem.

In the next video, let's talk about what exercises we should do.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of upper body obesity, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
