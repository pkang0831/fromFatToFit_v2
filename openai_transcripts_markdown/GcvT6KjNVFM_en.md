Reasons for Overeating on Cheat Days and Solutions - Appetite Part 7

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the seventh video about appetite.

The reason we become obese is that we eat too much food.

The reason for overeating is that there is a problem with appetite.

In the last video, we talked about the reasons why appetite issues arise and how to solve them.

However, there are cases where appetite cannot be controlled even after trying all the solutions.

In this video, let's talk about this.

Even if you are following a proper diet, there are two main reasons why you might feel that your appetite is not under control.

The first reason is the intensity of appetite, and the second reason is emotional factors.

Let's talk about them one by one.

We currently live in an environment where obtaining food is very easy, but...

For early humans who lived by hunting and gathering, finding food was not an easy task.

As a result, there was a significant possibility of nutritional imbalance occurring.

For example, let's imagine that you have successfully hunted and obtained a large amount of meat.

If you have secured a large amount of meat that can fill you up just by eating meat alone,

Did ancient humans go outside to gather food?

If you think about it logically, that's not the case.

You don't have to go outside to gather food because there are foods you can eat to your heart's content.

However, meat is rich in protein and fat, but it contains very little carbohydrates.

To live, a person needs carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

In modern times, this information is known.

In the era of hunting and gathering, there was no such information.

However, just because one is unaware of this information, it shouldn't lead to a threat to survival due to nutritional imbalance.

There is an instinctive response to balance nutrition.

It's a craving for other food, not the food I'm eating right now.

Because of this, even if I eat enough food,

If the food I ate lacks carbohydrates, I want to eat more food that is rich in carbohydrates.

When there is a lack of fat, you start to crave foods that are rich in fat.

And the appetite felt at this time is very strong.

Because in a situation where it's hard to find food, I would leave the food I struggled to obtain.

You have to make it so that I want to go out and find more food.

So you end up feeling much stronger hunger than what you actually need.

In reality, I feel so hungry that I think I could eat a lot of food.

When you actually eat it, you often can't eat much and feel full; this is an experience everyone has had.

In the last video, I mentioned that when you lose weight through dieting, there can be deficiencies in your diet.

To fill that deficiency, appetite may increase.

When your appetite increases, try eating an additional 100 to 200 grams of potatoes or sweet potatoes.

I suggested trying to consume about 1 to 2 tablespoons more of the oil.

However, there aren't many people who actually use this method.

Because the characteristic of appetite is that it is felt more strongly than what is actually needed.

I don't want to eat potatoes, sweet potatoes, or oil.

I want to eat processed refined foods that are high in carbohydrates or fats.

I don't want to eat potatoes, sweet potatoes, or oil in the first place.

I don't think eating that will solve anything, so I don't even try.

However, please try it at least once.

Sometimes, just a small amount of carbohydrates or oil can really help control appetite.

What if I still want to eat refined foods?

I have applied everything from the last video, and I have also applied the content from this video.

If you still want to keep eating processed foods, it is often due to emotional issues.

It is often said that eating sweet foods makes you feel happy, and

They say that eating spicy food relieves stress.

So when I'm feeling depressed or not in a good mood, I often seek out sweet foods.

In situations where we experience a lot of stress, we often crave spicy food.

Whenever emotional issues arise, if they have been resolved with food,

Even if there are no issues with the diet, emotional problems can lead to an increase in appetite.

In a similar concept, there are cases where loneliness or emptiness is filled with the sense of fullness that comes from food.

Even if there are no issues with the diet, feeling loneliness and emptiness can increase appetite.

The cause of the problem is negative emotions.

So reducing those emotions can be quite helpful for dieting.

There are various ways to change your mood.

Listening to exciting music or having a hobby is also an option.

Even light exercise that isn't difficult can have a mood-lifting effect.

Of course, eating is the easiest and quickest way to change your mood, but

Gaining weight from eating like that requires time and effort to lose it through dieting.

It's important to find your own way to refresh your mood without eating.

In the case of loneliness and emptiness, meeting people is the most helpful.

If it were easy to meet people in the first place, we wouldn't feel loneliness or emptiness.

Due to a lack of confidence in appearance, feeling bothered, or not having enough time, there are many cases where it is difficult to meet people for various reasons.

Recently, there are many cases of online meetings using voice chat programs like Discord.

Since it's about meeting people online, there are no issues of inconvenience or lack of time.

Since the voice conversation only connects through voice, appearance is not an issue at all.

If meeting people in person is difficult, this method may be helpful.

Isn't there a time when you just want to eat regardless of negative emotions?

There are times when I just want to eat.

There are times when I want to eat simply because the food itself tastes good.

In this case, the desire to eat arises because you like the food and want to eat it.

There is no way to stop this.

I just want to eat what I want.

If there's no way to stop it, can I eat it? But if I eat it, I'll gain weight.

Yes, that's right.

However, eating refined foods just once does not immediately lead to obesity.

Over a long period of time, consistently and excessively consuming processed foods leads to obesity.

The reason for reducing the intake of refined foods and eating unrefined foods is

You should diet with unprocessed foods and make your body's hormonal metabolism healthy.

Sometimes eating processed foods is not a problem.

So if you have a desire to eat refined foods simply and without any other reason,

You can eat processed foods.

You just need to pay attention to the amount you eat.

I mentioned it at the beginning of the video.

Appetite actually gives the feeling of wanting to eat more than the amount I really want to eat.

So, if it were up to me, I would want to buy a lot of processed foods and eat them all.

When you actually try it, you feel satisfied even without eating a lot.

However, most people are unaware of this fact.

I prepare quite a lot of food depending on my appetite.

And the problem is that you eat all of it.

Even if I don't eat a lot, I'm satisfied enough. Why do you eat all the food that was prepared in abundance?

There is a lot of food that I've prepared.

I talked about it in the satiety series.

When there is too much food prepared, it is quite common to unconsciously overeat.

Sometimes, people overeat before they even feel full because they eat too quickly.

I think it's wrong to leave food and throw it away, so I force myself to eat everything.

I sometimes force myself to eat everything because I feel it's a waste to leave leftover food.

I sometimes force myself to eat everything because I'm too lazy to clean up food waste.

The problem is that this behavior occurs unconsciously.

I forced myself to eat everything, but there are many cases where I don't realize that this is wrong.

Because of the strong appetite I feel compared to the actual amount I want to eat.

Preparing too much food and having various reasons for not being able to eat it all is the problem.

It is enough to eat a smaller amount of food than the appetite I am feeling right now.

Think about this and consciously reduce the amount you prepare.

Please eat the food you have prepared slowly if possible.

If you feel full while eating and want to stop,

Even if there is a lot of leftover food, even if it's a waste, even if it's bothersome, you should just throw it all away.

You can only solve the problem by doing it this way.

How does pkang's eating broadcast affect appetite?

Seeing someone enjoy their food makes me want to eat too, so there's a saying that it increases appetite.

There is also a saying that when you experience vicarious satisfaction, your appetite decreases.

I'm curious about which side is correct.

In the next video, I will talk about mukbang.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not Episode 8 of Appetite, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.
