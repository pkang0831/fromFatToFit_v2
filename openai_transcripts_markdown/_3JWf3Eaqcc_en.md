The topic of this video is whether it is okay to eat refined carbohydrates while controlling calorie intake.

A comment has been posted regarding the content shown on the left, and this is the second response video to that question.

If you haven't watched the first video and don't know the content of the questions, please pause the screen and check the questions.

I am curious about the appropriate carbohydrate intake for adult men and women who are not on a diet. 

I understand that refined carbohydrates can be consumed endlessly and can interfere with dieting. 

However, if I consume a balanced diet of refined carbohydrates, protein, and fats while maintaining an appropriate total calorie intake, is that acceptable? 

I have heard that this can lead to a reduction in muscle mass due to refined carbohydrates, with fat taking its place, resulting in stable weight but an increased body fat percentage. Is this incorrect information?

To summarize the question, there are two inquiries.

1. What is the appropriate amount of carbohydrate intake?

2. Is it okay to eat refined carbohydrates as long as I control my calorie intake?

The answer to the first question has been covered in another video, and the video link is displayed in the top right corner.

If you're curious, you can click the link to watch the video.

In this video, I will talk about the second question.

To get straight to the point, if you consume refined carbohydrates while controlling your calorie intake, then...

It is possible to maintain your weight or go on a diet.

For example, if our body needs an energy level of 100,

If you consumed 100 units of energy from refined carbohydrates,

Because refined carbohydrates were consumed, blood sugar rises sharply, and in order to lower blood sugar, some of the energy becomes fat.

For example, let's say that around 30 has become fat.

The energy our body needs is 100.

Since 30 of the energy has turned into fat, the actual usable energy is 70, right?

So, because 30 is insufficient,

You start to feel hungry.

If you eat additional food without resisting hunger, the stored 30 units of fat will not be used.

If this continues to happen, body fat will increase, leading to obesity.

If you endure hunger and do not eat, your body will use stored fat.

In that case, maintaining weight or dieting is possible.

Rather, it leads to weight loss. This is due to the issue of energy conversion.

The energy of 30 is stored as fat, resulting in a loss, so it becomes an amount of fat less than 30.

In the process of converting fat back into energy, there are losses, resulting in a smaller amount of energy.

100 units of energy came in, and 30 were stored as fat. When it is converted back to energy, it will be less than 100.

The body needs 100 units of energy, but since the available energy is low, weight will decrease.

The question about whether consuming refined carbohydrates leads to muscle loss can be answered with this.

Muscle loss occurs when the body does not receive enough energy.

Reducing muscle mass to decrease energy consumption in the body is referred to as muscle loss.

Eating refined carbohydrates does not mean that you will lose muscle.

However, in order to consume refined carbohydrates, you need to limit your calorie intake.

Because refined carbohydrates can be eaten endlessly if you eat as much as you want.

To eat refined carbohydrates, you need to limit your calorie intake.

I thought I had eaten enough due to the energy loss issue, but I was lacking energy and experiencing muscle loss.

There may be someone listening to this who is having interesting thoughts.

If consuming refined carbohydrates leads to issues with energy conversion, then the actual usable energy in the body may be low.

Isn't eating refined carbohydrates good for dieting?

However, it is very difficult to control calories while consuming refined carbohydrates.

It's a well-known fact that if you control your calorie intake, you can maintain your weight or lose weight, regardless of what food you eat.

This is the theory of calorie dieting.

This theory is a diet theory that came out more than 10 years ago.

This is a diet that many people have attempted because the theory is simple yet persuasive.

There are still many people who are taking on challenges.

However, most people who take on challenges fail.

Many people blame those who have failed.

"Why can't you even endure that?"

"You're gaining weight because you eat like that."

"Try to do it with determination."

I don't think that people who have failed should be blamed.

This is because the increase in appetite caused by refined carbohydrates is beyond what a person's willpower can withstand.

But what about people who have succeeded with a calorie diet?

Those people have an incredible willpower.

These people are not the average.

Ordinary people are those who challenge themselves with failures and become remarkable individuals through their successes.

It's normal for people to fail.

If this is not the case, then the global population of obese individuals should have decreased since the time when calories were labeled on food.

I can know the calories of the food I eat.

However, in reality, the number of obese people worldwide has continued to increase even after the introduction of calorie labeling.

I know that eating this food will make me gain weight.

I want to know how many calories it has.

I know that it has too many calories.

But you can't help but eat the food.

Because the increase in appetite caused by refined carbohydrates is too strong.

So, is it possible to manage weight by consuming refined carbohydrates while controlling calorie intake?

It is theoretically possible.

However, actually implementing it will be very difficult.

Even if you succeed, it will be painful.

So, when trying to diet, it's better not to consume refined carbohydrates at all.

Sounds plausible, right?
