I exercise for 2 to 3 hours a day.

I received a story about someone who is afraid of gaining weight if they reduce their exercise time.

Let's take a look at what the story is about.

Hello, I am a high school senior girl who has been consistently watching YouTube.

I was chubby since I was young.

I lost a little weight while getting my teeth straightened.

In the third year of middle school, I was 163 cm tall and weighed 56 kg.

From that time on, I started to become a little obsessed with my weight.

In the beginning, the obsession wasn't that strong.

At the end of the first semester of the first year of high school.

I felt that I was losing weight since I didn't eat lunch.

Since then, up until now in my third year, I have never eaten lunch at school.

When the symptoms worsened, I ate one rice cake and one Almond Breeze in the morning.

In the evening, I think I either had an energy bar or something very simple to eat.

As a result, by the time I finished the first grade, I was 166 cm tall and weighed 42 kg.

With not going to school due to COVID, I have had a lot of free time.

I spend my spare time exercising and I don't eat more than I need to.

I have lost weight down to 37 kg.

Then my parents took me to the hospital and also got rid of the scale.

After that, I started eating a little bit, but I was worried about gaining weight, so I only had dinner.

I am still eating like that.

However, the rate at which I gain weight is too fast.

I walk for almost 2 hours a day and do home workouts, but I'm still gaining weight.

I have gained weight and now weigh 53 to 54 kg.

I haven't even eaten things like chicken, pizza, or tteokbokki.

It's so frustrating and anxiety-inducing to have gained nearly 20kg in just a few months.

I go to school every day now.

To walk 20,000 steps a day, I keep walking alone during my breaks and lunch time.

I want to chat with my friends and relax, but I'm really, really afraid of gaining weight.

If the time for exercise decreases compared to now and the number of steps taken significantly decreases, can I still avoid gaining weight?

I don't know what to do.

Please help me.

It's a story with that content.

Let's talk about what the problem is and how we can address it.

First of all, the person sharing their story is basically following the calorie diet theory.

The energy we obtain from food is called caloric intake.

When we refer to the energy our body consumes as calorie expenditure,

If the calorie intake is greater than the calorie expenditure, there will be excess calories left over.

This excess calorie is accumulated as body fat, leading to weight gain.

Conversely, if the calories consumed are greater than the calories burned, there will be a calorie deficit.

This is because the body pulls out the necessary calories from body fat, which leads to weight loss.

This is the calorie diet theory.

The theory itself is very simple and not difficult to understand.

There are many people who believe in this.

In the past, it was considered the truth of dieting.

The person sharing their story is one of those people.

The problem is that there is a very significant flaw in this theory.

For the calorie diet theory to hold true,

Even if you reduce your calorie intake, the calories your body burns should remain the same.

This way, a calorie deficit is created, allowing the body to use fat for energy.

But in reality, it's not like that.

To reduce calorie intake, if you follow a low-calorie diet,

The calories consumed by the body will decrease.

This makes it easy to gain weight.

So when you eat less or starve yourself to lose weight, most people experience a rebound effect.

In fact, the person reduced their food intake significantly and lost weight down to 37 kg.

I have gained weight again, and now I weigh between 53 and 54 kg.

From the fact that I didn't eat foods like chicken, pizza, or tteokbokki,

I am following a diet in my own way.

I am consistently exercising for 2 to 3 hours a day.

I gained nearly 20 kg in just a few months.

I started skipping lunch at the end of the first semester of my first year in high school.

Exercising for 2 to 3 hours a day is something that happened later than that.

Then, during my third year of middle school,

I haven't exercised for 2 to 3 hours, and I also didn't skip lunch.

At that time, my weight was 56 kg.

I was maintaining a weight of 56 kg without doing anything.

By drastically limiting my food intake, my body has become prone to gaining weight.

Right now, I have to eat only one meal a day and exercise for 2 to 3 hours.

I have been able to maintain a weight of 53 to 54 kg.

It takes an enormous amount of effort to maintain a similar weight as the body changes.

That's why they say not to starve yourself to lose weight.

However, no matter how easy it has become to gain weight,

I exercise for 2 to 3 hours a day, so is it possible to gain weight?

If you consistently repeat exercise, the calories burned through exercise will decrease.

For example, by running a distance of more than 10 km every day.

traditional tribes that engage in hunting and gathering

Office workers who spend most of their day sitting.

How would the daily energy consumption of these two groups compare?

If we think simply,

A traditional tribe that engages in hunting and gathering must have a high daily energy expenditure.

However, in reality, that's not the case. There's not much difference.

He analyzed the daily calorie consumption of the Hadza people in Tanzania.

A traditional tribe that lives a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, running more than 10 kilometers every day.

The level of physical activity was tremendous.

I compared it to Westerners who spend most of their time sitting.

However, there is a difference in daily calorie consumption between the Tanzanian tribes and Westerners.

There was no difference at all.

This is the result obtained using the most accurate state-of-the-art method, the dual-labeling technique.

Why does that happen?

If the same behavior is repeated,

This is because as efficiency increases, the energy consumed decreases.

People without exercise experience don't know how to perform exercise postures.

And I don't know which muscles to engage or in what direction to apply the force.

So a considerable amount of energy is wasted. The efficiency is not good.

On the other hand, a person who exercises regularly instinctively maintains good posture while exercising.

Knowing where to apply force and in which direction to apply it.

So you can exercise efficiently without wasting energy.

However, having no wasted energy and being efficient means that

This means that the calories burned decrease when you exercise.

There is no wasted energy, and it is efficient, so it uses less energy.

So, the Haja tribe, which repeats a lifestyle of hunting and gathering,

I am accustomed to hunting and gathering, and it is efficient.

It consumes less energy per hour.

On the other hand, for office workers who spend most of their time sitting,

Because I am not used to moving my body, my efficiency is poor.

Therefore, when you move your body, you consume a lot of energy per hour.

2 x 5 and 5 x 2 both equal 10.

Although it consumes less energy per hour, it moves for a long time.

Employees who consume a lot of energy per hour but move very little.

The energy consumption levels can be similar.

It is often said that when exercising, one should apply progressive overload.

If you maintain a consistent intensity in your exercise,

Because the body adapts, the effects of exercise decrease.

It means that the intensity of exercise should be gradually increased.

The reason is because of this.

Returning to the original story.

The person in question exercises for 2 to 3 hours a day, but...

Most of the exercise consists of walking.

As your body adapts to the walking exercise, the calories you burn will decrease.

However, due to the diet that involves reducing meal portions,

The body is gradually becoming one that easily gains weight.

So I exercise for 2 to 3 hours every day and only eat one meal a day, but...

It has no significant effect.

First of all, the thing that the person who wrote in is most worried about is...

If I reduce my exercise, won't I gain weight like crazy?

You don't need to worry too much about that part.

As mentioned earlier,

The exercise that the person is doing has already become more efficient.

The calorie consumption is not high.

Therefore, even if you stop that exercise, it doesn't mean you will gain weight like crazy.

If that exercise had consumed a lot of calories in the first place,

It wouldn't have been possible to keep going for 2 to 3 hours while only eating one meal a day.

To solve the issue of the person seeking advice, there are four main things that need to be understood.

The first thing to know is that you can diet without eating less or starving yourself.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

How is it possible to lose weight without eating less or starving?

I will make sure to have a video about that principle available.

You need to have a clear understanding of this part in order to be able to diet.

The second thing you need to know is what food you should eat.

Looking at the story, even during the time when I weighed 42kg, I simply had rice cakes for breakfast.

Even at the point of exceeding 52~53 kg, it can be seen that I don't completely avoid snacks or bread.

It seems like you're only paying attention to calories, regardless of the type of food you eat.

You shouldn't do it this way.

The type of food you eat is much more important than the calories.

In the top right corner, I will have a video explaining the principles of a diet plan.

Please refer to that video.

Why the type of food you eat is more important than calories.

You need to understand what kind of food you should eat.

The third is to restore the lowered metabolism caused by eating disorders.

You need to know how to restore your body to its original state, which is prone to gaining weight.

There is a video I made in the past because a flight attendant reached out to me asking for help with their diet.

In that video, we talked about how to restore the body's metabolic rate.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

The last fourth point is to understand the purpose of exercising and to change your exercise methods.

Walking for 2 to 3 hours continuously like this is not proper exercise.

In the past, while talking about how to go from being average to being slim,

We talked about the purpose of exercise.

I will make sure the video appears in the bottom right corner.

If you watch the four videos currently on the screen in order,

How should I go about dieting?

How should I plan my diet?

Why I worried about gaining weight while still eating a little bit of bread or snacks.

You will be able to understand how and why to exercise.
