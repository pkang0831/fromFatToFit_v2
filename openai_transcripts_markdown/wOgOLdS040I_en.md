Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video about the set point, as there were questions about it in the comments.

The term "setpoint" is often used with different meanings by different people.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about the concept of set point, which refers to the weight that the body remembers.

In the second part of the video, we talked about the concept of set point, which means that the body has a target weight.

The links to the previous videos are available in the playlist at the top right.

If you want to watch the video in front, you can click to view it.

At the end of the second part of the video, there was a brief mention of the calorie diet theory that can commonly be found on the internet.

In this video, I will discuss the errors in that theory.

First, let me explain about the commonly seen diet calorie calculations on the internet.

Since 1 kg of body fat contains 7700 kcal, you need to burn 7700 kcal to lose 1 kg of body weight.

If you lose weight quickly, like 5kg or 10kg in a month, the likelihood of a rebound is high, and it's not good for your health either.

Losing about 3 kg per month through a slow diet is a healthy way to lose weight.

To lose 3 kg of weight in a month, you need to burn 23,100 kcal.

If you divide this by 30 days, it amounts to 770 kcal per day.

To burn 770 kcal in a day, you can either eat just enough to meet your basal metabolic rate and exercise hard for an hour, or...

If you don't have time to exercise, you can eat about 500 kcal less than your basal metabolic rate.

There are many stories like this.

The calorie diet theory fundamentally has a few errors.

The calories in food can vary depending on the cooking method.

It is true that a person cannot absorb 100% of the calories from the food they eat.

However, even if we exclude all these fundamental errors, the calorie diet theory would still be entirely correct.

There is a very big error in the story that has just come out.

Since 1 kg of body fat contains 7700 kcal, you need to burn 7700 kcal to lose 1 kg of weight.

This means that to lose 1 kg of weight, you need to burn 1 kg of body fat.

So, they are looking at weight and body fat in the same way.

Weight is influenced by muscle and water, so weight and body fat are not the same.

For example, if you lose 1 kg of weight by sweating in a sauna,

This is just water loss, not a loss of 1kg of body fat.

If you have increased your muscle mass through exercise and as a result, your weight has increased by 1 kg, then...

This is due to an increase of 1kg in muscle, not an increase of 1kg in body fat.

And as mentioned in the second part of the video,

When body fat decreases, the set point is set lower due to the reduced body fat.

Since weight can decrease according to the set point.

To lose 1 kg of weight, it is not necessary to burn 1 kg of body fat.

The error is at the beginning of the story, but the bigger problem is in the latter part.

Rapid weight loss is not good for your health, so losing 3 kg per month slowly is better for your health.

To lose 3 kg in a month, you need to create a daily deficit of 770 kcal.

To achieve that, you should eat only as much as your basal metabolic rate and exercise hard for an hour each day.

You should eat 500 kcal less than your basal metabolic rate.

There is nothing wrong with this calculation right now.

The energy a person consumes in a day consists of three components: basal metabolism, activity, and exercise metabolism.

The active metabolic rate is usually around 200 to 300 kcal.

When you exercise hard for one hour, the energy expenditure is about 500 kcal.

So if you eat just enough to match your basal metabolic rate and then exercise hard for an hour,

It is mathematically correct that there is a deficit of 770 kcal.

If it's difficult to exercise, it makes sense to reduce 500 kcal from your food intake, which is the amount that would have been burned through exercise.

There are no errors in the calculations, and losing 3 kg in a month is not considered a fast rate of weight loss.

Eat according to your basal metabolic rate and exercise hard for one hour a day.

Alternatively, a method to eat 500 kcal less than your basal metabolic rate.

I think that slowly dieting is a healthy approach.

This is a misunderstanding.

Because, as explained earlier,

The basic premise of all this discussion starts from the assumption that weight and body fat are the same.

This itself is wrong.

In the first place, it is not necessary to consume 1 kg of body fat to lose 1 kg of weight.

The calculations at the back are correct in themselves, but because the premise is wrong, everything becomes incorrect.

So in the second part of the stagnation video, I...

Eating only the amount of calories equivalent to your basal metabolic rate is a low-calorie diet, and it was said that this is not a healthy way to diet.

So, if you happened to see that story on the internet,

If you are someone who is dieting while enduring hunger and eating only the amount of your basal metabolic rate,

I want to let you know that you don't have to do it that way.

Sounds plausible, right?
