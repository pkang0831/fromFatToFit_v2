The topic of this video is: Does drinking alcohol alone make you gain weight?

This video is also a response to the questions that were posted in the comments.

First, let's take a look at the comments.

They say that alcohol makes you gain weight because the alcohol content in drinks converts the food in your body into fat.

In that case, does non-alcoholic beer cause less weight gain compared to regular beer?

You asked this kind of question.

First of all, alcohol itself contains calories.

In a situation where all other conditions are the same, comparing non-alcoholic drinks to regular alcoholic drinks.

Of course, regular alcohol makes you gain more weight.

However, this is a question of whether eating 100 kcal will lead to less weight gain than eating 200 kcal.

I don't think you were asking this.

It's so obvious.

So, what I think the questioner is asking is...

There are various aspects to drinking gatherings, right?

There is a saying that just drinking alcohol can make you gain weight.

No. It's said that drinking alcohol doesn't make you gain weight, but it's the snacks that cause weight gain.

I think you are asking because you are curious if there is a theory that alcohol itself causes weight gain.

As mentioned earlier, alcohol also contains calories, and food contains calories as well.

The calories in alcohol are different from the calories in food.

The most common mistake we make when talking about the calories in food

I assume that 100% of the calories from the food I eat are absorbed. However, that is not the case.

A person cannot absorb 100% of the calories from the food they eat.

After we eat food and the digestion and absorption are complete, it comes out as poop.

The reason you can use this manure as fertilizer for plants is that

Because there are nutrients in feces that our body did not absorb or could not absorb.

This nutrient is consumed by plants, allowing them to grow faster.

The fact that there are nutrients left means that there are calories left as well.

So just because I ate 1000 kcal of food, it doesn't mean that all 1000 kcal is absorbed by my body.

A certain amount is absorbed, but a certain amount is not absorbed and is excreted from the body.

What percentage of the calories from the food I ate was absorbed by my body?

This is called the absorption rate.

The absorption rate is not fixed; it changes depending on the condition of the body.

For example, if I am on a diet and I am eating less food,

The absorption rate of my body will increase.

It's natural because you need to get a lot of energy from a small amount of food.

On the contrary, if I am overeating right now, the absorption rate decreases because there is too much food.

It is often said that if you lose weight by starving yourself, you are likely to develop a body type that gains weight easily.

It is a story related to absorption rate.

If you follow a starvation diet, you have to obtain a lot of energy from a small amount of food.

The absorption rate increases.

So after the diet is over, when I eat food...

Even if you eat the same amount of food, a higher absorption rate means that more calories enter your body, leading to weight gain.

I have a video I made in the past titled "The Unfair Reasons for Fasting Diets."

The video covers this in detail.

If you're curious about the video content, there's a video link in the top right corner, so you can click on it to watch.

However, the absorption rate is applied differently to alcohol.

When food enters the body, it is not recognized as poison.

When alcohol enters the body, it is recognized as a poison.

So I'm trying to detoxify in the liver.

To metabolize alcohol, one must go through the processes of breaking it down, absorbing it, and excreting it.

In the process, the calories from alcohol are absorbed by the body.

So, when it comes to food, there is a characteristic that the absorption rate decreases when overeating.

Alcohol is recognized as a toxin by the body and is broken down, so its absorption rate is always maintained at a maximum level.

So when we consume food and alcohol with the same number of calories, more calories are absorbed into our bodies from alcohol.

And alcohol is quite high in calories at 7 kcal per gram.

However, it is said that the calories from alcohol do not convert into body fat, so they do not accumulate in the body.

It is somewhat true that the calories obtained from alcohol are not stored as fat.

In reality, most of the calories obtained from alcohol are used to raise body temperature and are lost.

So, when you drink alcohol, there is a characteristic of your body getting warmer.

Based on this, there is a theory that if you don't just eat snacks, you won't gain weight even if you drink alcohol.

There are also opposing theories.

The human body has two sources of energy: fat and carbohydrates.

Fat is stored in large amounts in the body, but it has the characteristic of not being able to drastically increase or decrease its usage.

So, in places where a constant supply of energy is needed, fat is used as an energy source.

A typical example is maintaining body temperature.

Or it is the energy used by the internal organs.

If you suddenly run or lift heavy objects, you cannot use fat for energy.

This is because such behavior occurs suddenly, and the body cannot rapidly increase the amount of fat being used.

On the contrary, carbohydrates do not have a large storage capacity in the body, but their usage can be rapidly increased or decreased.

So when the body suddenly needs a lot of energy, it first uses carbohydrates.

While carbohydrates are being used, gradually increase the amount of fat being used.

It's about swapping carbohydrates and fats.

There is a story that came out from here.

There was a famous saying in the past that you need to exercise for at least 30 minutes.

It is said that you need to exercise for more than 30 minutes for body fat to be burned.

In reality, body fat is not used at all, and it doesn't start being used after 30 minutes.

When you start exercising, the amount of body fat used gradually increases while the amount of carbohydrates used gradually decreases.

The point where usage overlaps is around 20 to 30 minutes, which is where this discussion comes from.

On the contrary, fat cannot drastically reduce its usage.

Just because your workout is over doesn't mean that fat burning stops immediately.

Even after the workout is over, body fat continues to burn for a certain period of time.

This is called the afterimage effect.

If you remember this characteristic and think about the energy of alcohol, an interesting story will unfold.

Let me summarize.

Drinking alcohol creates a large amount of calories in the body.

This calorie has the characteristic of not being able to be stored as fat.

Since I have energy, I have to use it, right?

Then where will it be used?

It is continuously used in areas of our body that require energy.

A typical example is the maintenance of body temperature and the energy of internal organs.

So when you drink alcohol, your body temperature rises and your heart rate increases.

But the important thing is, whose job was it to supply energy here?

Originally, it was the job of body fat.

Then, when the drinking party starts and I begin to gain energy from alcohol and use it,

There are situations where it is not necessary to burn body fat.

Because the necessary energy is being supplied by alcohol.

So when a drinking session starts, the usage of body fat decreases.

It is a natural phenomenon.

When a drinking session begins, the amount of body fat burned decreases, and it doesn't immediately return to normal once the drinking session ends.

As explained earlier, fat cannot be drastically increased in usage.

After the drinking session ended, I started to gradually recover.

It takes a considerable amount of time to return to the original figures.

So, it's a case of drinking alcohol without any snacks.

It is not alcohol that causes an increase in body fat.

However, if I hadn't drunk alcohol, the body fat that should have disappeared wouldn't have disappeared.

As a result, even just drinking alcohol can have a significant negative impact on dieting.

Sounds plausible, right?
