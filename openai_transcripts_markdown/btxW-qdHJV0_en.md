If a thin person receives a gut microbiome transplant, will they become a body type that does not gain weight?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the fifth video about gut microbiota.

In the first video, it is mentioned that there are countless microorganisms living in the human intestines.

This microorganism has a significant impact on our bodies and also affects obesity and dieting.

In fact, divide two groups of germ-free mice that were born via cesarean section and have never been exposed to bacteria.

One group is fed the stool of a slim person to transplant the gut microbiota of a slim individual.

In another group, they fed the feces of obese individuals to transplant the gut microbiota of obese individuals.

Mice that received gut microbiota transplants from slim individuals did not become obese.

It was said that mice that received gut microbiota transplants from obese individuals became obese.

Eating the same amount of food or

There was also an experiment where mice that received gut microbiota transplants from obese individuals were made to eat less.

Similar results were obtained in most of the experiments.

So, the composition of gut microbiota is quite important in dieting.

A comment was posted asking if one should even eat the poop of a slim person after seeing this.

Of course, it’s a comment written in jest.

There is actually a way to receive a transplant of another person's gut microbiota.

It's called fecal transplantation.

In that case, I will transplant the gut microbiota of people who can eat a lot without gaining weight into my body.

Can I also have a body type that doesn't gain weight? This question arises.

I will talk about it in detail.

First of all, when we say fecal transplantation, one might think it means putting poop into the body.

In reality, the intestinal microorganisms are extracted from the stool and directly applied inside the colon.

It uses a method of taking it as a medication.

In fact, fecal transplantation is more of a method than a diet.

Conditions related to the intestines, such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, or

It is a treatment for other serious diseases caused by intestinal microorganisms.

It actually works.

So, it is possible to treat by transplanting another person's gut microbiota into my gut.

For this purpose, there are also stool banks that store the feces of healthy individuals.

Just like blood donation, donations can also be received.

The stool of a healthy person who has passed the test can be bought for money.

Literally, even poop can turn into money.

Then, through fecal transplantation, one can become a body type that does not gain weight.

Is it possible to eat a lot like a mukbang YouTuber and not gain weight?

To put it simply, that's not the case.

It's something I always say, but our bodies change according to the environment.

This is very obvious, but it's often overlooked in dieting.

For example, in a situation where I consume 100 units of food and expend 100 units of energy,

Even if you reduce the amount of food you eat to 50,

The energy my body consumes will consistently remain at 100 without change.

Therefore, body fat will decrease by the amount of energy deficit.

The diet method that comes from this idea is a low-calorie diet.

In reality, it doesn't happen like this.

If I reduce the amount of food I eat, the energy my body consumes will also decrease.

This is commonly referred to as a decrease in basal metabolic rate.

It is considered the biggest problem of a low-calorie diet.

So, the amount of food I eat has changed because the environment has changed.

My body is changing to match that.

The same goes for gut microorganisms.

In the first place, gut microorganisms obtain their nourishment from the food I eat.

The composition of gut microorganisms changes depending on what food I eat.

That's why I kept talking about the need to change eating habits in the last video.

So even if you receive the gut microbiota of a slim person,

If my eating habits do not change, the composition of my gut microbiota will return to its original state.

In that case, the effects of the diet will disappear.

Then, you can receive a fecal transplant for gut microbiome transfer and change your eating habits.

Yes, that's right.

However, if you change your eating habits,

Even without undergoing fecal microbiota transplantation, the composition of my gut microbiota can change.

In fact, it is said that after changing eating habits and about two weeks pass, beneficial bacteria significantly increase.

So, if I don't change my eating habits,

Even if the composition of gut microbiota is changed through fecal transplantation,

If I go back to the way things were, then there is no point in receiving a fecal transplant.

If you change your eating habits

Even without undergoing fecal microbiota transplantation, the composition of gut microorganisms changes.

You will no longer need to undergo a fecal transplant.

And the most important point is that even if you undergo a fecal transplant,

There is no guarantee that you will become someone who doesn't gain weight.

Many people are looking forward to a body type that doesn't gain weight.

It means being able to eat processed foods that are not good for dieting and health without gaining weight.

A typical example is a mukbang YouTuber.

However, the reason this mukbang YouTuber does not gain weight is that factors other than gut microbiota have a greater influence.

In the first place, gut microorganisms are influenced by the food we eat.

If you eat a lot of processed foods, the composition of your gut microbiota changes negatively.

Eating a lot of processed food but not gaining weight means that

Even if the composition of gut microbiota is not good, there are other factors that prevent weight gain.

Therefore, even if you receive a transplant of that person's gut microbiota, you cannot become the same constitution.

You need to change your gut microbiota to become a body that doesn't gain weight.

Isn't the story about gut microbes meaningless?

No, that's not the case.

Many people believe that the cause of obesity is overeating, or eating too much food.

So, I think that in order to diet, you need to eat less food.

If you succeed in dieting and then eat a lot again, you will gain weight again.

I come to think that I have to eat less or manage my diet for a lifetime.

However, it's not about eating less; it's about changing the types of food you eat.

Eating processed foods increases harmful bacteria in the intestines.

Due to the influence of harmful bacteria in the gut, you can gain more weight even if you eat the same amount.

On the other hand, reducing processed foods increases beneficial bacteria in the gut.

It means that due to the influence of beneficial gut bacteria, even if you eat the same amount or more, you won't gain weight.

So, if you just change the types of food you eat,

You can diet without eating less.

It means being able to maintain a slim state.

In fact, in the comments of my video,

When I changed the types of food I eat as advised, I found that I can still lose weight even when I eat until I'm full.

There are quite a few comments that share similar experiences.

So to summarize,

People with an unhealthy composition of gut microbiota

It is possible to not lose weight even when eating less, or to gain weight.

People with a healthy composition of gut microbiota are

It is possible to eat a lot without gaining weight or even to lose weight.

There is a method called fecal transplantation, which involves receiving the gut microbiota from another person.

The composition of gut microbiota is influenced by dietary habits.

If you don't change your eating habits

Even if you receive a transplant of gut microbiota, it becomes meaningless because you return to your original state.

If you change your eating habits, you can alter the composition of your gut microbiota.

You will no longer need to undergo a fecal microbiota transplant.

So if you change the types of food you eat, the composition of your gut microbiota will change.

You can diet without eating less or starving yourself.

You can understand it to this extent.

How should I change the types of food I eat?

I talked in detail about how to change the types of food you eat in another video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

I understand that changing eating habits to alter the composition of gut microbiota is important.

I just ate processed food, so I have a lot of harmful bacteria in my gut right now.

In this state, even if you change your eating habits,

Since beneficial bacteria have to fight against harmful bacteria, it seems like they won't grow well.

You mentioned that changing eating habits for about two weeks can lead to changes in gut microbiota.

Then, either fast for about two weeks to a month or eat as little food as possible.

Starve the harmful bacteria in the gut to death.

If you eat a lot of foods that serve as food for beneficial bacteria afterwards,

Wouldn't beneficial bacteria grow much faster?

Isn't it an interesting thought? In the next video, I will talk about this.

I will make sure to have it appear in the top right corner once the next video is completed.

If the video is not completed, another video is scheduled to be released.

If the video in the upper right is not part 6 of the gut microbiome,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

Mukbang YouTubers who can eat a lot of processed food without gaining weight.

You mentioned that there are other reasons besides gut microorganisms.

Why am I not gaining weight?

The reason why mukbang YouTubers don't gain weight was a question that came up before, and I made a video about it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

However, even if you change your eating habits to improve your gut microbiota and diet,

Eating processed foods negatively affects gut microbiota and leads to weight gain, right?

So does that mean I have to eat tasteless diet food for the rest of my life?

No, that's not the case.

You don't have to eat a diet plan for your whole life, nor do you have to eat tasteless food.

This question came up before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right corner.
