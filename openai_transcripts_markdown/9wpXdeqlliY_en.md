Is the consumption of meat, sugar, flour, and instant food fatal to human aging?

To get straight to the point, the consumption of meat, sugar, flour, and instant food is

It does not directly affect human aging.

However, there are research findings that indirectly suggest it can delay or promote aging.

First of all, aging has not been fully understood yet.

There is a claim that there is only one cause of aging, but

There is also a claim that various reasons combine to accelerate the aging process.

The most attention-grabbing topic regarding aging right now is telomeres.

Telomeres are proteins that are attached to the ends of chromosomes.

Cells have a characteristic of becoming slightly shorter each time they divide.

When telomeres shorten beyond a certain length, cells stop dividing.

In that case, the number of new cells will decrease.

The period for using existing cells is extended.

This phenomenon is called aging.

Since the discovery of telomeres, research on them has been actively conducted.

As of now, there is no established technology to artificially extend or restore human telomeres.

Instead, through a survey.

The results have shown what commonalities people with relatively well-preserved telomere lengths have.

As a result of a survey conducted with thousands of participants

Individuals with relatively well-preserved telomere lengths showed two common characteristics.

The first is stress.

The second was exercise.

People who are in highly stressful environments tend to have shorter telomeres.

People who are in environments with less stress tend to have longer telomeres.

The more active a person is and the more diverse their exercise routine, the longer their telomeres are.

The shorter the telomeres were, the less likely the person was to exercise.

The more stressed a person is and the less they exercise,

The rate at which the length of telomeres is decreasing has accelerated.

The more a person exercises without feeling stressed,

This means that the rate at which telomeres shorten has decreased.

Based on the information provided so far, I will attempt to answer the questions.

In the case of meat, it provides the calories needed for exercise and the protein necessary for building muscle.

Eating has the effect of preventing aging, right?

In the case of the party, it is converted into glycogen for muscle use and glucose for use in the brain.

If you don't consume carbohydrates, you won't be able to exert strength from your muscles, which will prevent you from exercising.

You may experience stress due to a lack of glucose available for the brain.

In the case of meat and carbohydrates, consuming them to some extent can help prevent aging.

What is important here is that when consuming the meat and sugar I just mentioned in the form of processed foods like processed meats and refined sugars,

There is a problem of becoming obese.

When you become obese, your body becomes heavier, making it difficult to exercise.

For individuals with obesity who dislike their bodies, it can lead to a decrease in self-confidence and increased stress.

So among meat and sugar, refined foods become foods that promote aging.

Unrefined foods are foods that help prevent aging.

This is assuming that exercise is being done.

Lastly, in the case of instant flour, it is a refined food, so it would be considered a food that promotes aging.

However, there is someone around me who eats processed foods, is overweight, and doesn't exercise, yet still looks young.

This is a somewhat sad story.

It is the genetic differences in aging that each person has.

Let's assume that we can quantify aging in a way that makes it easy to understand.

A, who was born with the number 10,

If you eat processed foods and don't exercise, the number that is 10 will rise to 15.

B, who is genetically born with 30,

Even if I eat unrefined foods and exercise to lower this figure to 25,

It's higher compared to A's 15, isn't it?

So if the genetic differences are significant, no matter how hard B tries to take care of themselves, they will age faster than A.

So, does that mean that diet and exercise are not meaningless?

That is not it.

I have an acquaintance who really likes Kang Daniel.

So, if I work hard on my diet and exercise, can I become Kang Daniel?

It doesn't work.

No matter how hard I try, I cannot become Kang Daniel.

Since I can't become Kang Daniel, does that mean my diet and exercise are meaningless?

That's not the case, is it?

It's better to set your standards for yourself rather than for others.

In the days when I ate processed foods and didn't exercise, I was very obese; I was overweight and looked older.

If I compare my past self with the present me, who eats unrefined foods and exercises,

I definitely feel younger.

You have definitely become a bit more handsome.

Compared to how I was back then, I've become more handsome.

Just think about it really simply.

If I don't take care of myself, I will look older than I do now.

The reference point is me.

If I take care of myself, I will look younger than I do now.

I will summarize.

Eating unrefined foods and engaging in appropriate exercise helps preserve the length of telomeres.

If the length of telomeres is preserved, it can slow down the aging process.

Sounds plausible, right?
