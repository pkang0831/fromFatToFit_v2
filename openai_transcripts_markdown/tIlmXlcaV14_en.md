The topic of this video is about fruit juice and dried fruit.

This video is also a response to the questions that were posted in the comments.

First, I will read the content of the comments.

I'm really enjoying your videos, pkang. I have a question about fruits.

I understood that it's okay to eat fruits.

Drink fruit as juice or

Is it okay to eat dried fruit without adding anything?

I'm curious if you're only recommending general fresh fruits.

You left a comment like this.

I have a video I made in the past that explains why fruits do not make you gain weight.

You watched this video and left a question.

If you're curious about the video content, the video link is displayed in the top right corner, so you can click on it to watch.

To put it simply, it is not something that you should absolutely avoid eating.

However, you need to be careful about the amount you eat.

In the video about eating fruits without gaining weight, it was mentioned that you don't need to worry about the amount you eat.

Fruits do not make you gain weight.

This is because fruits contain fructose, and it is known that eating a lot of them can lead to weight gain.

Most fruits are composed of water.

Fruits themselves have a low content of carbohydrates and calories.

So even if I eat a lot, I stop before reaching the point of becoming obese because I feel full.

So I said that you can eat comfortably without worrying about the amount.

However, fruit juice and dried fruit are different matters.

First, let's talk about fruit juice.

When we eat food, our body consumes time and energy to digest it.

For example, if you ate brown rice,

Our bodies need to spend time and energy to break down the husk of brown rice.

After melting the shell and breaking down the resulting white rice, you can obtain nutrients only after spending time and energy on the process.

However, white rice porridge made by crushing white rice, which is the peeled version of brown rice, is...

Since the skin has already been removed and the rice grains are also crushed,

It has the characteristic of being digested and absorbed very quickly when eaten.

The food that is prepared by doing the digestive work our body needs to do in advance is called refined food.

Fruit juice is made by either blending whole fruits or extracting the liquid using a juicer.

These two tasks are originally the digestive processes that our body should perform.

Because this was done outside, fruit juice can be considered a processed food.

So it's easy to eat a large amount, and digestion and absorption are quick.

I will make a comparison to make it easier to understand.

If you blend 4 apples without adding anything, you will make apple juice.

It is enough to fill one 500ml water bottle.

Eating four apples by yourself is quite a lot.

However, 500ml of juice is not an overwhelming amount to drink.

So I can eat apples without worrying about how much I eat.

If I eat 1 or 2, I get full and stop eating.

If you make it into a juice, you can consume a much larger amount than that.

Dried fruit has not been ground or pressed.

The time and energy required for digestion remain the same.

However, because it was dried, the moisture content is very low.

The weight of the flesh of a typical medium-sized banana, after peeling, is about 100g.

If you turn this 100g banana into dried banana, the weight will reduce to 20g.

It means that 80g of a banana was water.

The issue with this is that...

A bag of snacks that can be easily found at a convenience store typically has a capacity of about 140g.

A bag of snacks is easy to eat, right?

People who eat well can consume 2 to 3 bags, but I will use just 1 bag as the standard.

I want to eat dried bananas as easily as I eat potato chips. So, I ate about 140g.

To make 140g of dried bananas, you need 7 fresh bananas.

So if you eat dried bananas like a snack, it's equivalent to eating about 7 bananas.

If I eat bananas as a snack, I usually have 2, and even if I eat a lot, I stop at 3 or 4 because I feel full.

However, when I made it with dried bananas, I ate it just like a bag of snacks for a moment.

I ate about the amount of 7 bananas.

Because 80% of the total volume of the banana, which is water, has been lost.

This means that the volume has decreased, allowing you to eat more.

I will summarize.

If you eat fruits in their whole form, there is no need to limit the amount you consume.

Because it is rich in fiber and has a high water content

Before eating so much that I become obese, I stop eating because I feel full.

However, if you make it with fruit juice or dried fruit,

Because the fiber is destroyed and moisture evaporates.

The effect of not being able to eat enough to become obese disappears.

So it becomes possible to eat enough to become obese.

If you want to eat fruit juice or dried fruit, you shouldn't keep eating them just because you want to enjoy them without worry.

You need to limit the amount to a certain extent that I will eat.

Sounds plausible, right?
