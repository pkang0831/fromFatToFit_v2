The topic of this video is what happens when you follow a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Will there be problems due to a lack of carbohydrates?

When talking about a low-carb, high-fat diet, this question always follows.

I've heard that eating fewer carbohydrates can cause side effects. Is that okay?

In fact, among the comments on the low-carb, high-fat diet video I created,

If you continue with a low-carb, high-fat diet, it's said that a lack of carbohydrates can be harmful to your body. Are you going to keep it up? This question is being asked.

I will talk about this in detail.

If we search the internet, there is a lot of information about the benefits and side effects of food.

Some foods have these benefits, so eating them in large amounts is good for your health.

Some foods have side effects like this, so eating them in large quantities is not good for your health.

Most of this information does not explain exactly how much you need to eat to experience those effects and side effects.

Will I see benefits if I eat 100g a day?

Or do you need to eat 1kg to see the effects?

It just says vaguely, "if you eat a lot."

The problem with this method of information delivery is that

Some foods have beneficial effects, but to see those benefits, you need to eat 1 kg of them a day.

When you say just eat a lot, it means eating 100g or 200g a day.

Some people might think, "There must be such benefits, right?"

It was said that some foods are not good for your health if you eat too much of them.

To eat an amount that would cause abnormalities in the body, one would need to consume 1kg or 2kg per day.

They say it's unhealthy food and try not to even put it in their mouth.

This is clearly incorrect information, and

People who receive this kind of information may encounter errors.

The same goes for the low-carb diet.

It is true that eating too few carbohydrates can lead to health issues.

I do not deny this statement itself.

However, there are very few people who know exactly how much less one should eat before experiencing issues with their body.

I just vaguely heard that "eating fewer carbohydrates is not good for the body."

That low-carb diet? You mean eating fewer carbohydrates? You think it's not good for your health, right?

There is something called the half-bowl diet.

Eating regular meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner is the same.

When eating, you only eat half of the rice.

It's a very common method of dieting.

When it comes to this diet, no one worries about a lack of carbohydrates.

Some people believe that following a low-carb, high-fat diet can lead to health issues due to a lack of carbohydrates.

To someone who eats half a bowl of rice.

Eating only half a bowl of rice instead of a full bowl can lead to a lack of carbohydrates, which may cause health issues. This is something that isn't often talked about.

In that case, if you eat half a bowl of rice for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, that adds up to one and a half bowls of rice in total for the day.

It is a common perception that eating this amount will not lead to a carbohydrate deficiency problem.

Then, how much is this?

One bowl of rice is based on 300g.

There are 70g of carbohydrates in 300g of rice.

Since half a bowl of rice is 150g, it contains about 35g of carbohydrates.

Since I eat this three times a day, the amount of carbohydrates I consume from rice would be about 105g.

If we assume that we eat a little more side dishes here, we would be consuming about 120 to 130 grams of carbohydrates in total.

If you consume this amount of carbohydrates, it means there are no health issues.

You should consume that amount through fruits and vegetables.

If you consume the lacking calories through meat here,

You can follow a low-carb, high-fat diet without experiencing issues from a lack of carbohydrates.

A low-carb, high-fat diet doesn't necessarily mean that you have to eat very little carbohydrates, which can lead to problems.

Of course, there is such a diet, but that's just one type among the various kinds of low-carb, high-fat diets.

I hope you don't think that a low-carb, high-fat diet is one that causes issues due to a lack of carbohydrates.
