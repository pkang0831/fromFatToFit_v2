We binge ate together, but my friend doesn't gain weight while I do. Why is that?

I binge ate with my friend, but why is my friend fine while I’m the only one gaining weight?

A question with this kind of content has been posted in the comments, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's take a look at the comments.

Hello, I am a woman in my mid-twenties.

I went on a trip with a friend this time and had a strange experience, so I have a question to ask.

My friend and I grew up together since we were young, and both of us were on the chubby side.

So we tried dieting together a lot, but we often failed or experienced yo-yo effects.

About two years ago, a friend of mine succeeded in losing weight.

I watched pkang's video and changed my diet method, and I was recommended that it was successful.

So I recently started my diet while watching pkang's videos.

Then, I ended up going on a trip with a friend.

Both my friend and I love to eat, so when we travel, we tend to focus a lot on food.

During my travels, I stopped dieting and ate a lot of different things.

Both of them came back after binge eating like crazy.

I have gained quite a bit of weight, but my friend has hardly changed.

They say that although they gained a little weight, they returned to their original weight in just 2 or 3 days.

We grew up together since we were young, and both of us gained weight, so we also went on a diet.

I don't think it's true that some people can eat a lot and not gain weight.

The comment says, "But why did I gain weight?"

It can be frustrating and make you curious.

I will try to explain why that is.

To put it simply, it's because of homeostasis.

Homeostasis is the characteristic of regulating variables to maintain a stable and constant internal environment.

Simply put, it is a characteristic of wanting to maintain the current state as it is.

In dieting, we mainly talk about the factors that hinder the diet.

I am currently obese, so I am trying to lose weight.

The homeostasis that seeks to maintain the current state also tries to sustain a state of obesity.

So even if you work hard on your diet and exercise, it means that the diet may not go well.

However, if we think about it from a different perspective,

When I am in a state of obesity, homeostasis always interferes with my diet.

If I can be in a state of not being obese.

This means that homeostasis has the effect of preventing obesity.

Homeostasis is the characteristic of wanting to maintain the current state.

Therefore, if my current state is not obesity, I will try to maintain that non-obese state.

There is a quite interesting experiment that can confirm this.

A study was conducted with 14 healthy young men aged 24 to 37.

After eating pizza to the limit

We conducted an experiment to observe changes in blood sugar, blood lipids, and hormones including insulin in the participants.

The change didn't seem significant compared to the amount I ate.

How much pizza did you eat?

Aren't they all people who keep in touch? Didn't you just eat a little pizza?

No, that's not the case.

In the first phase, participants were allowed to eat pizza freely until they felt full.

The average amount eaten by 14 people was one large pizza per person.

When I was asked to eat until I could no longer eat on the second plate.

On average, each person ate one more large pizza.

So, if we take what we've eaten up to the limit as the standard...

On average, each person ate 2 large pizzas.

This is not a small amount.

In the first round, on average, we ate one large pizza.

On average, we ate two large pizzas in the second round.

So, compared to the first round, the intake of carbohydrates and fats increased by two times in the second round.

However, there were no significant changes observed in blood sugar, blood lipids, and hormones including insulin.

Of course, there was a slight increase, but it was negligible compared to the amount consumed.

So, if my current condition is not obesity, then...

Even if you overeat or binge eat just once,

This means that because homeostasis provides a defense, it doesn't mean that one will gain weight immediately.

If you look at the testimonials of people who have actually succeeded in dieting,

Even if you eat foods commonly referred to as fattening or overeat, binge eat,

It is said that weight does not immediately increase, but rather that it is maintained to some extent.

Of course, there are cases where body weight increases by a few kilograms due to an increase in body water.

It wasn't that body fat increased in the first place.

In about 2 to 3 days, the body water will decrease, and you will return to your original weight.

After seeing this, they say that their body has changed and that they no longer gain weight even when they eat.

So what about people who succeed in dieting but then experience a rebound?

If you weren't obese in the first place, shouldn't your body maintain homeostasis and not gain weight?

It goes without saying that homeostasis has its limits.

Looking back at the subjects from the previous experiment,

The subjects of the experiment were healthy men aged 24 to 37 who were not obese.

In a healthy state, not being obese means that occasional overeating or binge eating is not a problem.

The same goes for people who have succeeded in dieting.

In a healthy state after successfully dieting, occasional overeating or binge eating is not a problem.

On the contrary, if you lose weight through a low-calorie diet or by starving yourself, but your body is not in a healthy state, then...

The yo-yo can come right away.

And if you consistently overeat or binge eat, rather than just occasionally, it disrupts homeostasis and causes problems.

In reality, there are very few people who are aware of the entire process that led them to become obese.

I ate foods that make you gain weight, and I overate and binge ate, but I didn't gain as much weight as I expected, so I became complacent.

At some point, you realize that you have become obese.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

The first person's body has a response called homeostasis, which aims to maintain the current state.

If a person is not currently obese, homeostasis can help prevent obesity.

All of this is based on a healthy person.

So, the writer's friend has become sufficiently healthy.

Therefore, even if you occasionally overeat or binge while traveling, it is not really a problem.

On the contrary, the person in question is still in an unhealthy state where their obesity has not been resolved.

Therefore, when you go on a trip and overeat or binge eat, it becomes a problem.

If you, like a friend, diet in the right way,

Even if you occasionally overeat or binge eat, you can have a body that is not affected by it.

Please hang in there a little longer.

So how do you follow the right diet?

I talked in detail about the principles and methods of dieting in another video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

There is a significant difference between women's diets and men's diets.

There are quite a few cases where people diet without recognizing this difference.

So I often get confused.

If a woman is going on a diet, there are two important things she must know.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right, so if you're a woman, please be sure to check them out.

I usually don't have much of an appetite.

When I decide to go on a diet, I suddenly develop cravings that I didn't have before, and it's driving me crazy.

Why is that?

It is due to the perception of meal quantity and calories.

I previously made a video explaining in detail why that question came up.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.
