A person who lost 10kg in a month by drinking vinegar and someone who didn't - Vinegar Part 4

This is the fourth video about vinegar.

In the first video, I talked about the principle of whether just drinking vinegar can lead to weight loss.

In the second video, we talked about how to use vinegar in dieting.

In the third video, we talked about whether the effects of vinegar differ by type.

In this video, I would like to discuss the reasons why the effects of vinegar vary from person to person.

The most famous vinegar for the vinegar diet in Korea is pineapple vinegar.

There are people who say they lost 10 kg in a month by drinking pineapple vinegar.

Some people have reported that even after drinking pineapple vinegar, there was no change in their weight.

The reason for this difference is due to the various effects of vinegar.

Vinegar has the effect of slowing down the rate at which blood sugar rises, but

It promotes intestinal movement and also has the effect of removing lactic acid components.

This can lead to significant weight loss.

First, promoting intestinal movement can help resolve constipation.

As constipation is resolved and stool is expelled from the body, weight will decrease accordingly.

However, the feeling of my body becoming lighter is much stronger than the weight loss.

People with constipation often feel a heaviness in their lower abdomen and a very heavy sensation in their body.

When constipation is resolved, you feel a significant lightness in your body.

So even if there is no significant change in actual weight,

I feel like I've lost a lot of weight.

My body has become very light.

So there are cases where the weight loss effects of vinegar are exaggerated.

Such symptoms of constipation are much more common in women than in men.

That's why women show more interest in vinegar diets than men.

The removal of the second lactic acid component has the effect of reducing swelling.

When we use our muscles a lot, lactic acid builds up.

This can also cause muscle pain.

It can cause swelling by increasing body water content.

When swelling causes an increase in body water, body weight increases by the amount of weight of the body water.

When the body swells, it looks thicker, so it will appear to have gained weight accordingly.

Removing lactic acid with vinegar can reduce muscle soreness and alleviate swelling.

When the swelling goes down, the body water decreases, and the weight decreases by the amount of water lost.

As the swelling goes down, the body becomes slimmer.

So, in the case of people with severe constipation and swelling,

Drinking vinegar can lead to significant weight loss.

However, this effect does not continue indefinitely.

Once the constipation is resolved and everything has been expelled, there will be no more stool to pass.

Once the lactic acid decreases and the swelling is resolved, there will be no more excess body fluid to be released.

So in the early stages, when there is a lot of waste and water, weight decreases rapidly.

Once the waste and moisture have been sufficiently eliminated, there will be no change in weight.

So, I drank vinegar and lost 10 kg in the first month.

This means that losing 10 kg next month is not guaranteed.

And in the first place, people who do not have severe constipation and swelling...

Even if you drink vinegar, you may not lose weight.

So I drank the same pineapple vinegar, but...

Some people lose a lot of weight, while others lose just a little.

I don't have constipation and I don't exercise.

Since there is no constipation, there is no stool to pass.

It's probably not just because I haven't been exercising that lactic acid has built up a lot. I've also lost a lot of weight.

When you use your muscles a lot, lactic acid builds up, and this lactic acid causes swelling.

Hearing this story makes me think of exercise most of the time.

A typical action that uses a lot of muscles is exercise.

Just because we don't exercise doesn't mean we don't use our muscles.

In fact, people who do not exercise may accumulate lactic acid more severely due to weaker muscles.

I talked about it in detail in the lower body obesity series before.

If the muscles are weak, posture becomes unstable.

If you live with an unstable posture, you will need to balance yourself.

I am excessively using my thighs and calves.

Because of this, the front part of my thigh sticks out.

I mentioned that the calves develop a lot.

In this situation, I am not exercising.

Muscles in specific areas like the thighs and calves are being used a lot.

This can lead to the accumulation of lactic acid and cause swelling.

If a person like this drinks vinegar, it will help reduce swelling.

You may also experience weight loss and your legs becoming slimmer.

So, can drinking only vinegar solve lower body obesity?

No, that's not the case.

Vinegar can only provide assistance; it cannot offer a solution.

The root of the problem is that the muscles are weak, leading to poor posture.

This is why the balance is off.

Then we need to solve that problem. Just drinking vinegar won't solve the issue.

I talked about this in detail in the lower body obesity series.

The lower body obesity series is linked at the top right, so it's going out.

Refer to that video to maintain proper posture while exercising, as it can be helpful.

I was planning to wrap up this video as the last one about vinegar, but...

It's really hard to eat vinegar without sugar.

I'm not sure whether vinegar should be taken before or after a meal.

When should I eat this?

I see a lot of comments asking this kind of question.

In the next video, we will discuss when to drink vinegar and how to drink it.

So far, summarize the content of the video.

I will talk about the benefits of vinegar according to different situations and then conclude.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the vinegar part 5 video, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
