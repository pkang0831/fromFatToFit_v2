Do people who have been obese for a long time lose weight slowly?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

In Korea, there is a saying called "quick gain, quick loss."

The weight gained quickly is lost quickly.

In that case, does fat that has been gained slowly over a long period of time also come off slowly?

Does a longer period of obesity mean that dieting takes longer?

A question with this kind of content has been posted in the comments, so I would like to discuss it.

First of all, the concept of rapid weight gain and loss is somewhat accurate if we consider it based on weight.

After eating a lot of holiday food during the holiday break, I gained 5 kg in just a few days.

At the end of the year, there are many drinking parties for year-end gatherings, and I've heard that some people gain 5kg in just a few days.

There are cases where weight can increase in a short period of time.

The cause is mostly due to moisture.

The food we eat contains carbohydrates and sodium.

Carbohydrates and sodium have the effect of increasing body water.

If you eat more food than usual, you will consume more carbohydrates and sodium than usual.

If you consume a larger amount of carbohydrates and sodium than usual, your body water will also increase accordingly.

When body water increases, body weight also increases by that amount.

It's not fat, but water, which is why weight can increase in a short period of time.

On the contrary, because it is water, it is also possible to lose weight in a short period of time.

In reality, weight gained from body water increases will return to normal within a few days to a maximum of 1 to 2 weeks.

However, weight that has gradually increased over a long period of time is often more fat than water.

For example, if your weight has increased by 5 kg over the course of a year,

This is likely an increase in body fat rather than body water.

Unlike body water, which can increase or decrease rapidly,

Body fat does not increase quickly, nor does it decrease quickly.

So, to lose this body fat, more time is needed than for water.

So if we only talk about the time it takes for weight to change,

Weight gained quickly is lost quickly, and weight gained slowly is lost slowly.

However, this phenomenon occurs because the causes of weight gain differ between water and fat.

It's not because quickly accumulated body fat burns off quickly, and slowly accumulated body fat burns off slowly.

Whether it accumulates quickly or slowly, there is not much difference in the rate at which body fat decreases when dieting.

So, whether someone has been obese for 1 year or 10 years, there is no difference in dieting?

When following the same diet, this is how the rate of body fat reduction is.

However, the longer the period of being overweight, the more difficult it becomes to diet.

Basically, our bodies are determined by our eating habits and lifestyle.

I have a habit of liking and frequently eating foods that make me gain weight.

If you enjoy lying down and have a lifestyle that involves not moving much,

Of course, you will gain weight and become obese.

My body being obese means that I have unhealthy eating habits and lifestyle choices.

To diet, you need to improve your eating habits and lifestyle.

The problem is that the longer the period of obesity, the harder it is to improve eating and lifestyle habits.

For example, I changed jobs to another company.

I was under a lot of stress at my new job.

Let's say that to relieve stress, you started drinking alcohol after work.

When the alcohol consumed after work leads to an increase in body fat and results in obesity.

If that point is about a year.

Originally, I didn't often drink alcohol after work.

I drank because of stress when I changed companies a year ago, and that's why I gained weight.

I think I should reduce my alcohol intake to diet.

However, if this kind of life continues for 10 years,

I originally became someone who drinks after work, and it's become very difficult to change this.

To make it easier to understand, I used alcohol as an example.

The same applies to eating habits and lifestyle habits.

I originally like snacks and cake.

I usually eat a lot of food.

I originally like lying down.

When you have such thoughts,

I know that dieting requires a proper diet and exercise, but...

Starting that diet itself becomes difficult.

And even if you force yourself to start, it's often the case that you quickly return to your original lifestyle.

I originally liked snacks and cakes.

I can temporarily give it up for dieting, but I can't endure it for a lifetime.

Then, even if you work hard now and succeed in your diet,

In the end, I'll end up gaining weight again by eating snacks and cake.

What does this mean? That's what I'm thinking.

However, the feelings of food cravings and dislike for exercise that I am experiencing right now are

It is because it has been influenced by my eating habits, lifestyle, or physical condition.

When I change my body through dieting, my thoughts also begin to change.

In the past, I really loved snacks and cakes.

Since starting my diet, I haven't been eating well.

In the past, I disliked exercising, but as I continued to do it regularly, I have come to enjoy it.

The thoughts I have while being in a state of obesity.

I hope you don't think it will stay the same even after you go on a diet.

When the body changes, the mind changes too.

It's not a good dieting method, but I have experience losing weight by starving myself.

Even if I diet like that, I still want to eat snacks and cake.

No, it actually makes me more obsessed.

Starving yourself to lose weight can also have an impact on your body.

It’s possible that I ended up liking snacks and cake even more because I lost weight by starving myself.

One of my subscribers is a flight attendant, and they have had the same experience.

I received a request for help and even made a response video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos displayed in the top left.

When you lose weight by starving yourself, why does an obsession with snacks and cake develop?

If you are curious about how to solve that problem, you can click here to see.

So just because someone is on a diet, it doesn't mean that everyone will have the same results.

If you lose weight by starving yourself, it can actually increase your cravings.

If you diet the right way, your cravings will decrease, right?

What is the correct way to diet?

I previously made a video explaining the principles of dieting in detail.

I will have related videos appear in the top right, so if you're curious, you can click and watch them.

Lastly, I don't want to eat only a lifelong diet plan. I don't have the confidence to exercise for a lifetime.

Many people have been talking about this, so I made a video to respond.

I will set it up so that the diet appears in the bottom left and the exercise videos appear in the bottom right.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
