The reason we become obese is that we eat too much food.

Therefore, if you are dieting, it is natural to reduce the amount of food you eat.

However, if you eat too little, a hunger response will occur.

The hunger response is a reaction that helps ensure survival in situations where food is scarce.

Lowering the basal metabolic rate to reduce the energy the body consumes.

It has the characteristic of storing as much of the food consumed as possible as body fat.

Simply put, it's becoming harder to diet and easier to gain weight.

Due to this hunger response, most people experience a rebound effect when they follow a low-calorie diet or lose weight by starving themselves.

So if you eat too much, you'll gain weight.

If you eat too little, you might experience a rebound effect.

You should eat neither too much nor too little; that's the best approach for dieting.

What is the right amount of food that is neither too much nor too little? That's the issue.

How much food should I eat for dieting?

To resolve this question, many people choose to calculate calories.

Calculate the basal metabolic rate considering gender, height, weight, and age.

Calculate the calories of the food I eat.

It's a method of eating only as much as your basal metabolic rate.

Since I eat at least my basal metabolic rate, it's not a low-calorie diet.

Therefore, it is expected that there will be no hunger response and no yo-yo effect.

In reality, it is not like that.

There are two main reasons.

The first reason is that the energy we consume in a day is not solely based on our basal metabolic rate.

For a person to live, organs like the brain, heart, liver, and lungs must be actively functioning.

The energy consumed to maintain life in this way is called the basal metabolic rate.

However, we are not just maintaining our lives and staying still, right?

I engage in activities to go to school or work.

Activities like this also consume energy.

The energy consumed during these everyday activities is called the activity metabolic rate.

The energy expended through exercise is called exercise metabolic rate.

So, basal metabolic rate, active metabolic rate, exercise metabolic rate.

The total daily energy expenditure, which is the sum of these three metabolic rates, is the energy we use in a day.

If you only eat enough to meet your basal metabolic rate, you will lack the energy needed for activities and exercise, which can lead to problems.

So, if you eat enough to cover your basal metabolic rate plus your activity and exercise metabolic rates, isn't that enough?

The active metabolic rate is said to be about 20% to 30% of the basal metabolic rate.

You can find information about exercise metabolism online.

Yes, that's right.

The calories burned through exercise are well-documented online for each type of exercise.

The basal metabolic rate does vary somewhat depending on the level of activity.

For office workers, it is about 20-30% of the basal metabolic rate.

The value obtained through this calculation is not completely accurate, but...

It's not a big problem because we can get roughly similar values.

The problem is that the calculated value is different from the actual value.

This is the second problem.

Many people believe that eating food with 500 calories...

I think about how 500 calories must have entered my body.

In reality, it is not like that.

In the first place, a person cannot absorb 100% of the calories from the food they eat.

If a person could absorb 100% of the calories from the food they eat,

When consuming foods with similar nutritional components, like brown rice and white rice, there should be no difference if eaten in the same calorie amount.

So, if a person who used to eat 300 calories of white rice switches to eating 300 calories of brown rice instead,

Although white rice has been replaced with brown rice, the nutritional components themselves are similar.

The calories consumed are the same at 300 calories, so there should be no difference.

But in reality, it's not like that.

In reality, it works as a diet.

The husk of brown rice and the components contained within it hinder digestion and absorption.

So even though the same calories are consumed, the amount absorbed by the body from brown rice is less compared to white rice.

So even if the calories are the same, the amount that is digested and absorbed varies depending on the food.

The calories burned through activities and exercise are not fixed values.

For example, it is said that a light one-hour run burns about 400 to 500 calories.

If you consistently repeat running, your body will adapt to it.

The calories burned are decreasing.

So, you can calculate the calories in food, but...

Not all the calories consumed are absorbed by the body, which leads to discrepancies.

It is possible to calculate the calories burned through activities or exercise, but...

How many times you have repeated that activity and exercise, and how accustomed your body is to it.

This means that there will be discrepancies because the calories consumed change accordingly.

Because this error is quite large, many things that don't make sense occur in calculations.

In reality, I eat only 500 calories a day and do exercise that burns 500 calories.

There are people whose weight does not change at all.

It doesn't make sense mathematically.

The 500 calories I consumed were completely burned off through exercise, so I have no choice but to use body fat.

Then, of course, body fat will decrease.

When body fat decreases, body weight should also decrease.

That's not the case.

In addition to this, it is said that the basal metabolic rate for women in their 20s is around 1300 to 1500 calories.

In that case, even if you have a meal of 1300 to 1500 calories,

Since there are active metabolic rates and exercise metabolic rates, I should be losing weight.

When you try it yourself, it's not like that, so there are many women who try to eat less.

There is no problem with the calculation itself, but there is a significant difference from the actual value.

I understand that the calculated value and the actual value are different, but...

So what should I do?

The reason we ended up calculating and eating in the first place is...

I want to know how much food my body needs right now.

However, this is not something that needs to be calculated to know.

There is a being that knows exactly how much food my body needs and tells me.

It's right in the body.

The human body has a signaling system that indicates the amount of food needed.

When you need food, you feel hunger.

When you eat enough food, you start to feel full.

So, are you saying that if I'm hungry, I should eat, and if I'm full, I shouldn't eat?

If you eat like that, you'll gain weight.

Yes, that's right. The reason we started calculating calories in the first place is...

It's because I ate whatever I wanted and gained weight, leading to obesity.

But something seems off.

All living beings, including humans, evolve in forms that are advantageous for survival.

Eating an excessive amount of food to the point of obesity is not a favorable form for survival.

Obesity itself creates various diseases, which is detrimental to survival.

So, in order to be advantageous for survival,

Before becoming obese from eating, I should want to stop eating.

Why do I keep wanting to eat to the point of becoming obese?

This is because there has been confusion in the signaling system that indicates the amount of food needed.

Foods that obese people often eat are

There is a characteristic of producing an excessive amount of the hormone called insulin.

If the insulin hormone is produced in excess,

I often develop a strong desire to eat a lot of food.

So it's not that I need food and want to eat.

It's because of the insulin hormone that you start to feel hungry.

This is referred to as cravings or false hunger.

I don't need food, but I want to eat, so I'm saying it's fake.

If you eat food based on this false hunger,

I didn't need the food, but I ate it, so it becomes overeating.

If this overeating is repeated consistently, it will gradually increase body fat and lead to obesity.

So, the reason we became obese in the first place is...

It's because I unknowingly kept overeating due to false hunger.

If you eliminate this false hunger, the problem will be solved.

However, I don't know about false hunger.

Eating whatever you want can lead to obesity.

The perception that one shouldn't eat whatever they want has emerged.

So, I started calculating calories to eat accordingly.

If you change the types of food you eat to eliminate false hunger and normalize your body's metabolism,

Because the false hunger has disappeared, I feel truly hungry when I actually need food.

The food eaten at such times is not a problem at all.

Obese people tend to keep eating even when they are full if there is food left.

There is a saying that slim people stop eating when they are full, even if there is food left.

This is the difference between having false hunger and not having it.

Even if there is food left, it is natural for me to stop eating when I am full.

The body is originally like that.

However, in a state of false hunger, one cannot stop it.

That's the problem.

So to summarize,

Because of false hunger, I can't trust the signals from my body.

I often ignore the signals from my body and eat by calculating calories.

There is a significant difference between the calculated value and the actual value.

So I have no intention of following a low-calorie diet, but...

Without realizing it, I often end up on a low-calorie diet, which lowers my basal metabolic rate and leads to a yo-yo effect.

This is one of the reasons why many people fail at dieting.

To solve this problem, eliminate false hunger to normalize the body's signals.

You should eat according to that normal signal.

By doing that, you can diet while eating enough to feel full and not hungry.

You can also prevent the yo-yo effect.

But isn't it true that you have to eat less to lose weight?

You need to eat less, so that your body uses fat according to the deficiency.

You need to use body fat; that's how dieting works as body fat decreases.

Many people think that way, but in reality, it is not so.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make a video explaining why body fat decreases even when you don't eat less, positioned at the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click here to see it.

You said to change the types of food I eat so that I don't experience false hunger.

How do you do that?

You can replace refined foods with unrefined foods.

I previously made a video explaining refined and unrefined foods.

I will make sure to have a video about unprocessed food appear in the top right.

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

However, changing the types of food you eat...

Commonly known diet foods.

So you're saying I should eat something really tasteless?

Ah... I don't want to eat that.

When asked to change the type of food you eat, many people interpret it as being told to eat tasteless food.

It's not saying that you should eat tasteless food. You can enjoy your meal!

It simply means to change the types of food you eat.

Why do we associate diet food with tasteless food in the bottom left corner?

I will make a video explaining why you can still lose weight while eating delicious food.

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

Earlier in the video, you mentioned that repeating exercises reduces the calories burned.

Why is that?

When you repeat the same exercise, your body becomes accustomed to it, and gradually your efficiency improves.

I made a video about this before as well.

Why does the number of calories burned decrease when repeating the same exercise, as seen in the bottom right?

I will make sure to have a video explaining it ready.

If you're curious about this, you can choose to take a look.
