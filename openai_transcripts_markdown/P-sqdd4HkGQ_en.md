Hello, this is pkang.

This is a video responding to a comment like the following.

Please pause the screen and check the comment content.

I believe that a vegetarian diet is healthier because meat is harmful to health for four reasons.

In summary, the comments argue that meat consumption is harmful to health for the following four reasons.

1. There are some essential nutrients, including carbohydrates, that are missing.

2. High levels of fat and cholesterol can lead to blood circulation problems.

3. Fat takes a long time to be used as energy.

4. Compared to omnivores, humans have a smaller amount of gastric juice and a longer intestine.

These four points are something that those who have watched my videos a lot would know, but I have already answered them in other videos.

However, since it is scattered across multiple videos,

Combine everything to create a video.

I thought it would be good to recommend this video if similar comments about meat keep coming up, so I created it.

1. Meat does not contain essential nutrients, including carbohydrates.

It is true that meat lacks several essential nutrients, including carbohydrates.

However, this can be easily resolved by eating vegetables or fruits that contain carbohydrates and essential nutrients.

This is actually not a point of criticism... The reason I am pointing this out is that

Vegetarianism involves not consuming animal products and only eating plant-based foods.

The misunderstanding arises from thinking that a carnivorous diet means eating only animal products without consuming any plant-based foods.

Since the stance is that one can eat both animal-based and plant-based foods, there is no problem with carnivorism.

On the contrary, vegetarian diets lack essential nutrients such as fats and essential fatty acids that are necessary for our bodies.

From this perspective, a vegetarian diet may actually be unhealthy.

2. It causes blood circulation problems due to high levels of fat and cholesterol.

Excess body fat and cholesterol accumulated in the body can indeed cause problems with blood circulation.

However, the reason for the accumulation of body fat and cholesterol is not solely due to meat consumption.

If the cause of obesity and cholesterol is meat consumption, then vegetarians who do not eat meat should not be obese.

However, among vegetarians,

People who follow a vegetarian diet consisting of refined carbohydrates like sugar, flour, and white rice are obese.

On the contrary, those who eat meat but reduce their intake of refined carbohydrates are

Body fat decreases, leading to weight loss, and cholesterol levels drop.

So, the cause of the excessive accumulation of fat and cholesterol in the body, which can lead to blood circulation problems, is

It's not meat, but refined carbohydrates.

3. Fat takes a long time to be used as energy.

The expression "it takes a long time" is ambiguous.

If the time mentioned here refers to the rate at which energy consumption increases, then it is correct.

It is true that it takes longer for fat to increase energy expenditure compared to carbohydrates.

The human body stores two types of energy.

The first is carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates have the characteristic of being able to increase usage very quickly.

To borrow an expression from the comments, it takes a short amount of time to be used as energy.

Instead, the storage capacity is not very large.

So, it is compared to newspaper, which catches fire easily but burns out quickly.

In the case of fat, it has the exact opposite characteristics.

While it may not be possible to quickly increase usage, it has the characteristic of having a large storage capacity.

To borrow an expression from the comments, it takes a long time to be used as energy.

Instead, it has a large amount of storage.

So, it is difficult to ignite, but once it catches fire, it is often compared to firewood that burns for a long time.

So, among the energy that our body needs,

The energy used by internal organs such as the heart, liver, lungs, small intestine, and large intestine, and

Like the energy used to maintain body temperature.

In places where a constant supply of energy is always needed, fat is used as energy.

If you suddenly need a lot of energy, like when running or lifting heavy objects,

Carbohydrates are primarily used for energy.

So, the fact that fat takes a long time to be used as energy is a characteristic, not a disadvantage.

The reason the human body can store fat in the first place is to utilize that characteristic.

4. Compared to omnivores, humans have less gastric juice and a longer intestine.

When comparing humans and omnivores.

Humans have low gastric juice.

It is true that the combined length of the small intestine and large intestine is longer compared to that of omnivores.

If you eat raw meat, it stays in your body for a long time.

It is true that meat can spoil and produce gases and toxic substances.

However, this is based solely on raw meat.

Meat that is cooked over fire is not a problem.

Raw meat is very firm, but when cooked over fire, it becomes very tender.

So, because it is easier to digest, it can be digested with less gastric juice.

Cooked meat spoils more slowly than raw meat, so even if the length of the intestines is long, it is not a problem.

For reference, when comparing humans and herbivores, the length of the human intestine is only half that of herbivores.

Compared to herbivores, the length of the human intestine is shorter.

It is also possible to argue that a vegetarian diet is not suitable for humans.

The interesting thing is that every time we compare the intestinal lengths of humans and omnivores,

There is hardly any discussion about the difference in intestinal length between herbivores and humans.

This is a bit unusual.

If the length of the intestine is long, meat can spoil, which becomes a problem.

Isn't it because plants don't have a problem with having a short intestine?

If it is acceptable for the length of the intestines to be short when consuming plant-based foods,

Herbivores do not need to have such long intestines.

But in reality, it has developed, hasn't it?

Because plant-based foods take a long time to digest and absorb.

It is necessary to hold onto that food in the body for a long time.

So, the length of the intestines is long in order to facilitate digestion and absorption for a long time.

Humans also cook plant-based foods before eating them.

Since digestion and absorption occur quickly, it's okay even if the length of the intestines is short.

So, humans are longer than animals that eat meat because of cooking.

It has developed a medium-length intestine that is shorter than that of herbivorous animals.

So, compared to animals that eat meat,

It is difficult to accept the claim that meat is not suitable for humans due to differences in physical structure.

Because if this is correct, humans have a different physical structure than herbivorous animals.

This means that a vegetarian diet is not suitable for humans.

But this doesn't make sense.

To summarize,

The lack of essential nutrients, including carbohydrates, in meat can be resolved by eating vegetables or fruits.

The issue of blood circulation problems arises from high levels of fat and cholesterol.

The problem arises from refined carbohydrates, not from meat consumption.

The reason it takes a long time for fat to be used as energy is that...

It's a characteristic of the region, not a disadvantage or problem.

Compared to omnivores, humans have less gastric acid and a longer intestinal length.

Just because humans are omnivores does not mean there is a justification for not eating meat.

Sounds plausible, right?

Looking at the content of the question, it seems similar to the content of a book by a vegetarian doctor.

I received a question about what I think about the content of a book, so I made a response video.

I will put a video link at the top right, so if you're curious, you can take a look.

I will come back with different content next time.
