I am addicted to junk food and snacks. I want to quit for my diet, but can I eat keto snacks instead?

To get straight to the point, the problem of sugar addiction can be resolved without keto snacks.

So, it's not necessary to eat keto snacks to solve your addiction to sweet foods.

To solve the problem of sweet food addiction, we need to understand the causes of the addiction symptoms.

I believe there are two main reasons.

If I have eaten enough and am full,

If you're feeling bored and want to eat something, there's a high probability of experiencing blood sugar fluctuations.

I had a sufficiently filling meal, and right now I'm not hungry.

If the time between meals is short, around 3 to 4 hours, it is likely a problem with energy conversion.

I explained the issues of blood sugar fluctuations and energy conversion in detail in a video I made earlier.

The video link is currently displayed in the upper right corner, so if you're curious about the details, you can click to watch it.

If you have seen the video I mentioned earlier,

You must have understood that the cause of blood sugar fluctuations and energy conversion issues is refined carbohydrates.

If I want to solve my problem with sugar addiction, I just need to reduce my intake of refined carbohydrates.

You don't necessarily have to eat keto snacks.

However, since the question mentioned "keto snacks," I wanted to share this just in case.

The low-carb, high-fat diet I talk about in various videos is not a ketogenic diet.

A low-carb, high-fat diet is a very broad concept of a diet, and

There are various types of diets included in it.

The ketogenic diet is one of them.

To briefly explain the difference,

The ketogenic diet significantly restricts the amount of carbohydrates.

A ketogenic diet is one that intentionally restricts carbohydrates to induce a state of ketosis in the body.

The low-carb, high-fat diet that I am talking about is

The problem is that the intake of carbohydrates is too high due to refined carbohydrates.

It is about reducing carbohydrate intake to an appropriate amount.

Because it is an appropriate amount, it naturally does not enter a state of ketosis.

Regarding the classification of a low-carb, high-fat diet,

Among the videos I created initially, there is one titled "Understanding the Low-Carb, High-Fat Diet."

This video explains in detail.

There is a video link in the upper right corner, so if you're not sure about the differences, it would be good to watch the video.

And in the case of the ketogenic diet,

You may want to snack because your carbohydrate intake is insufficient.

They say that a ketogenic diet keeps you full for a long time, so you don't feel hungry. Why do I still want to snack?

Carbohydrates are used in various places in our body.

The most commonly used sources are glucose in the brain and glycogen in the muscles.

If we intentionally eat a low amount of carbohydrates, problems will arise in these two areas.

When there is a shortage of glucose available for the brain, symptoms such as headaches and dizziness can occur.

When there is a lack of glucose available for muscle use, symptoms such as lethargy, fatigue, and body aches may occur.

In fact, the ketogenic diet does not claim that these symptoms do not exist.

I have symptoms, but I’ve been told that if I endure them, I will get used to them.

It's called "kitoflu" because it feels like a passing cold.

The reason these symptoms occur is that the body is lacking carbohydrates.

In that case, our bodies would want to consume carbohydrates.

The ketogenic diet is not a diet that involves eating very little food.

It's about reducing the intake of carbohydrates, but I'm eating a lot of other foods, so my stomach is full.

In that case, from the body's perspective, there is a feeling of fullness because the stomach is full, but there is a lack of carbohydrates.

So, there is a feeling of fullness, but you can still eat.

I find myself wanting snacks that are small in volume but high in carbohydrate content.

So, I started looking for snacks, and that's how keto snacks came about.

I will summarize.

The reason I find it hard to stop snacking and to give up sweet foods right now is...

It is because I am eating too many refined carbohydrates.

The problem can be resolved by reducing the intake of refined carbohydrates.

If you drastically reduce your carbohydrate intake,

Due to a lack of carbohydrates in the body, symptoms arise such as a desire to snack and cravings for sweet foods.

Therefore, replace refined carbohydrates with unrefined carbohydrates like fruits and vegetables.

I believe that consuming the amount your body needs is the best way to solve the problem.

Sounds plausible, right?
