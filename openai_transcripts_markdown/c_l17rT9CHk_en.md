The reason why people with severe obesity lose weight easily with just a little effort, while those with mild obesity do not, is...

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I started a diet with my friend.

My friend, who is severely obese, loses weight easily.

As someone with moderate obesity, I am struggling because I have a hard time losing weight.

I received a story like this, so I would like to talk about it.

First, let's read the content of the story.

I am a woman living on my own with a friend.

I started a diet together this time.

Since we work at the same place and live together, we eat the same things.

Since I do exercise while watching YouTube on TV, there is no difference.

However, my friend keeps losing weight, and I'm still the same.

My friend has already lost nearly 20kg.

I lost 2kg at first, and since then my weight has remained about the same.

If you feel like you've lost some weight, you'll return the next day.

If I feel like I've fallen again, I'll come back the next day. It's driving me crazy.

My friend was severely obese, weighing over 100 kg, and I am mildly obese.

At first, I thought my friend was losing weight easily because they were severely obese.

Even when I search the internet, it says that people with severe obesity tend to lose weight easily.

However, after studying dieting, I don't know why that is.

I thought my friend had a high basal metabolic rate, which is why they lose weight easily.

When I calculated it using a basal metabolic rate calculator,

My basal metabolic rate is 1400 kcal, while my friend's is 1800 kcal.

Since we are doing the same job at the same workplace, following the same diet and doing the same exercise.

If it's not the basal metabolic rate, there wouldn't be any difference in calories.

Can a difference like this occur just because the basal metabolic rate is 400 kcal higher?

I don't understand.

I saw on the internet that if body fat decreases and muscle increases, there may be no change in weight.

Honestly, I don't think we'll build a lot of muscle with the exercises we do at home.

Just to be sure, I got an InBody test done, but my friend had a much higher muscle mass.

I felt frustrated, so I tried reducing my diet by an additional 400 kcal.

Still, there hasn't been much change in my weight.

Why is my friend the only one losing weight even though we have the same diet and exercise routine?

If my friend is normal, then why am I not fitting in?

If I'm normal, then why does my friend keep disappearing?

I feel so frustrated that I think I'm going to go crazy.

Please help me.

This is the story with such content, so let's talk about it in detail.

Having a lot of body fat accumulated is called obesity.

The purpose of dieting is to reduce body fat.

Body fat can be broadly divided into two types.

It is the visceral fat attached to the organs and the subcutaneous fat located under the skin.

When men accumulate body fat, it primarily builds up as visceral fat.

Women primarily accumulate body fat as subcutaneous fat.

If a woman is like the person in the story and is mildly obese, it is mostly the case that she has a lot of subcutaneous fat.

On the other hand, if someone is severely obese like a friend, even if they are a woman, they tend to have a lot of both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat.

If you look at the process of becoming severely obese, you can understand why it happens.

As mentioned earlier,

In the case of women, when body fat accumulates, it primarily builds up as subcutaneous fat.

When subcutaneous fat accumulates, body weight increases accordingly.

Subcutaneous fat also has weight.

If subcutaneous fat continues to accumulate, the body will become heavier and heavier.

It requires more strength to support and move that body.

To exert greater strength, more muscle is needed.

Lifting heavy barbells and dumbbells increases muscle mass.

In the process of supporting and moving my heavy body, my muscle mass increases.

Due to this, individuals with severe obesity who weigh a lot have a high muscle mass even without exercising at all.

In fact, the friend of the person who shared the story had a high muscle mass according to the InBody test.

When muscle mass increases, the amount of energy the body uses also increases.

When the body uses more energy, visceral fat also increases.

Visceral fat is located right next to the organs, which makes it easy to utilize as energy.

It serves as a kind of energy storage.

Muscle mass has increased, and the energy the body consumes has also increased.

I am trying to increase the energy storage.

So the person in the story is mildly obese and has a lot of subcutaneous fat.

My friend is severely obese, so they have a lot of subcutaneous fat, a lot of visceral fat, and a lot of muscle mass as well.

In this state, I started my diet with the same meal plan and the same exercise.

I don't have information about what kind of diet you are following, but...

In the story, there is a lot of discussion about calories.

Considering that the person shared that they tried to reduce their diet by an additional 400 kcal,

It seems like you are following a low-calorie diet.

The problem is that a low-calorie diet is more effective at reducing visceral fat than subcutaneous fat.

As mentioned earlier,

Visceral fat is the fat that accumulates right next to the organs and serves as an energy storage.

If you put your body in an energy deficit with a low-calorie diet, it will draw the lacking energy from visceral fat.

In the process, visceral fat decreases.

When visceral fat decreases, body weight also tends to decrease.

Severe obesity is due to the increase in muscle mass to support the heavy weight.

When you lose weight, your muscles also decrease.

Even if you work hard to build muscle, it's like the muscles decrease when you stop exercising.

Because the weight was heavy, the muscles developed.

As you lose weight, you also lose muscle.

Since muscles have weight, if muscle mass decreases, body weight will also decrease.

So, the person's friend is losing weight quickly because both visceral fat and muscle mass are decreasing.

On the other hand, the person in question has little visceral fat and muscle, which is why there is little change in weight.

So, to summarize simply in three points:

Body fat is primarily divided into two types: visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

The second woman tends to accumulate body fat primarily in the subcutaneous layer.

In the case of mild obesity, there is a lot of subcutaneous fat.

Severe obesity involves an excess of subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, and muscle.

The third method of dieting that involves controlling calories is very effective in reducing visceral fat.

So it is effective for friends who have a lot of visceral fat, but...

It is not effective for individuals with low visceral fat and high subcutaneous fat.

It can be organized like this.

The reason the person sharing their story has difficulty losing weight while their friend loses weight easily is this.

Once my friend loses enough visceral fat and muscle, they will become similar to the person sharing their story.

So, what should someone like the person who shared their story do to lose weight?

Since visceral fat serves as an energy reserve, a low-calorie diet seems to be effective.

Subcutaneous fat also has its functions, and you can adjust your diet accordingly.

What does subcutaneous fat do? How can I reduce subcutaneous fat?

There was a similar question in the past, so I made a video answering it.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

What is the role of subcutaneous fat, and how can it be reduced?

When body fat accumulates

You mentioned that men tend to accumulate visceral fat while women tend to accumulate subcutaneous fat.

The body fat that accumulates mainly differs based on gender.

So I just learned that there are different methods for dieting.

Is there anything else a woman should be careful about when dieting, like this?

You need to be careful about weight changes according to your menstrual cycle.

It is often said that water has no calories, so drinking only water cannot lead to weight gain.

However, in the case of women, there are times when just drinking water can lead to weight gain depending on the menstrual cycle.

There was a question about the menstrual cycle before, so I made a detailed explanation video.

I will have related videos displayed in the top right, so if you're curious, you can click and watch them.

When I go on a diet, I tend to lose fat from my face, chest, and hips first.

When you gain weight, it tends to accumulate first in the arms, belly, and thighs, right? Why is that?

It's due to the relationship between muscle and subcutaneous fat.

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure to have related videos displayed in the bottom left.

You need to understand the relationship between muscle and subcutaneous fat because it makes the content easier to comprehend.

It is recommended to first watch the video in the top left, and then watch the video in the bottom left.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
