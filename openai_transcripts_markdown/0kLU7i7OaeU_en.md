A question about eating and going to sleep right away has been posted in the comments.

If you have a regular meal and then eat a late-night snack before going to bed,

Regardless of eating and going to bed right away, you will gain weight because you ate a late-night snack.

However, it wasn't that I had additional late-night snacks.

The total amount of food eaten that day is the same.

You asked if it's possible to gain weight just because you ate late and went to bed right after.

Let's talk in detail.

When you sleep, your digestive system should also rest.

If you go to sleep right after eating, your digestive system doesn't get a chance to rest.

They say that not digesting properly can lead to weight gain.

Yes, there is such a story.

In the past, I thought that while sleeping, the body rests and the basal metabolic rate decreases.

If the basal metabolic rate decreases, I thought that the function of the digestive system would also decrease.

However, recent studies have shown that the basal metabolic rate does not decrease significantly even during sleep.

There is an increasing number of claims that sleeping does not hinder digestion.

However, the truth is that which side's argument is correct is not important.

Because when you eat and go to sleep right away, the function of the digestive system decreases.

If that's causing you digestive issues, you should be losing weight, not gaining it.

The reason we become obese is that we eat a lot of food.

It is because so much food has been digested and absorbed, resulting in a lot of nutrients entering the body.

If the food is not properly digested even after eating, the nutrients from that food cannot be absorbed by the body.

If the nutrients from food are not absorbed by the body, then one should either not gain weight or even lose weight.

In fact, the dietary fiber in vegetables has the effect of hindering digestion.

Because of this effect, eating vegetables along with calorie-dense foods can help prevent weight gain.

So if there are no digestive issues, it's fine to eat and go to sleep right away.

It doesn't matter whether you eat and go to sleep right away or stay awake.

Eating and going straight to sleep won't lead to weight gain.

If it's true that digestion doesn't work well when you eat and go to sleep right away,

Since digestion is not good, I should either not gain weight or actually lose weight.

In this case, it can't be said that you gain weight just because you ate and went to sleep right away.

So, if I eat food and go to sleep right away, I won't gain weight?

No, that's not the case.

Eating and then going to sleep right away can lead to weight gain.

There are two main reasons. The first is due to post-meal activities.

When we eat food and are awake, we consume energy by moving our bodies.

If you eat food and then go to sleep, you won't be using energy since your body isn't moving.

This difference causes weight gain.

That's not what I'm curious about.

If I eat the same and move the same, can I gain weight if I eat and go to sleep right away?

You can gain weight.

So there is a person who consumes 300 energy in a day.

This person eats 100 for breakfast, 100 for lunch, and 100 for dinner, and then sleeps after some time.

If we compare the situation of eating 100 for a late breakfast, 100 for a late lunch, and 100 for a late dinner, and then going to bed right after,

Isn't it the same thing? But in reality, it is not.

When you moved is very important.

There is an interesting experiment about activities after meals.

After eating the same amount of food, I made sure to walk for 30 minutes afterward.

There is an experiment that claims to lose 3 kg in a month.

Walking for 30 minutes doesn't burn a significant amount of calories.

But why did such a difference occur?

It's because of blood sugar.

Recently, blood sugar has been considered important in dieting.

When you eat food, your blood sugar levels rise.

When blood sugar levels rise, insulin is released to lower the blood sugar.

This insulin is referred to as an obesity hormone because it has the effect of increasing body fat.

If you eat foods that significantly raise your blood sugar levels,

In order to lower that blood sugar, a lot of insulin needs to be released.

When insulin is produced in excess, it leads to an increase in body fat, resulting in obesity.

Eating foods that do not significantly raise blood sugar levels has become important in recent diets.

However, walking after a meal has the effect of suppressing the rise in blood sugar levels.

To move an object, energy is required.

A person naturally needs energy to walk.

When you walk after a meal, your body uses the glucose in your blood as energy.

When glucose in the blood is used for energy, blood sugar levels decrease.

When blood sugar levels decrease, the amount of insulin needed to lower blood sugar also decreases.

When the amount of insulin released decreases, the amount of body fat stored will also decrease.

If the amount of body fat stored decreases, then you will lose weight.

So even if you eat the same amount of food and engage in the same activities,

It means that differences arise depending on when that activity was done.

The reason you gain weight if you sleep right after eating is related to deep sleep.

When we eat food, it is to digest that food.

Gastric juice and digestive enzymes are released.

When you lie down to sleep,

As the position of the esophagus lowers, gastric acid and digestive enzymes can reflux into the esophagus.

The stomach is protected from gastric acid and digestive enzymes, but the esophagus is not.

So when gastric acid and digestive enzymes reflux, it causes inflammatory damage to the esophagus.

If this happens repeatedly, it will lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease.

If the esophagus is damaged while we eat and sleep, our body will wake up.

Even when I am sleeping, my body wakes up.

So if you eat and go to bed right away, you tend to feel quite fatigued the next morning.

As mentioned in the sleep diet series,

If you don't get enough sleep, it can lead to an increase in body fat.

That's why in dieting, getting good sleep is just as important as diet and exercise.

I will summarize.

Due to the reasons mentioned earlier, even if you consume the same number of calories, you can gain weight if you eat and then go to sleep right away.

So, it's better to avoid eating and then going to sleep right away, if possible.

You mentioned that not getting enough sleep can lead to an increase in body fat.

Please explain the principle of how body fat increases.

You said that walking for 30 minutes after a meal can help lose 3 kg in a month.

How exactly do you do it?
