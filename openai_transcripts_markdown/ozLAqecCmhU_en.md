How to distinguish between foods that help you lose weight and foods that make you gain weight.

Hello, this is pkang.

The topic of this video is about foods that help you lose weight and foods that make you gain weight.

In the past, low-calorie foods were referred to as foods that help with weight loss.

High-calorie foods were referred to as fattening foods.

However, a low-calorie diet composed of low-calorie foods can lower metabolism, making it easier to gain weight.

As it has become known that it is possible to lose weight with high-calorie diets like low-carb, high-fat diets,

There has been a statement that there is an error in distinguishing between foods that cause weight gain and those that lead to weight loss based solely on calories.

So, the concept of refined and unrefined foods emerged after that.

People who are unfamiliar with this concept may misunderstand it as just another term for low-calorie food.

Refined foods that cause weight gain and unrefined foods that promote weight loss.

I will discuss it in detail.

Recently, excessive secretion of insulin is considered a cause of obesity.

When you eat foods that rapidly raise your blood sugar, a large amount of insulin is released to lower the blood sugar.

Excessive insulin secretion increases body fat and causes one to eat more food.

When you eat foods that cause a lot of insulin to be released,

It means that as body fat accumulates and appetite increases, one ends up eating more and becoming obese.

On the contrary, if you eat foods that do not trigger a lot of insulin secretion,

You can naturally lose weight as body fat does not accumulate and your appetite decreases.

When blood sugar rises rapidly and significantly, it is said that a large amount of insulin is secreted.

Insulin only responds to blood sugar. The problem lies with carbohydrate foods that rapidly and significantly raise blood sugar levels.

There are cases where misunderstandings like this occur.

Insulin does not only respond to blood sugar levels.

It helps to use protein for muscle synthesis or to store fat as body fat.

In reality, it is a hormone that responds to carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

So, foods that quickly raise blood sugar levels significantly are also a problem.

In addition, the issue is that any food that delivers a large amount of nutrients to the body in a short period of time is problematic.

This serves as the criterion for distinguishing between refined and unrefined foods.

In the case of food that exists in nature,

The structure is such that a lot of nutrients cannot enter the body in a short amount of time.

For example, in the case of brown rice, it has a high carbohydrate content.

You can eat a lot of carbohydrates, but they are designed to be poorly digested and absorbed.

The contents of glutinous rice are protected by the husk, so after dissolving the husk, the contents can be digested.

Even if the shell is melted, the dietary fiber and phytic acid inside the shell hinder digestion and absorption.

So, the amount that is actually absorbed by the body is not much compared to the amount eaten.

So, you can eat a lot of carbohydrates, but...

That's a safety device called a shell that prevents the body from digesting and absorbing it.

On the contrary, there are foods that are digested and absorbed very quickly but cannot be eaten in large quantities.

A typical example is fruit.

The fructose contained in fruits is digested and absorbed very quickly.

Eating a lot of fruit can lead to obesity. There is such a saying.

However, fruits are composed of 80-90% water, which means they have a very low nutritional density.

In reality, the amount of carbohydrates in 100g of watermelon is only about 8g.

So, there is fructose, which is absorbed very quickly.

There is a safety barrier called water that prevents us from consuming too much of that fructose.

Foods that exist in nature, thanks to this safety mechanism, do not allow a large amount of nutrients to enter all at once.

Therefore, it does not cause obesity because there is no massive secretion of insulin.

This type of food is called unrefined food.

Food that has had its safety devices removed through processing is called refined food.

For example, the safety mechanism of brown rice is its husk, which hinders digestion and absorption.

When this skin is removed, it becomes white rice.

Because there is no outer layer that hinders digestion and absorption, the carbohydrates in white rice are quickly absorbed by the body.

In this case, blood sugar levels can rise quickly and significantly.

To lower blood sugar, a large amount of insulin is needed, and a large amount of insulin makes us obese.

So the carbohydrate content is similar and the calories are also similar.

Brown rice with the skin is a food that helps with weight loss, while white rice without the skin becomes a food that contributes to weight gain.

The safety feature of fruit is its moisture, and when this moisture is removed, it becomes dried fruit.

Since more than 80% of the total is made up of water, it will significantly decrease in volume when the water is gone.

In reality, when you dry 1 kg of bananas, it becomes 200 g of banana chips.

Eating 1kg of bananas in one sitting is difficult, but eating 200g of banana chips is not hard.

In 200g of banana chips, the carbohydrates that were present in 1kg of bananas are concentrated.

If you consume a large amount of fructose, which is quickly digested and absorbed in a short time, insulin will inevitably be secreted in large quantities.

So, fresh fruit is not fattening, but dried fruit can be fattening.

Can’t we simply think of products that come out processed from factories as all being refined foods?

Thinking that way can lead to errors.

For example, in the case of chicken breast products, although they are processed products,

It has simply been cooked and vacuum-packed for easy storage and convenience in eating chicken breast.

Make it possible to eat more chicken breast, which is not easy to eat a lot of.

It is not processed to make digestion and absorption faster.

It can be considered close to unprocessed food.

On the other hand, in the case of dried fruits or fruit juices made at home,

It's not a product made in a factory, and it doesn't contain any other additives either.

Fruits that couldn't be eaten in large quantities because they are quickly digested and absorbed.

It's processed to remove moisture or grind it so that it can be eaten in larger quantities, right?

So this is close to processed food.

Whether it was made in a factory or at home is not what matters.

Did it make you able to eat a lot of what you couldn't eat before?

Have you changed foods that are slow to digest and absorb into those that are quick to digest and absorb?

You should look at it from this perspective.

I don't know how to make digestion and absorption faster so that I can eat more.

I know how to make digestion and absorption faster and how to change it so that I can eat more.

You are just not used to connecting the information you already know.

For example, you may have heard that you should chew your food thoroughly before swallowing.

Why should we do that?

Chewing food well is important for proper digestion and absorption, as it reduces the burden on the digestive system.

Because of this, I have no teeth and cannot chew well, and the baby food that a child with weak digestion eats is...

We chop or grind the ingredients to make it.

So, food that is either ground, chopped, or crushed is easier to digest and absorb.

So, what happens if we grind white rice, which is a food that makes you gain weight just by eating it, into a powder?

Naturally, as digestion and absorption speed up, it becomes food that makes you gain more weight.

Food made from ground white rice flour is called rice cake.

Food made from flour, which is made by grinding wheat, includes noodles and bread.

So while white rice is a fattening food, rice cakes, noodles, and bread are even more fattening.

In the same concept, it's just that meat is fine, but...

Processed meat that is ground or minced and then reformed becomes fattening food.

I understand which foods are easy to digest and absorb, but what about foods that can be eaten in larger quantities?

When it is made into a liquid, it allows for a larger quantity to be consumed.

For example, I want to eat a lot of vegetables because it's said that eating a lot of vegetables is good for health.

It's hard to eat a lot of raw vegetables, so it's common to see them blended into juice.

People who exercise to build muscle want to consume a lot of protein after their workouts.

It's hard to eat a lot of chicken breast, so I often grind it up and make it into a shake to drink.

This appearance was also shown on the broadcast.

So, if you grind difficult-to-eat foods into a liquid, it becomes easier to consume a lot of them.

I will summarize.

It was originally a food that couldn't be eaten in large quantities, but now it can be eaten in larger amounts.

It was food that was difficult or slow to digest and absorb, but now it is easy and quick to digest and absorb.

Food that has been processed in this way is called refined food.

Such refined foods cause a large amount of insulin to be released.

It makes you eat more and increases body fat, leading to obesity.

Processed foods are foods that make you gain weight.

If you reduce the intake of refined foods and start eating unrefined foods,

Because there is no large amount of insulin secretion.

The appetite that used to make me want to eat a lot decreases, and as body fat decreases, I lose weight.

This unrefined food is food that helps you lose weight.

This is the core theory in dieting.

All diet methods are created by adding different conditions on top of this theory.

Often, high-carb low-fat diets and low-carb high-fat diets make opposing claims.

Why do both diets have a weight loss effect? This question often comes up in the comments.

By prohibiting the intake of refined foods and allowing fats, it becomes a low-carb, high-fat diet.

If you prohibit the intake of refined foods and also ban fats, it becomes a high-carb, low-fat diet.

In reality, a high-carb, low-fat diet suggests eating meals primarily based on carbohydrates, but...

The consumption of snacks, white rice, bread, and noodles is prohibited.

The low-carb, high-fat diet suggests eating a meat-based diet, but

The consumption of processed meats is prohibited.

So both diets prohibit the consumption of refined foods.

You can say that the diet is effective because the consumption of processed foods is prohibited.

In addition to these two diets, there are diet plans that you know and will come to know in the future.

You can always think of it as including this theory.

In other words, the emergence of various diets is

It's because other conditions are added on top of this theory.

If you want to completely remove all those conditions and just focus purely on dieting,

If you simply reduce your intake of refined foods and increase your intake of unrefined foods,

It means that weight can be lost.

Because that's the most essential part.
