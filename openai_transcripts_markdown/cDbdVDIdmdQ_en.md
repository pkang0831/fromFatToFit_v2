The reason why the effects of probiotics vary from person to person.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the fourth video about gut microbiota.

In the first video, it was discussed that one can become obese even with a small amount of food, depending on the composition of gut microbiota.

In the second video, we talked about the patented diet probiotic BNR 17.

In the third video, we talked about whether there are actually fat bacteria, or obesity bacteria.

In this video, I would like to talk about probiotics.

Since the content continues from the last video, it is better to watch them in order.

The playlist link is available in the description of the video and at the top right.

If you want to watch the videos in order from the last one, you can click and view them.

In the last video, it was mentioned that the number of gut microorganisms is in the tens of trillions and that there are hundreds of different types.

Because all those hundreds of microorganisms do different jobs and influence each other.

It was mentioned that introducing a specific strain in large quantities does not have a significant effect.

However, looking at the probiotic products that have been released recently,

There are many products that combine various types of probiotics so that they can be taken all at once.

And this probiotic is coated so that it can survive and reach the intestines.

Once you arrive at the destination, you are supposed to eat food together to avoid starving to death.

The probiotics I take are probiotics.

The food for probiotics is called prebiotics.

If various types of probiotics can reach the intestines well and utilize food to settle and reproduce,

From then on, probiotics will continue to be in my gut.

Each probiotic product contains different types of probiotics.

The probiotics I am currently taking will settle in my gut.

By consuming products that contain different strains of probiotics, the method allows for another type of probiotic to establish itself.

If various types of probiotics settle in my gut,

Isn't it helpful for health and dieting?

There are times when I think like this.

In fact, probiotics need to settle in the gut.

It is better to periodically change probiotic products rather than continuously consuming just one.

There are people who talk like this.

However, that's not actually the case.

Probiotics have beneficial effects on our bodies, and it is true that they are a type of beneficial bacteria.

It is not a bacterium that settles and lives in the intestines.

When you eat fermented foods or consume probiotic products, they briefly enter your body.

It's a fungus that disappears over time.

The lifespan of probiotics is approximately 2 weeks.

So the probiotics I took stay in the gut for about two weeks before disappearing.

Due to the characteristic of staying briefly and then leaving, probiotics have the nickname "travelers."

So, it doesn't make sense to eat probiotics to settle them in the gut and have them multiply.

In fact, this is something you can understand with just a little thought.

If the probiotics we consumed settle in the intestines, reproduce, and remain there continuously,

When you continuously consume probiotic products, it should actually lead to health problems.

Typically, probiotic products recommend consuming about 10 billion units per day.

Out of these 10 billion, only a few will survive to reach adulthood.

Among the probiotics that arrive in the intestines, only a portion will settle there.

Even if the number is not large, if the probiotics do not disappear and continue to stay in the intestines,

If you continue to consume 10 billion probiotics every day, the number of those probiotics will inevitably continue to increase.

The space in the intestines is limited.

If a specific type of probiotic continues to multiply and takes up a lot of space,

Because of that probiotic, there is no longer room for other beneficial bacteria.

Ultimately, the gut microbiome ecosystem becomes disrupted.

The fact that consuming high-concentration probiotics for several months or even years poses no problems at all is itself...

The probiotics I took cannot stay in the gut and keep disappearing.

So, does that mean taking probiotics is pointless?

No, that's not the case.

It means that probiotics do not settle in the gut.

It doesn't mean that it isn't helpful for gut health.

Taking probiotics can be beneficial for gut health.

However, I haven't really seen much effect from taking probiotics.

It varies depending on the condition of my gut health.

To make it easier to understand, for example,

The intestines are a home where beneficial bacteria and harmful bacteria coexist.

Beneficial bacteria are those that frequently clean the house and keep it clean.

Harmful bacteria are the type of bacteria that make a home messy and dirty.

You can think of probiotics as a housekeeper that helps with cleaning your home.

People who have issues with their eating habits tend to have a high number of harmful bacteria.

Probiotics that help clean the house can be beneficial.

If harmful bacteria keep making a mess as much as probiotics are diligently cleaning, it would be meaningless.

So, if you only take probiotics without improving your eating habits, you won't feel much of an effect.

To experience the effects of probiotics,

You need to improve your eating habits to reduce harmful bacteria and increase beneficial bacteria.

However, if you improve your eating habits, harmful bacteria will decrease.

It won't get dirty at home.

If the house doesn't get dirty, then probiotics become unnecessary.

So, there are people who experienced effects when they first took probiotics.

As time passes and gut health improves, it becomes difficult to feel the effects of probiotics.

So, in a situation where there are many harmful bacteria and few beneficial bacteria, the gut health is not good.

The harmful bacteria decrease and the beneficial bacteria increase, leading to an improvement in gut health.

Probiotics are effective only during this period, and you can feel their effects.

The person in question says that taking probiotics has been effective for them.

People who do not fall into this category are said to not experience any effects from taking probiotics.

So to summarize...

Probiotics are not bacteria that settle in the intestines and live continuously.

I am a guest who stays for a while and then leaves.

So, compared to the bacteria that settle in my intestines and continue to live there, the impact on my body is bound to be less.

If there are many harmful bacteria, then gut health is not good.

The probiotics are unable to overcome the harmful bacteria, so I am not feeling any effects.

If there are many beneficial bacteria and your gut health is good, you may not need probiotics and therefore may not feel their effects.

Probiotics are what I turn to when I try to improve my gut health by changing my eating habits.

You can think of it as helping with that process.

I will be back in the next video. Thank you.

In the first part of the video on gut microbiota

Mice that received gut microbiota transplants from obese individuals gain weight even when eating the same amount.

You mentioned that mice that received gut microbiota transplants from slim individuals lost weight even when eating the same amount.

Germ-free mice were fed human feces for transplantation.

I saw a funny comment saying that after watching that video, should I eat the poop of a slim person?

Is there a method for transplanting gut microorganisms from one person to another, other than consuming feces?

Yes, there is.

It's called fecal transplantation.

In the next video, let's talk about fecal transplantation.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears in the top right corner.

If the video is not completed, another video is scheduled to be released.

If the video in the upper right is not part 5 of the gut microbiome,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

You keep telling me to improve my eating habits.

Aren't you going to tell me how to actually improve?

You should reduce refined foods and eat unrefined foods.

I previously made a detailed video explaining about refined and unrefined foods.

I will make a video that explains unrefined foods in detail, which will be displayed in the top left.

You can choose and watch the video you are curious about.
