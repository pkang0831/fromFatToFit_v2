The reason why the effects of bulletproof coffee vary from person to person - Bulletproof Coffee Part 2

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video about bulletproof coffee.

In Part 1 of the video, under the same conditions with everything else being equal,

We talked about the claim that just drinking bulletproof coffee can lead to weight loss.

If you are curious about the content of Part 1 of the video,

The link to Part 1 of the video is displayed in the upper right, so you can click on it to watch.

In this video, when I drank bulletproof coffee...

Let's explore the reasons why some people experience the effects of dieting while others do not.

In the first part of the video, it is mentioned that bulletproof coffee itself does not have weight loss effects.

If only bulletproof coffee is added while other conditions remain unchanged,

You mentioned that there was no effect from the diet.

To put it the other way around,

This means that if there are changes in other conditions, it is possible to see a dieting effect.

The easiest way to see results is by changing the amount of food you eat.

Drinking bulletproof coffee can create a feeling of fullness or reduce appetite.

If I use this to reduce the amount of food I was originally eating,

Because the amount of food intake has decreased, there may be a weight loss effect.

So the effect of dieting comes from reducing the amount of food you eat.

Bulletproof coffee is said to help reduce meal portions.

Among those who practice intermittent fasting by having fasting periods during which they do not actually eat, leading to a reduction in meal portions.

A lot of people drink bulletproof coffee.

This is because bulletproof coffee helps in maintaining the fasting hours of intermittent fasting.

There are people who have lost weight without reducing their food intake, right?

If other conditions besides meal quantity change, it can lead to a weight loss effect.

In Part 1 of the video, it was mentioned that drinking bulletproof coffee does indeed increase the amount of speech.

As the metabolic rate increases like this, if the level of activity or exercise also increases,

An increase in activity and exercise can lead to weight loss effects.

People who say that drinking bulletproof coffee has no effect fall into the opposite category.

This is a case where only bulletproof coffee is consumed without any changes in meal quantity, activity level, or exercise amount.

It would be great if there were magical foods or pills that could make you lose weight just by eating them.

There are still no such medicines or foods available.

I have a small appetite, but the bulletproof coffee didn't seem to have any effect on me.

The difference in meal quantity before and after drinking bulletproof coffee is important.

For example, after reducing your calorie intake and losing some weight,

There are quite a few people who drink bulletproof coffee because they want to lose more weight.

In this case, there are often not many changes even if you drink bulletproof coffee.

Due to the weight loss effect from reducing meal portions, my weight has already decreased.

Because after that, I drink bulletproof coffee.

Compared to before the diet, the amount of food consumed has decreased.

There hasn't been any change in my meal quantity compared to before I started drinking bulletproof coffee.

You are maintaining the reduced amount of food intake as it is.

So in such cases, it is often the case that there are no additional weight loss effects.

Of course, if you reduce your meal portions even more, there are cases where you can lose more weight.

If you drastically reduce your food intake, issues with a low-calorie diet may arise.

A lack of other nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, can lead to additional problems.

I will summarize.

The weight loss effect of bulletproof coffee is not due to the coffee itself.

This is the effect that occurs when you reduce your meal portions by utilizing the satiety of bulletproof coffee.

I usually eat a lot, so I want to reduce my meal portions.

For those who struggle with a strong appetite, bulletproof coffee can be helpful.

However, for someone who doesn't usually eat a lot of food or

For someone who is already on a diet and has reduced their food intake, bulletproof coffee may not be very effective.

There is a limit to how much I can reduce my meal portions.

Hearing that people lost weight by drinking bulletproof coffee, rather than just drinking it without thought,

It is advisable to think about whether it can be helpful in your situation and make a choice.

It seems that the feeling of fullness and reduced appetite that comes from drinking bulletproof coffee is important.

Why is the effect gradually diminishing?

When I first drank bulletproof coffee, I felt full for a long time and my appetite was suppressed.

As I kept drinking, I quickly became hungry again and my appetite returned.

In the next video, we will discuss the satiety and appetite-reducing effects of bulletproof coffee.

I will talk about the reasons why drinking bulletproof coffee for a long time may lead to a decrease in its effects.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the third part of the bulletproof coffee video, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.
