This is the fourth video about whether ramen is a fattening food.

In the first video, we talked about the nutritional ratio of ramen.

In the second video, we talked about the calories in ramen.

In the third video, we talked about ramen and exercise.

In this video, we will discuss how there are people who can eat a lot of ramen without gaining weight.

I would like to talk about the claim that ramen is not a fattening food.

If ramen is a fattening food,

What is the secret of the grandfather who has lived for over 48 years eating only ramen but hasn't gained weight?

What about someone who can eat 20 bowls of ramen at once and not gain weight?

A comment with this content has been posted.

The grandfather, who has lived for over 48 years eating only ramen, does not gain weight.

This is the story of 43-year-old Park Byeong-gu, who suffered from intestinal stenosis.

Due to intestinal stenosis, the passage of the intestines has narrowed, and I have been vomiting everything I eat.

After eating ramen, they said they felt a refreshing sensation as if their stomach was cleared out, along with a sense of fullness.

Since then, I have been living on nothing but ramen.

I have been living like that for over 48 years, and I haven't gained weight or had any health issues.

However, in the case of Grandpa Park Byeong-gu, it is a unique situation with intestinal stenosis.

You cannot compare a person with stenosis to someone without it in the same position.

Grandfather Park Byeong-gu, who has stenosis, said that he doesn't gain weight even when he eats ramen.

It can't be said that this would be the case for people without stenosis.

A person who can eat 20 bowls of ramen at once but doesn't gain weight.

This person is a YouTuber named Jjuyang who does mukbang on YouTube.

However, Jjuyang doesn't gain weight even when eating a lot of other foods, not just ramen.

For example, we collaborated with a snack company and filmed a video of us eating snacks.

Four chicken leg snacks.

Two potato chips.

Three Churros Snacks

Two large bags of banana kicks.

I eat two shrimp chips.

I eat all of this in one sitting.

If we convert it to calories,

A container of chicken leg snacks is 319 kcal. Since I ate 4 of them, that amounts to 1,276 kcal.

A bag of potato chips is 345 kcal. Since I ate 2 bags, that makes 690 kcal.

One bag of Chulbyeong snack is 430 kcal. Since I ate three bags, that totals 1,290 kcal.

A large bag of banana kicks contains 560 kcal. Since I ate 2 bags, that totals 1,120 kcal.

A bag of shrimp chips is 465 kcal. Since I ate 2 bags, that makes it 930 kcal.

When you add all of this together, it amounts to 5,306 kcal.

Even considering that there may be some errors, that's an incredibly high number of calories.

Let's think about it for a moment.

Jjuyang can eat 20 bowls of ramen and not gain weight.

Therefore, I cannot agree with your statement that eating ramen makes you gain weight.

It is said that.

Jjuyang can eat 5,000 kcal worth of snacks without gaining weight.

So it becomes a story that eating snacks doesn't lead to weight gain.

In addition to this, Jjuyang eats a wide variety of foods.

In the video of eating a hamburger, they sometimes drink 10 cups of soda.

In videos of people eating barbecue, they sometimes consume over 20,000 kcal.

It's not about eating a lot of calories for a moment and then stopping.

I have been consistently eating a lot of calories.

Jjuyang continues to eat a lot of calories, but she doesn't gain weight.

We will do the same.

Therefore, we also do not gain weight even if we consume a lot of calories.

You can't make such a claim.

It's only natural to gain weight if you eat like that.

It's a unique case that Jjuyang doesn't gain weight.

In the second part of the ramen video

One serving of ramen is 500 kcal, but the reason it is considered a fattening food is...

It was said that ramen itself increases appetite, making you eat more food.

If you eat exactly 3 servings of ramen a day, you might not gain weight.

The ramen itself increases appetite, so it cannot be done that way.

But if eating ramen increases your appetite, can't you just endure it?

There are people who talk like this.

Someone who can do that probably never gained weight in the first place.

The reason we become obese is

Unlike Jjuyang, eating a lot can lead to weight gain.

The reason we eat a lot is

It's because I can't resist the increased appetite that comes from foods like ramen.

A person who grew up in a financially difficult environment

What should I do to make a lot of money? When you are pondering this question.

You just need to be born into a wealthy family and receive a large inheritance.

You shouldn't say, "Just buy a lottery ticket and if you win, that's it."

In the same concept.

To someone who couldn't resist the increased appetite from ramen, ended up overeating, and became obese.

You can say that even if your appetite increases after eating ramen, you can just hold back.

For someone who is contemplating how to plan their diet for weight loss.

Jjuyang eats 20 ramen noodles, 5,000 kcal of snacks, and 20,000 kcal of barbecue, yet still looks slim.

This means that one should not speak like this.

That's not an answer to what I asked.

I will summarize.

The average annual salary of a graduate from the University of North Carolina's Department of Geography in 1985 is said to be $100,000 (1 billion won).

The reason the average salary of geography graduates is so high is that

This is because Michael Jordan is among those graduates.

Michael Jordan, who graduated with a degree in geography, is earning an incredibly high salary.

Everyone who graduates with a degree in geography will receive a high salary.

We can't talk like this, can we?

Because Michael Jordan is a special case.

There are indeed people, like Grandpa Park Byeong-gu or Jjuyang, who can eat ramen without gaining weight.

Just because we eat ramen doesn't mean it serves as evidence that we won't gain weight.

Because Grandpa Park Byeong-gu and Jjuyang are a special case.

If you eat a lot and become obese, leading to the need for a diet,

Unlike Jjuyang, you have a body type that gains weight easily when you eat a lot.

To diet, you should not eat a lot and

If you want to eat less but find it hard to resist because your appetite is high,

When you eat refined foods, your appetite increases.

Because I am someone who cannot resist that increased appetite.

It means that we should reduce the intake of refined foods like ramen.

Why do mukbang YouTubers like Jjuyang not gain weight even though they eat a lot?

I previously made a video answering the same question.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

You said to reduce the intake of processed foods to decrease appetite.

What is refined food, and why does reducing refined food decrease appetite?

I previously made a detailed video explaining refined and unrefined foods.

Who doesn't know that eating foods that don't make you gain weight leads to dieting?

However, I don't want to eat food that doesn't taste good.

Many people think that foods that are helpful for dieting are not tasty.

So, refined foods make you gain weight, so if you reduce refined foods and eat unrefined foods,

Ah~ Unrefined foods are helpful for dieting and

Then that food must not taste good.

I think like this.

But that's not the case.

A comment like "I would rather starve and lose weight than eat bad food" was posted.

I made a video about not having to eat food that doesn't taste good.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom left.

Foods that are good for dieting don't taste good.

Unrefined food is likely to taste bad.

When talking about dieting, we often discuss body types a lot, right?

If I stick to a consistent diet, can I become someone who doesn't gain weight?

That question came up before, so I made a related video.

I will make sure to have a video about having a body type that doesn't gain weight appear in the bottom right.
