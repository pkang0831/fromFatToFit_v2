If you make weight-loss foods like this, you'll gain weight.

Hello, this is pkang.

I recently posted a video about how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight.

According to the content in that video, sweet potatoes are considered a food that helps with weight loss.

There is a video saying that sweet potatoes are fattening foods, so you shouldn't eat them. What do you think about that?

I received this kind of question, so in this video, I would like to talk about that question.

First, to summarize the content of the video titled "Sweet Potatoes are Fatty Foods,"

Rice is known to be fattening food, while sweet potatoes are considered weight-loss food. However,

In fact, the carbohydrate content of sweet potatoes is almost the same as that of rice.

Therefore, sweet potatoes are also a food that can make you gain weight, just like rice.

The creator of the video talks about how they gained weight after eating sweet potatoes.

The video also features a scene comparing the nutritional components of rice and steamed sweet potatoes.

On the left is rice, and on the right is steamed sweet potato. In terms of carbohydrate content, there isn't much difference between them.

So, is sweet potato a fattening food? Not really.

In the video about distinguishing between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight, I already mentioned this.

The distinction between foods that make you gain weight and those that help you lose weight is not based on their nutritional components.

Have you processed food that couldn't be eaten in large quantities so that it can be eaten in larger amounts?

Has the food that is slow to digest and absorb been processed to speed up digestion and absorption?

It will be determined based on whether it is processed or not.

For example, white rice and brown rice have almost no difference in carbohydrate content.

If foods can be categorized as fattening or slimming based on their nutritional content,

White rice and brown rice, which have similar nutritional components, are both foods that can lead to weight gain.

Both should be foods that help with weight loss.

In reality, brown rice is a food that helps with weight loss, while white rice is a food that contributes to weight gain.

The reason for this difference is due to variations in digestion and absorption.

Brown rice contains elements that hinder digestion and absorption, such as the husk, dietary fiber, and phytic acid.

So when consumed, digestion and absorption are slow, and the amount absorbed by the body is not very high.

However, white rice has had its husk, dietary fiber, and phytic acid removed through processing.

When consumed, it is quickly digested and absorbed, leading to a large amount being absorbed by the body, which results in obesity.

Sweet potatoes are one of the foods that are digested and absorbed slowly, like brown rice.

That's why sweet potatoes are referred to as a diet food.

In fact, there are a lot of people who have lost weight by using sweet potatoes.

So, simply because the carbohydrate content is the same,

You can't say that sweet potatoes and rice are equally fattening foods.

So why did the creator of that video gain weight from eating sweet potatoes?

It's because of the way to eat sweet potatoes.

In the video about distinguishing between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight,

I mainly dealt with the appearance of food that is either cut, minced, or ground.

In addition to that, there are things that can speed up digestion and absorption.

It means cooking food over fire.

When food is cooked, it changes into a form that is easier to digest and absorb.

Vegetables are better digested and absorbed when cooked rather than eaten raw.

Such stories are commonly heard.

Raw meat is firm, but when cooked, it becomes very tender.

So, the longer you cook food and the higher the temperature, the more it changes into a form that is digested and absorbed quickly.

In short, it becomes food that gradually makes you gain weight.

In fact, the method of cooking sweet potatoes can completely change their GI index.

What is the GI index?

You can think of it as a comparison of how quickly blood sugar levels rise after eating food.

The higher the GI index, the faster the food raises blood sugar levels.

When processing food to make digestion and absorption faster, the GI index increases.

In reality, the GI index of brown rice, which is digested and absorbed slowly, is 55.

The GI index of white rice, which is processed by removing the husk of brown rice, is 85.

Is a GI index of 85 considered high?

If the GI index is lower than 55, it refers to foods that raise blood sugar slowly.

Foods that quickly raise blood sugar if they are above 70 are categorized this way.

A GI index of 85 can be considered high.

Then what is the GI index of sweet potatoes?

The GI index of steamed sweet potatoes is around 50 to 60.

The GI index of roasted sweet potatoes is over 80.

So, eating steamed sweet potatoes is a food that helps you lose weight, just like brown rice.

When you eat roasted sweet potatoes, they become a food that can make you gain weight, just like white rice.

What do you think the creator of the video "Sweet Potatoes are Fattening Foods" ate sweet potatoes?

I heard that they cooked it in the air fryer.

So the problem isn't the sweet potato itself, but rather that it was cooked in the air fryer.

Aren't both steamed sweet potatoes and roasted sweet potatoes just sweet potatoes? It seems a bit odd to differentiate them based on the cooking method...

In that case, both brown rice and white rice are just rice, and chicken breast and fried chicken are all just chicken anyway.

The distinction between foods that make you gain weight and those that help you lose weight is not based on nutritional content or the type of food.

Has the food that is slow to digest and absorb been processed to digest and absorb quickly?

Has the food that couldn't be eaten in large quantities been processed so that it can be eaten in larger amounts?

It will be determined based on whether it is processed or not.

If you think of cooking food as part of processing that speeds up digestion and absorption, it will be easier to understand.

So, is eating it raw without cooking the best option for dieting?

Of course, that's not the case.

I mentioned it in another video as well.

When we say that certain behaviors lead to obesity,

Doing the exact opposite of that behavior is not necessarily the most effective way to diet.

They say that eating too much food can lead to obesity.

Not eating at all and starving is not the best way to diet, right?

Similarly, frying food in oil or

If cooking at high temperatures using an oven or air fryer interferes with dieting, then...

You just need to cook it to a normal level without using very high temperatures.

In fact, sweet potatoes and brown rice are foods that can help you lose weight even if you don't eat them raw.

For reference, cooking food over fire makes it easier to digest and absorb, which can lead to weight gain.

There is a saying that eating food raw without cooking it can help with dieting.

The raw food diet was briefly popular.

However, many people stopped eating it raw without cooking because they ended up with an upset stomach.

Most foods that can be eaten without cooking are low-calorie foods like fruits and vegetables.

Many people experienced yo-yo dieting due to low-calorie diets.

Again, when it was said that certain behaviors lead to obesity,

The behavior that is the complete opposite is not necessarily the most effective dieting method.

You just need to avoid behaviors that lead to obesity.

I will summarize.

The longer food is cooked and the higher the temperature it is cooked at, the easier it becomes to digest and absorb.

If food is cooked at too high a temperature or for too long, it gradually becomes more fattening.

That doesn't mean you have to eat food raw or not cook it.

Just cooking it to a normal level is enough.

If sweet potatoes have a high GI index and are foods that are digested and absorbed quickly, what about potatoes?

The GI index of potatoes is as high as that of white rice...

However, according to your classification, Ron, shouldn't potatoes also not be considered fattening food?

In the next video, we will learn about foods with a high GI index, such as potatoes.

There should be two videos on the screen right now. I will make sure the next video appears on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not a newly released video, please wait a few days as it is still being made.
