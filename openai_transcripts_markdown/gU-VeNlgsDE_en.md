The reason for binge eating in the evening after starving to lose weight - Eating Disorders Part 1

There have been quite a few comments asking for information about anorexia and bulimia.

In this video, I would like to talk about anorexia and bulimia.

Anorexia and bulimia are collectively referred to as eating disorders.

If you have a severe eating disorder, it is advisable to visit a hospital for help.

When eating disorders worsen, they can develop into symptoms of vomiting after eating.

The human body learns through repetition of any action.

If you repeatedly engage in the behavior of eating and vomiting, your body learns and becomes increasingly accustomed to it.

Once you get used to it, it becomes difficult to break free from the symptoms.

If your symptoms are severe, please make sure to visit a hospital.

First, the causes of binge eating can be broadly categorized into three main types.

The first is binge eating caused by processed foods.

The second is binge eating due to insufficient meal portions.

The third is binge eating due to mental issues.

First of all, binge eating caused by processed foods has been a topic discussed in many other videos.

Foods that are high in nutrient content and are quickly digested and absorbed are referred to as refined foods.

Such refined foods have the characteristic of allowing a large amount of nutrients to be absorbed by the body in a short period of time.

The body quickly secretes a large amount of insulin to process this nutrient.

Because it is secreted in large amounts urgently, an excessive amount of insulin is released.

Excessively secreted insulin increases body fat and triggers hunger.

This leads to eating a lot of food frequently, which increases body fat and results in obesity.

Recently, the cause of obesity is being attributed to processed foods.

Most diets focus on reducing the intake of refined foods and emphasize eating unrefined foods.

What exactly are refined and unrefined foods? How do you distinguish between them?

It can be classified based on whether the food is processed or not.

In the video I made before about [how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods], I explained it in detail.

The video link is available in the top right corner.

Just by reducing the intake of refined foods, you can prevent binge eating caused by them.

Binge eating due to insufficient second meal portion.

Among those who are dieting, there are quite a few people who say that it is difficult to lose weight because they binge eat every evening.

However, when we look at the diets of these people,

I didn't have time to eat breakfast.

For lunch, I ate low-calorie food for my diet.

There is a pattern of eating a lot of food in the evening after coming home.

In the evening, I eat much more compared to breakfast and lunch, so people say it's binge eating.

It's actually a natural phenomenon.

In order for a person to live, food is necessary.

So if you don't eat, the desire to eat arises.

When you eat enough food, you start to feel like you want to stop eating.

Since I hardly ate breakfast and lunch, my desire for food is gradually increasing due to a lack of meals.

The desire that has grown this much explodes in the evening, leading to eating a lot of food.

If you don't eat, the desire to eat will arise.

You said that if you eat enough food, you won't want to eat anymore.

In intermittent fasting, it is said that fasting without eating can actually reduce appetite, right?

If you want to stop eating when you've had enough food, then why is obesity a problem in the first place?

If you don't consider binge eating caused by processed foods, you might think that way.

In the beginning of the video, it mentions that consuming refined foods that are high in nutrient content and are quickly digested and absorbed...

A large amount of nutrients enters the body.

To process this nutrient, insulin is secreted in excess.

It was said that this much insulin increases body fat and makes you eat more food more often.

Because of this, I have eaten enough food, but I still have the urge to eat more.

So, it leads to obesity.

Intermittent fasting is a method of eating that involves having fasting periods, which reduces the intake of processed foods.

Eating processed foods increases appetite.

During the fasting period, by not eating refined foods, it helps to lower the increased appetite back to normal.

So to summarize,

Eating processed foods increases appetite, leading to overeating and obesity.

To diet, you just need to change the types of food you eat to non-processed options.

However, most people tend to diet when

I am trying to change the types of food I eat to healthier options while also reducing the quantity I consume.

So, while binge eating caused by refined foods has disappeared, binge eating due to insufficient meal portions has emerged.

Among those who actually practice intermittent fasting,

After having a fasting period, some people find that their appetite decreases, so there are those who say that a 16-hour fast is not difficult.

Some people find it difficult to stick to a 16-hour fast and say they can't do intermittent fasting.

The reason for this difference is due to the types of food being consumed.

People who eat enough unprocessed foods have their appetite under control.

Maintaining a 16-hour fasting period is not that difficult.

People who eat refined foods or those who eat unrefined foods but reduce their portion sizes.

It's difficult to maintain a 16-hour fast due to binge eating caused by insufficient meal portions.

The solution to overeating caused by insufficient meal portions is simple.

Just make sure to provide a sufficient meal.

The food that should be eaten at this time is, of course, unrefined food.

Ah... but... I feel like it will make me gain weight if I eat it.

Most people think that way.

In fact, it is a well-known fact that starving is not good for you.

However, due to the fear that eating food will make me gain weight, I try not to eat well.

This causes anorexia.

The fundamental cause of binge eating due to insufficient food intake is actually the refusal of food, which is anorexia.

In the next video, I will talk about anorexia.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to display the next video on the right once it is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the eating disorder video,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
