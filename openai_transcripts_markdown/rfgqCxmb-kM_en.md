How much should I eat to diet without gaining weight back?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I received a story from someone who doesn't know what it feels like to eat just enough to be comfortably full, so I want to talk about it.

First, let's read the content of the story.

Hello, pkang. I am a woman in my twenties.

I was addicted to刺激 foods like cake, mala soup, and tteokbokki, and I was obese.

I am trying to diet by following an extreme diet plan.

I have been alternating between fasting and binge eating for several years, and I have developed depression and social anxiety.

But in the end, my weight stayed the same.

Then I came across a video by pkang on YouTube and started eating mainly unrefined foods.

It's really amazing how my appetite has been controlled.

Sometimes I wanted to eat something spicy.

In that case, I just ate moderately.

I was also amazed that I could eat moderately and stop.

Since I eat well and feel full, I have the energy to exercise and stretch.

I am feeling very mentally at ease, and my weight is gradually going down.

It's amazing that my weight, which wouldn't go down even when I was starving, is now decreasing while I'm eating well.

However, I've recently been having concerns about the amount I'm eating.

The diets I have followed so far had a set number of calories that I was supposed to consume each day.

However, there are no such rules in pkang's diet.

They say you can eat unprocessed foods in moderation to feel adequately full.

I don't know how much I should eat to feel full.

While eating food in a hungry state,

When hunger disappears, do I have to stop eating even if I'm not full?

Or do I have to eat until my stomach is full to the point of bursting?

I don't know how full my stomach should be to feel comfortable. I feel like an idiot.

This is the story with such content.

I'm not sure how full my stomach should be to know I've eaten enough. Is that a strange question?

However, there are quite a few people who have similar concerns.

Let's talk in detail.

The reason for becoming obese is that one eats a lot of food.

However, there is no one who has become obese by forcefully eating a lot.

I ate it because I wanted to.

It was such a large amount that it made me obese.

So, a person who has become obese...

It means that there is a desire to eat so much food that it leads to obesity.

If I didn't have such desires, I wouldn't have eaten enough to become obese.

To diet in this condition,

You have to force yourself to hold back the desire to eat a lot.

The problem is that you can't endure forever.

Whether it's a week, a month, or a year, there will come a moment that becomes unbearable.

If that moment comes and you can't hold back and eat a lot, you will gain weight again.

Most people who have successfully lost weight actually return to their original weight within a year or so.

I am experiencing a yo-yo effect, gaining more weight than before starting my diet.

To solve this problem,

You need to address the desire to eat so much food that it leads to obesity.

Many people believe that appetite is something they are born with.

I originally have a strong appetite, so I eat a lot of food.

I originally like bread.

I usually eat spicy food.

Let's talk like this.

However, the food I eat affects my body.

The desired food and portion size change depending on the condition of my body.

The appetite I have right now may not be something I was born with.

There is an experiment that can determine this.

If you give a rat plain water and sugar water, which one will it drink?

You will drink sugar water.

It's just that sugar water is sweeter and tastier than plain water.

So, what would happen if we give water with artificial sweeteners and sugar water?

What is a sugar substitute?

It is a substance that tastes sweet but has almost no sugar or calories.

It is mainly used in beverages like Diet Coke.

So both water with artificial sweeteners and sugar water have sweetness.

In this situation, what kind of water would a mouse drink?

At first, they drink water from both sides similarly.

As time goes by, I drink more and more sugar water.

The sugar we consume is converted into glucose in our bodies.

It travels through the blood.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is called blood sugar.

Drinking sugar water increases the amount of glucose in the blood, leading to higher blood sugar levels.

On the other hand, while alternative sweeteners do taste sweet,

Because it has almost no sugar and calories, it does not raise blood sugar levels.

The difference in blood sugar changes is why the rat chooses the sugar water.

It's not the sweetness felt on the tongue, but rather a choice made based on the body's response, which is blood sugar.

And this is the same for humans as well.

If you actually follow a diet that restricts carbohydrate intake and end up with a deficiency of carbohydrates,

The desire to eat carbohydrate foods like potatoes, sweet potatoes, and rice is increasing.

Eating carbohydrate-rich foods at this time feels incredibly delicious.

Even people who usually don't like potatoes and sweet potatoes find them delicious.

The same goes for 지방.

To lower calorie intake, try a diet that restricts fat consumption.

I crave high-calorie greasy food.

In addition to this, there was a person who disliked vegetable side dishes made from greens when they were young.

As people age, it is quite common to see them eating vegetable side dishes more often.

My appetite changes depending on the food I eat and my body's condition.

And among foods, there are also those that increase appetite.

So my appetite, which makes me want to eat frequently and in large amounts to the point of becoming obese,

It's not something I was born with.

It could be due to my eating habits.

Refined foods that increase appetite and make you want to eat so much that it leads to obesity.

Food that is not like that is called unrefined food.

Let's remember what we've discussed so far and return to the question from the person who shared their story.

After eating unrefined foods, my appetite has been controlled.

The question from the person sharing their story is about not knowing how much they should eat to feel full.

The reason this happens is that overeating has been considered normal until now.

We have been eating a lot of processed foods since we were young.

When having a meal, it's common to watch dramas, movies, or YouTube.

Among processed foods, there are many refined foods that increase appetite.

Focusing on dramas, movies, or YouTube during meals can block the signals of fullness.

Due to the increased appetite from processed foods, one needs to eat a lot to feel satisfied.

The signals of fullness are blocked, so I can't feel that I'm full.

When you eat so much that you can't eat anymore or

Even if I'm full, if there's food left, I force myself to eat it all.

Even if I'm not hungry, I eat snacks without thinking about it.

If you maintain this kind of diet for a long time, you won't be able to know what moderate eating is.

Until now, I have always overeaten and have never stopped in the middle of eating.

Because my appetite has returned to normal, I am now able to stop in the middle of a meal.

So now I'm wondering whether I should stop eating or if I should eat more.

So how much should I eat?

You need to find it for yourself by trying it out.

If you feel satisfied only when your stomach is completely full, perhaps it's due to habits from the times when you used to overeat.

You can eat like that.

As you keep eating like that, a moment will come when your thoughts change.

It's a bit difficult to explain in words because everyone feels it differently.

For example, let me give a few examples.

In the past, I used to enjoy the feeling of being full after eating a lot of food.

At times, feeling so full can also feel unpleasant.

In the past, even when I wasn't hungry,

When I feel like my stomach is empty, I eat food because I dislike that feeling.

At times, I enjoy the feeling of having an empty stomach, so I endure without eating.

I prepared food in the usual amount that I eat.

As I kept eating, I became full, and since I didn't want to eat anymore, I left some and threw it away.

I am shocked by the fact that I left food uneaten and threw it away.

On the contrary, there are also cases where one feels the need to eat more due to a lack of food.

Through this process, you learn to eat in moderation.

This is very important.

You need to dislike the feeling of being full in order to avoid overeating.

If you leave food uneaten and throw it away, you will end up preparing less food.

You have to like the feeling of an empty stomach so that you don't eat often.

This comes together to change my eating habits and help me eat in moderation.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

The first cause of obesity is eating too much food.

There is no one who becomes obese by forcefully eating a lot of food.

A person who is obese has a strong appetite to eat a large amount of food, enough to become obese.

My appetite changes depending on the second food I eat and my body's condition.

The appetite that leads to obesity can be resolved by improving eating habits.

A person who has long had a lifestyle where overeating is considered normal

When your appetite returns to normal, you may feel confused about how much you should eat.

This is not particularly strange.

You should find the right amount of food for yourself by observing your body's reactions.

I can organize it like this.

Try eating a lot and eating a little to find the right portion size that works for you.

Many people focus only on quick diets without going through this process.

This often leads to yo-yo dieting.

Improving eating habits does not only take place with the food on the table, but also...

It needs to progress in my mind as well.

So what are the unrefined foods that help normalize appetite?

That's the most important thing. Why don't you tell me about it?

In the past, I explained the principles of dieting and talked in detail about refined and unrefined foods.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

You mentioned that watching movies, dramas, or YouTube while eating blocks the signals of fullness.

What is this about?

When eating, if you focus on something other than the food,

There are cases where the signals of fullness are blocked, leading to a lack of feeling full.

So it's better to focus only on the food when you're having a meal.

I explained this in detail in a video as well.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

If you reduce meat and flour, you can live longer, but then there's the saying that if that's the case, there's no reason to live long.

Eating unprocessed foods normalizes appetite.

It seems like it would be nice to be able to eat a lot and still lose weight.

If you tell me not to eat spicy food for the rest of my life, I don't think I can do that.

You can eat spicy food.

In the actual story, it mentions that while eating unrefined foods, they also consumed spicy foods.

It's not saying that you should only eat unrefined foods for a lifetime.

By consuming unrefined foods, I aim to restore my body to its normal state.

It means to eat spicy food without any issues.

I explained this in detail in a video before.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

In the mouse experiment mentioned in the middle, there was a discussion about artificial sweeteners.

There are claims that artificial sweeteners are good for dieting, and there are also claims that they are not.

What do you think?

I previously made a video about artificial sweeteners.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that you're curious about from the ones currently available.
