The Principle and Meaning of Diet Cheating Day - Part 1

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

In this video, I would like to talk about cheat days.

Many people use the term "cheat day," but it is often used with different meanings.

To talk about cheating day because of this, it is necessary to make a distinction.

Broadly, it can be divided into cheating days in bodybuilding and cheating days in dieting.

Let's talk about them one by one.

In bodybuilding, high-intensity exercises are performed to maximize muscle growth.

At the same time, I am trying to reduce body fat as much as possible to increase muscle definition.

Carbohydrates have an impact on both of these factors simultaneously.

Carbohydrates can be stored as glycogen, which is the energy source for muscles, or they can be stored as body fat.

If you continue to consume an appropriate amount of carbohydrates, you can replenish glycogen and perform well in your workouts, but...

Some of those carbohydrates cannot be prevented from being stored as body fat.

Unless you binge on carbohydrates, the amount stored as body fat is not significant.

In a typical diet, consuming carbohydrates in moderation is not an issue.

However, for bodybuilders preparing for a competition, this could be a problem.

Isn't increasing muscle mass and reducing body fat the same for bodybuilding and dieting?

Why is it not a problem in dieting but considered a problem in bodybuilding?

Dieting and bodybuilding have different purposes.

The goal of dieting is to reduce body fat and maintain that state.

So, I aim for a body fat percentage that can be maintained without causing health issues.

For an average man, the goal is to achieve a body fat percentage of 10-15%.

Among Korean celebrities, Kim Jong-kook is famous for his great physique, and his body fat percentage is around 8%.

You can see that around 10 to 15% is sufficient.

However, the target body fat percentage in bodybuilding is much lower than that.

I aim for a body fat percentage of 3-4%, or I try to lower it even further if possible.

Such a low body fat percentage is not good for health, and it is also not easy to maintain that condition.

But why are they trying to lower body fat to such an extreme level?

It's to achieve good results in the competition.

So in dieting, it should be without any health issues.

The goal is to lower body fat percentage only within a sustainable range.

Eating an appropriate amount of carbohydrates is not a problem even if a small amount is converted into body fat.

In bodybuilding, the goal is to continuously reduce body fat in order to achieve good results in competitions.

You become cautious about even a slight increase in body fat.

So what is not a problem in dieting becomes a problem in bodybuilding.

Returning to the original story.

If you follow a low-carbohydrate diet while simultaneously engaging in high-intensity exercise,

The glycogen stored in the body runs out.

In such a situation, if you focus on consuming carbohydrates in a short period of time,

Right now, there is a significant lack of glycogen in the body, so most of the carbohydrates consumed are stored as glycogen.

So, intentionally depleting glycogen and

A method of consuming carbohydrates intensively over a short period of time.

What I'm trying to do is to ensure that the carbohydrates I consume do not turn into body fat but instead become glycogen.

This process is called a cheating day because it feels like you're deceiving your body.

So, the cheating day in bodybuilding is a skill for competitions.

The concept is somewhat different from a cheat day in dieting.

In dieting, cheat days can be further divided into three categories.

The first is a solution to the problems of the calorie diet theory.

The second reason is the days when I can't stick to my diet.

The third day is for relieving the stress caused by dieting.

Let's talk about them one by one.

First, the solution to the problems of the calorie diet theory.

If the calories consumed by the body are greater than the calories obtained from food,

The body uses body fat to make up for the insufficient calories, which is why dieting works.

This is the calorie diet theory.

The theory itself is very simple, so it is not difficult to understand.

At first glance, there seem to be no errors, which is why many people believe in this theory.

However, as I have mentioned several times in other videos, there is an error in this theory.

Eating 100 units of food and in a balanced state where the body consumes 100 units.

If you reduce the amount of food you eat to 50, it will result in a deficit of -50.

Because the body uses fat to make up for this deficiency, weight loss occurs.

For this theory to hold, the calories consumed by the body must be fixed.

Even if you eat 50 units less food, your body always needs to consume 100 units.

However, that's not actually the case. This part indicates an error.

If you eat 50 units of food, your body will also reduce the energy it consumes to 50 in order to maintain balance.

If the energy consumed by the body decreases to 50,

Even if you eat 50 less than usual, you won't lose weight.

Originally, when I ate 100 units of food, I wouldn't gain weight, but now I do.

It is said that this has made it easy to gain weight or that the basal metabolic rate has decreased.

This is a problem that arises when dieting with a low-calorie diet.

There are quite a few people who say that having a cheat day is a way to solve this problem.

When the amount of food consumed is reduced, the energy the body uses decreases.

There are various stories about this phenomenon.

One of the most commonly told stories is about a time when it was difficult to find food.

Ancient human ancestors obtained food through hunting and gathering.

However, one could not always succeed in hunting and gathering.

There must have been times when they failed at hunting and gathering.

And depending on the season and weather, there must have been times when it was difficult to find food.

If the energy consumed by the body is fixed,

Even in difficult times when food is hard to obtain, the same amount of food is needed.

If I couldn't get that food, I would have had no choice but to starve to death.

On the other hand, if we can reduce the energy our bodies consume during times when it is difficult to obtain food,

The amount of food needed decreases, and therefore it becomes possible to survive with less food.

We are currently descendants of those individuals who survived like that.

During times when it is difficult to obtain food, the body tends to reduce the energy it consumes.

So, I'm on a low-calorie diet for weight loss.

Our bodies perceive this as a situation where it is difficult to obtain food.

So it means that the energy consumed by the body decreases.

But what happens if you have a cheat day and eat a lot during that time?

Because we eat a lot, it becomes a time when it is not difficult to obtain food.

Since it is not a difficult time to obtain food, the energy consumed by the body does not decrease.

So, in order to diet, I plan to continue eating less food in the future.

On cheat day, I eat a lot of food, tricking my body into thinking there is no shortage of food.

That means it can prevent the body's metabolism from decreasing.

It sounds plausible, but did it really work?

No, that's not the case.

In fact, there is a very big contradiction in that story.

In the next video, I will discuss what contradictions exist and why cheat days are ineffective.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the cheating day, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making the video.
