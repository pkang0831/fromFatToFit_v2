I have no intention of building muscle and getting in shape to take a body profile photo.

I just want to lose weight, but do I really have to exercise?

A question with this content has been posted.

First, let's read the content of the question.

Hello, pkang.

When dieting, it's often said that you should definitely exercise along with your meal plan.

Of course, it's impressive to see people who build muscle through exercise and take body profile photos, but...

I'm not interested in building muscle or body profiles; I just want to lose some weight.

They say that if you diet without exercising, you will experience a yo-yo effect.

I have two friends around me who are diligently exercising and dieting, but they have experienced weight fluctuations.

I heard that when you get busy and can't exercise, you tend to gain weight again.

I'm honestly not sure if exercise prevents weight regain.

Of course, I know that exercise has many other good effects.

When it comes to dieting, I'm not sure if it's really necessary.

I saw on YouTube that...

There are many people who have achieved a slim and beautiful body just by following a diet without exercising.

Among them, there was someone who had the body shape that I really desire.

If such a body can be achieved without exercise, I wonder if there's really a need to work out.

This is a question about such content. Let's discuss it in detail.

How much do we eat? And how much do we move?

It will be decided based on these two factors.

They say it's about eating habits and lifestyle habits.

I have eating and lifestyle habits that make it easy to gain weight, which is why I am gaining weight.

To lose weight, you need to improve your eating habits and lifestyle.

A diet helps improve eating habits.

Exercise is helpful for improving lifestyle habits.

To lose weight, it is said that you need to focus on diet and exercise.

Wasn't it because of the muscles that you were exercising?

Increasing muscle mass through exercise helps improve lifestyle habits.

There are often cases where emphasis is placed on muscles.

So there are cases where the purpose of diet exercise is misunderstood as increasing muscle mass.

The purpose of exercise in dieting is to improve lifestyle habits.

Even if you worked hard on exercising and dieting,

If lifestyle habits do not improve, the yo-yo effect occurs when you stop exercising.

The questioner's two friends are in this situation.

On the contrary, if there are other methods besides exercise that can improve lifestyle habits,

It doesn't necessarily have to be exercise.

However, exercising is the most efficient.

A trigger is needed for lifestyle changes.

If there is no particular reason, people tend to live similar lives.

For example,

Because I don't love myself, I live a lonely and depressed life.

I met someone who truly loves me, and I started to take care of myself.

While doing work I don't want to do, I continue to go to the company.

After resigning, I started doing what I wanted to do.

To achieve better results, I want to invest more time or

There are times when people lead a regular lifestyle to increase productivity.

Or on the contrary, I originally had good habits.

Breaking up with a partner, changing jobs, or having a major issue arise at home.

I temporarily gained weight due to poor lifestyle habits.

Sometimes, returning to good old habits can lead to weight loss.

So, there was a change in my lifestyle habits due to some circumstances.

If it helps to create and maintain a slim body,

It is possible to achieve a slim and beautiful body just through diet without exercise.

The people featured in the YouTube video mentioned in the question must have had a reason for their changed lifestyle habits.

The problem is that just because I want it, it doesn't mean that such an opportunity suddenly arises.

I can't start a relationship or quit my job just to lose weight.

So, that's why they tell you to exercise.

Basically, when a person moves their body, they experience positive psychological effects.

It has an effect on improving symptoms of depression and anxiety.

And through exercise, if the ability to perform physical activities increases,

In the past, there were things I couldn't do because it was difficult, but now I am able to do them.

I feel a sense of accomplishment here.

As this sense of achievement builds up, I gain confidence that I can do it.

Such mental effects and

Muscles develop and physical strength increases.

When the physical effects that make it easy to move the body combine,

There will be changes in lifestyle habits.

I feel like the time spent lying down and looking at my smartphone is a waste.

You will come to prefer getting up and moving.

I feel that it's better to quickly get done with the tasks I've been putting off out of laziness.

It allows you to actually take on challenges that you only thought about without taking action.

In order to improve the lifestyle habits that made me obese,

I need a significant opportunity that can change my life.

Such opportunities do not arise suddenly just because I want them to.

It needs to be artificially created.

The mental and physical changes brought about by exercise are the easiest triggers to create.

It is telling you to exercise.

If there is another way, you can use that method.

Exercise is the easiest and simplest thing.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

Our bodies are determined by our eating habits and lifestyle choices.

People who are obese typically have issues with their eating habits and lifestyle.

To diet, you need to improve these two things.

Second

A diet has the effect of improving eating habits, and

Exercise has the effect of improving lifestyle habits.

When dieting, it is said that you need to focus on both diet and exercise, but...

If there are ways to improve eating habits and lifestyle other than diet and exercise,

It is not necessary to strictly follow a diet and exercise.

This leads to people dieting without any changes to their diet or exercise.

These people used methods other than diet and exercise.

I didn't lose weight by doing nothing.

Third

To improve your lifestyle habits,

I need a significant turning point that can change my life.

It's difficult for such opportunities to arise exactly when I want them to.

We need to create an opportunity artificially.

Making mental and physical changes through exercise is the simplest way.

If there is no other way, exercising is the most efficient option.

I can organize it like this.

You mentioned that lifestyle changes occur due to the mental and physical effects gained from exercising.

Then... shouldn't the two friends of the person who shared the story also have avoided the yo-yo effect?

Since I exercised while dieting, my lifestyle habits need to change.

There is a high probability that there is a problem with the diet.

Such phenomena occur in people who primarily follow a low-calorie diet while exercising.

I previously made a detailed explanation video because the same question came up.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

Even if you exercise, if there are issues with your diet, it seems that it can have the opposite effect?

So, what should the diet be like?

In the past, I explained the principles of dieting and talked in detail about meal plans.

I will make sure to display related videos in the upper right corner.

It seems like it would be good to improve my lifestyle habits.

It seems like the calories burned that way aren't very significant. Is it meaningful for dieting?

It is sufficiently meaningful.

The calories burned through physical movement are not that important in the first place.

This was also explained in detail in another video.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.
