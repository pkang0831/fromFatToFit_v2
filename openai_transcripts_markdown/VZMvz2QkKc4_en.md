All living beings, including humans, evolve in ways that are advantageous for survival.

Obesity is disadvantageous for survival.

Humans are not originally designed to be obese.

It's something I often talk about.

However, humans are originally designed to become obese.

Humans cannot help but gain weight.

A comment with this content has been posted.

In this video, let's talk about whether that's really the case.

First, I will briefly summarize the content of the comments.

We now obtain a lot of food through livestock farming and agriculture.

Due to the development of storage technology, we can keep a large amount of food for a long time, so food is abundant, but...

Humanity in the past was not able to do that.

Because food was obtained through hunting and gathering, a large amount of food could not be acquired.

Due to poor storage technology, even that food could not be kept for long.

Therefore, for humanity in the past, food scarcity and hunger were commonplace.

An individual that stores as much body fat as possible when consuming food.

So, it means that individuals who easily gain weight had an advantage for survival.

Such entities survived and left descendants, which is why we are who we are today.

It is now natural for us to become obese.

First of all, it is true that in the past, humanity faced food shortages and hunger was a common occurrence.

Therefore, when eating food

It is true that the ability to store some food as body fat has been advantageous for survival.

However, storing as much food as possible as body fat and becoming obese is not advantageous for survival.

The human body is not made that way.

For us now, obtaining food is not a difficult task.

You can just go to the store, pay, and buy it.

However, in the past, humanity had to engage in physical labor, such as hunting and gathering, to obtain food.

An obese body is quite disadvantageous for performing such physical labor.

I successfully hunted and gathered food.

After eating that food, my body fat increased a lot, and I felt heavier.

So, if it becomes difficult to hunt and gather next time, it would actually work against survival.

So, when you eat food, rather than storing as much as possible as body fat,

It is more advantageous for survival to store only a portion, as long as it does not interfere with the next hunting and gathering.

And these characteristics still remain in our bodies today.

When we eat food, a hormone called insulin is released.

One of the functions of this insulin is to increase body fat.

If a person is predisposed to becoming obese and

If you want to store as much body fat as possible when eating food,

Among carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, insulin should be released the most when consuming fats.

Carbohydrates and proteins provide 4 kcal per gram, while fats provide 9 kcal per gram, making their caloric content much higher.

Therefore, rather than storing carbohydrates and proteins as body fat,

Storing fat as body fat is much more efficient.

However, when we actually consume carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, if we check the amount of insulin secreted...

When consuming carbohydrates and proteins, rather than...

The results show that the amount of insulin secreted when consuming fat is significantly lower.

So it's not that the body is designed to store as much body fat as possible.

On the contrary, it's actually the opposite.

It is not that humans are meant to become obese.

If humans are not meant to be obese, why is the population of obese individuals continuing to grow?

It is because the types of food we eat have changed.

It's easier to understand if you think in terms of carbohydrates.

As mentioned earlier, the hormone that increases body fat is insulin.

This insulin also lowers blood sugar levels.

When we eat carbohydrates, those carbohydrates are converted into glucose in the body.

This glucose raises blood sugar levels.

To lower blood sugar, insulin hormone is released.

If you eat a lot of carbohydrates, your blood sugar will rise significantly.

Since you need to lower your blood sugar significantly, a lot of insulin will also be produced.

Simply put, if you eat too many carbohydrates,

It means that an increase in insulin and body fat leads to obesity.

During the period when food was obtained through hunting and gathering, most of the carbohydrates were obtained from vegetables and fruits.

However, the amount of vegetables and fruits obtained through foraging was not very large.

The amount of carbohydrates contained in vegetables and fruits is low.

The amount of carbohydrates I consumed wasn't that much.

In fact, most vegetables and fruits contain less than 10g of carbohydrates per 100g.

However, agriculture began 10,000 years ago, and people started cultivating grains.

In the East, rice is the staple food, while in the West, it is wheat. The food we eat changes.

Grains like rice and wheat contain about 30g of carbohydrates per 100g.

Compared to vegetables and fruits, there are three times more carbohydrates.

Moreover, because it was cultivated through agriculture rather than foraging,

The amount I can eat at once has increased.

I used to live on a small amount of carbohydrates, but now I've changed to being able to eat a lot of carbohydrates.

This is the beginning of the problem.

Many carbohydrates have started to significantly raise blood sugar levels.

In order to lower the significantly elevated blood sugar levels, a lot of insulin needs to be released.

And a lot of insulin has started to significantly increase body fat.

So, does that mean I shouldn't eat grains?

No, that's not the case.

Compared to humanity in the past, we use carbohydrates much more now.

So, people who have a lot of activity or exercise...

It is difficult to obtain all the necessary carbohydrates by only eating vegetables and fruits.

Therefore, in such cases, it is necessary to intentionally eat grains.

What is problematic for us now is processed food rather than grains.

For example, processed foods like ramen contain about 65g of carbohydrates per 100g.

Compared to vegetables and fruits, grains contain much more carbohydrates.

The carbohydrates in processed foods are much higher than those in such grains.

In human history, it is the first time that we have consumed this much carbohydrates.

Because the body could not adapt to this, obesity is occurring as a side effect.

So to summarize...

It is true that in the past, humanity faced food shortages and hunger was a common occurrence.

Therefore, when eating food

It is true that the ability to store some of that food as body fat has been advantageous for survival.

Because the descendants of those who survived are us.

We naturally have these characteristics as well.

However, gaining too much body fat and becoming obese is also detrimental to survival.

Our bodies have characteristics that help prevent excessive increases in body fat.

Therefore, humans are not originally designed to be obese.

The issue is the type of food being eaten.

By changing the types of food you eat, anyone can lose weight.

So I am cursed with this constitution. Humans are originally meant to become obese.

I hope you won't have such negative thoughts.

How should I change the types of food I eat?

You should eat less processed foods compared to what you were eating before.

I explained this in detail in another video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make a video explaining what food to eat in the top left corner.

If you're curious, you can click to see it.

Earlier, you mentioned that we consume more carbohydrates now compared to humanity in the past.

In the past, humanity engaged in physical activities such as hunting and gathering, but

Right now, we are not engaging in such physical activities.

So, isn't it true that ancient humans used a lot more carbohydrates?

If ancient humans were able to obtain sufficient carbohydrates by only eating vegetables and fruits,

Isn't it enough for us to just eat vegetables and fruits right now?

Why do you say that it's not enough?

Carbohydrates are primarily used as energy in the brain and muscles.

Compared to the time of hunting and gathering, our brains are much larger and more developed now.

And there are some differences in the muscles as well.

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a related video.

I will make sure to have a video about carbohydrates appear in the top right.

If you're curious, you can click to see it.

It is said that agriculture began more than 10,000 years ago.

When will I adapt and evolve to the point where I can eat a lot of carbohydrates without gaining weight?

Unfortunately, it cannot evolve that way.

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a related video.

I will make sure that a video about evolution and diet appears in the bottom left.

If you're curious, you can take a look.
