The topic of this video is the diet for severe obesity and the reasons why you often feel hungry.

A comment has been posted regarding the content that is displayed on the left side of the screen.

This is the second response video to the comment question.

If you haven't watched the previous video and don't know the question, please pause the screen and check the question details.

I find your theory convincing and understandable. However, have you ever experienced being overweight in your life?

When hungry, people eat, and when not hungry, they don’t eat, or they follow theories about healthy carbohydrates, which are all great ideas.

But overweight people are always hungry. And they really love refined carbohydrates.

They know it’s not good, but they can’t control themselves. They try to quit and attempt again, but they keep failing.

Even strong-willed people crumble in front of food. Please create useful information about severe obesity as well.

There are two reasons why eating refined carbohydrates leads to an increase in body fat and frequent hunger.

In the previous video, we talked about the issue of blood sugar fluctuations.

If you haven't seen the previous video, you can watch it by clicking the video link in the top right corner.

In this video, I will talk about the second reason, which is the energy conversion issue.

Let me explain about energy conversion.

To convert energy, work must be done from the outside.

Energy conversion processes result in losses.

So, every time energy is converted, there is a characteristic that the total amount of energy decreases.

To help with understanding, let me give you an example.

When there is an energy of 100

If you want to convert this energy into fat and store it,

The body needs to convert energy into fat.

And assuming the loss is 10,

The energy of 100 will be stored as 90 in fat.

If you want to convert this 90 grams of fat back into energy for use,

Our body needs to convert fat into energy.

Since there is also a loss, 90 units of fat become 80 units of energy.

When converting energy to fat and fat to energy

The body needs to keep working, but the total amount of energy tends to decrease.

This process is very inefficient, so the body does not like it.

So when the body is low on energy, rather than converting fat into energy,

I prefer to send hunger signals to eat new foods.

This is one of the reasons why dieting is difficult.

When the body lacks energy, it can use fat, but since you feel hungry and want to eat...

However, there may be some people who are thinking this after hearing all of this.

If the process of converting fat into energy is inefficient, then dieting is difficult.

Since the process of converting energy into fat is not very efficient, shouldn't it be difficult to become obese?

This is also correct, but there is another issue.

I mentioned that the reason for gaining weight is due to refined carbohydrates.

Refined carbohydrates have the characteristic of rapidly raising blood sugar levels.

If blood sugar levels remain high, inflammation occurs in the blood vessel walls.

It is better to have inefficient energy conversion than to have inflammation.

So, energy is converted into fat, which increases body fat.

On the contrary, it's difficult for fat to be converted into energy.

This is the basic rule of energy conversion.

Then, let's explore how the energy conversion issue creates hunger.

Let's assume that the body needs 100 units of energy.

I needed energy, so I ate 100 units of food.

If the food you ate contains refined carbohydrates, your blood sugar will increase rapidly.

A certain amount of what you eat, out of 100, is stored as fat.

For example, let's assume that 30 has been stored.

Due to losses, the actual amount of fat stored will be less than 30.

I ate food worth 100, but 30 of it turned into fat, so the energy I can use in my body now is 70.

I need 100, but I only have 70, so I'm lacking energy.

To replenish this insufficient energy,

There is a way to extract energy from fat or to send hunger signals to eat new food.

Due to energy conversion issues, our bodies prefer new food over using fat.

So when you eat refined carbohydrates, you may feel hungry again shortly after consuming enough food.

The biggest difference between the energy conversion problem and the blood sugar drop problem mentioned in the previous video is

I want to eat sweet foods to raise my blood sugar, even though I don't lack energy due to blood sugar fluctuations.

The energy conversion problem makes us crave high-calorie fatty foods because of a lack of energy.

However, I explained it in parts.

The cause of these two problems is refined carbohydrates, right?

I consumed refined carbohydrates, which caused my blood sugar to rise, leading to these two problems.

Eating refined carbohydrates leads to two problems occurring simultaneously.

So I want to eat greasy food and sweet food as well.

In other words, if I can cut out refined carbohydrates, then this problem wouldn't exist.

You won't experience frequent hunger, and you can easily manage your diet.

Sounds plausible, right?

The link to the next video is displayed in the top right corner.

In the next video, we will discuss tips on how to easily cut out refined carbohydrates.
