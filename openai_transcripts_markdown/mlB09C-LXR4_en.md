Is it possible to have good digestion but not gain weight?

A question has come up regarding the relationship between digestion, absorption, and dieting, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the content of the question.

I've always been curious about you, Ronka.

They say that foods that are slow to digest and absorb, like brown rice and vegetables, are good for dieting.

However, there is a saying that drinking water during meals hinders digestion and absorption, leading to weight gain.

Foods high in fat, like chicken and pizza, are so difficult to digest that they can even cause diarrhea when eaten.

This is said to be food that makes you gain weight.

People who have low visceral fat and a healthy body tend to have active metabolism in their digestive system.

It is said that I digest and absorb food well, but I am not considered to have a body type that easily gains weight.

I don't understand how these contradictory stories come to be.

What is the relationship between digestion, absorption, and dieting?

This is the kind of question I'm asking. Let's discuss it in detail.

When two logics conflict with each other and cannot both be true at the same time, it is called a contradiction.

Once upon a time, a merchant sold spears and shields.

When selling the spear, it was said that this spear can pierce through anything.

When selling the shield, it was said that this shield can block anything.

What happens if you stab your shield with your spear at this moment? This question arose, and

The merchant could not answer.

Because if the spear pierces the shield, the claim that it is a shield that can block anything becomes false.

If the spear cannot pierce the shield, then the claim that it is a spear that can pierce anything becomes false.

A spear that can pierce through anything and a shield that can block anything cannot exist simultaneously.

This is called a contradiction.

Foods that are slow to digest and absorb, like brown rice and vegetables, are good for dieting.

If this story is true,

It seems that things that are not easily digested and absorbed would be good for dieting.

On the contrary, things that are easily digested and absorbed seem likely to lead to weight gain.

If drinking water during meals hinders digestion and absorption, it should be good for dieting.

Why do people say they gain weight?

Foods that are very high in fat, like chicken and pizza, are difficult to digest to the point that they can cause diarrhea when eaten.

It should be food that is good for dieting.

Why are certain foods fattening?

People who have low visceral fat and are healthy, with an active metabolism in their digestive system, tend to digest and absorb well.

Since digestion and absorption are good, it seems like it would be easy to gain weight.

Why is that not the case?

It seems like there is a contradiction in the logic regarding digestion, absorption, and dieting.

To conclude, it is not a contradiction.

They say running is good for your health.

However, to someone who is sick and unable to walk properly,

If you say that running is good for health and encourage someone to run, what will happen?

Rather, it will likely worsen your health.

For the statement "Running is good for health" to hold true,

A minimum level of health is required to be able to run.

The same goes for dieting.

As mentioned in the question.

The foods that we commonly say are good for dieting are

It is a rough food that is difficult to digest and absorb, like grains or vegetables.

For the statement "rough food helps with dieting" to hold true,

There needs to be a digestive system capable of digesting and absorbing that rough food.

If a person has a weak digestive system and cannot digest food well,

What happens if you eat rough food?

You cannot properly digest and absorb food, and that causes problems.

It's actually not good for dieting.

If digestion and absorption don't occur, the nutrients that enter the body will be minimal even if you eat.

Then isn't it good for dieting?

It's not good.

If you eat too much food, the excess nutrients that enter your body can lead to weight gain.

So, is it good for dieting to not eat and starve, resulting in no nutrients entering the body?

That's not the case.

If we go without food and starve, our body perceives the situation as one where it is difficult to obtain food.

In order to avoid starving to death, I try to conserve body fat as much as possible.

Reduce the energy consumed by the body.

If you eat food, you try to store it as body fat as much as possible.

It is becoming a body that easily gains weight.

This is called the hunger response.

So if you lose weight by starving yourself, you may lose weight initially, but...

As time goes by, even if you eat less, you won't lose weight.

When you stop dieting, you experience a yo-yo effect where you gain more weight than your original weight.

There are many discussions about how you shouldn't starve yourself to lose weight because of this.

If you eat rough food when your digestive system is weak,

Because the body cannot properly digest and absorb, the nutrients that enter the body become limited.

This is no different from starving the body, and that's why it's said to be bad for dieting.

If having too many nutrients is a problem, and having too few nutrients is also a problem, then...

What should I do?

Let's think about growing plants with a machine that automatically waters them.

This machine is broken.

When the machine is turned on, it gives too much water, causing the plant's roots to rot and die.

If you turn off the machine, it won't water the plants, and if they dry out, they will die.

Whether you turn the machine on or off, the plants die.

So what should we do?

The problem lies in the extremes of either giving too much water or not giving any water at all.

You just need to fix the machine so that it provides the right amount of water.

The same goes for dieting.

Eating foods that are high in nutritional density and are quickly digested and absorbed...

Too many nutrients enter the body in a short period of time, and this causes weight gain.

On the contrary, if you don't eat or eat too little,

When the nutrients entering the body are insufficient, it leads to a feeling of hunger.

To lose weight,

I eat a sufficient amount of food, but I consume foods that are slow to digest and absorb.

Nutrients should be absorbed into the body slowly.

This is why foods that are slow to digest and absorb, like brown rice or vegetables, are said to be good for dieting.

So, a person with low visceral fat and a healthy body, whose digestive system is active, is...

When eating rough foods that are good for dieting, there are no issues with digestion or absorption.

This helps with dieting.

On the other hand, people with weak digestive systems...

Rough food cannot be properly digested and absorbed, which causes problems.

You may experience abdominal pain or diarrhea.

Because the body cannot properly digest and absorb, a hunger response can occur.

In this case, there will be no issues with digestion and absorption even with a weak digestive system.

The desire for foods that are small in volume but high in calories, and that are quickly digested and absorbed, becomes stronger.

To put it simply,

I don't want to eat diet foods like brown rice or vegetables.

It means that you start to crave foods like snacks or cake.

This would obviously not be good for dieting.

In reality, losing weight by starving oneself or following a low-calorie diet.

People with a low basal metabolic rate and weakened digestive systems.

There are quite a few cases where people show a strong obsession with foods like snacks or cakes.

You say you're going to diet, but you are restricting calories.

I just can't give up on snacks and cake.

There are cases where people skip meals and only eat snacks and cake.

Let's remember what we've discussed so far and return to the question that was posed at the beginning of the video.

Foods like brown rice and vegetables are good for dieting because they are digested and absorbed slowly.

However, to eat such rough foods, a healthy body that digests and absorbs well is necessary.

So I have low visceral fat and my body is healthy.

A body with an active metabolism in the digestive system that digests and absorbs well.

It's not about having a body that easily gains weight, but rather becoming a body that is good for dieting.

If drinking water during meals interferes with digestion and absorption, it is said to be bad for dieting.

Lastly, foods like chicken and pizza are

There is so much fat that it's hard to digest, to the point that I get diarrhea after eating it.

Why are foods like this considered fattening?

This has an answer to the question.

It's because there is too much fat.

It has a high nutritional density and is quickly digested and absorbed.

Foods that provide too many nutrients to the body in a short amount of time are considered fattening foods.

Chicken and pizza are exactly that kind of food.

That's why it's called fattening food.

People who experience diarrhea when eating chicken or pizza in the first place

It's not that chicken and pizza are rough foods that cause diarrhea.

It is because there is too much fat that I am experiencing diarrhea, so there is a difference compared to brown rice and vegetables.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

Foods that are high in nutritional density and are quickly digested and absorbed are

Having too many nutrients enter the body in a short period of time is a cause of obesity.

For dieting,

Foods that are high in nutrient density but are slow to digest and absorb.

You need to eat foods that are quickly digestible and absorbable, but have low nutritional density.

This type of food is called coarse food or unrefined food.

Second

People with weak digestive systems find it difficult to digest and absorb coarse foods.

You may develop a rejection response, making you lose your appetite or not want to eat.

Even if you force yourself to eat, it's hard to see proper results.

Third

Eating rough foods does not cause any problems with digestion or absorption.

A healthy person with a strong digestive system is advantageous for dieting.

Rough foods that are difficult to digest and absorb are said to be good for dieting.

A person with a strong digestive system has an advantage when it comes to dieting.

It does not contradict.

I can organize it like this.

So, to diet, you don't have to eat less or starve yourself.

So you have to eat rough food?

So, what is rough food?

In a previous video about the principles of dieting, I explained in detail what foods you should eat.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

People with weakened digestive systems become obsessed with snacks.

You mentioned that there are cases where people skip meals to eat snacks.

I'm in exactly that situation. What should I do?

In the past, a similar concern was shared, and I explained in detail through a video what should be done.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

You said that eating less or starving to lose weight makes it easier to gain weight back.

If that's the case, it seems like eating a lot and gaining weight makes it easier to lose weight.

Shouldn't there be an opposing mechanism?

Yes, that's right. There is actually such a mechanism.

I explained this in detail in a video before.
