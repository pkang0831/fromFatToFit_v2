Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video created in response to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the content of the question.

Based on aesthetics and physical health, is bodyweight training better?

In the first part of the video, we talked about it from a cool perspective.

In this video, I will discuss from a health perspective.

Since this is a continuation of the video from Part 1,

If you have not watched Part 1 of the video, you may have difficulty understanding the content.

The video link is available in the top right corner.

I recommend that those who haven't watched Part 1 of the video go and watch it.

From a health perspective, bodyweight exercises are better than weight training.

There are three main reasons why I think this way.

One is the side effects caused by medication.

The two are experiencing excess protein due to supplements.

The third is injuries caused by heavy weights.

However, all three of these arise from the preconceived notions about muscle size mentioned in Part 1.

A considerable number of people search for and view bodybuilders' physiques on the internet.

If you do weight training, I believe you can achieve that kind of body.

In the first part of the video, it was mentioned that this is not actually the case.

Because in order to build such a body, one must rely on the power of drugs.

Does that mean all bodybuilders use drugs?

No, that's not the case.

If there are two people who have really worked hard on their exercise during the same period,

There is a huge difference between those who have taken the medication and those who have not.

Human memory has the characteristic of clearly remembering stimuli that are stronger.

In other words, when comparing bodybuilders who use drugs to those who do not.

The body of a bodybuilder who uses drugs has much larger muscles.

I have a strong memory of a bodybuilder who was on steroids.

That's why the perception of bodybuilders remains that way. Not all bodybuilders use drugs.

To make the explanation easier, I will refer to bodybuilders who use drugs as "roiders."

Let's return to the original story.

As a result, people develop a preconceived notion that connects Lloyd's body with weight training.

If we interpret this prejudice in a positive way,

If you do weight training, you might think that your muscles will grow like a bodybuilder's.

If this prejudice is interpreted negatively,

If you do weight training, I think health issues will arise, just like with a roider.

However, Roider's health issue is due to medication side effects, not problems caused by weight training.

If you do weight training without using drugs, you won't be able to have muscles as big as a bodybuilder's.

Since I do not use drugs, there are no side effects.

Excess protein due to the second supplement.

This is also a problem that arises from preconceived notions.

If you think that doing weight training will give you big muscles like a bodybuilder,

No matter how hard I work out, my muscles don't grow satisfactorily.

It's an unavoidable situation because I don't use drugs.

There are cases where people try to resolve this with supplements.

To build muscle, three things are necessary: exercise, rest, and nutrition.

I am really working hard on my exercise and also getting enough rest.

The reason why muscles don't grow is thought to be a problem with nutrition.

And since protein is needed to build muscle,

I think my muscles haven't grown because I haven't been eating enough protein.

So, you start looking for protein supplements.

However, even if you take protein supplements, you won't grow as big as a bodybuilder.

It's natural because there are no drugs.

I wonder if I'm lacking protein since my body isn't growing, so I'm trying to eat more and more.

Consuming a large amount of protein continuously is ultimately not good for your health.

However, this is also a problem that arises from consuming too much protein, and it is not an issue related to weight training itself.

I try to obtain protein through food.

If it is difficult to obtain through food, then it is acceptable to rely on supplements to some extent.

You can engage in weight training without health issues caused by excessive protein.

Injury due to the third weight.

I mentioned it in a video comparing bodyweight exercises and weight training.

Bodyweight exercises increase the load by changing positions.

Weight training uses a method where the posture is fixed while only the weight is increased.

This is what causes the difference to arise.

Bodyweight exercises require learning new difficult positions to increase the load.

You need to develop all the muscles required to maintain that posture in order to increase the load.

So, inevitably, the load gradually increases.

On the contrary, with weight training, after learning the initial posture and finding the points of stimulation,

You can keep the same posture and just increase the weight.

You don't need to learn a new posture every time; you just need to add weight.

You can quickly increase the load as much as the user wants.

The ability to quickly increase the load can be an advantage, but

One downside is that many people get injured by trying to lift weights that are too heavy.

As mentioned earlier, in order for muscles to grow, three things are necessary: exercise, rest, and nutrition.

If I think the reason my muscles aren't satisfactorily large is due to nutrition, I will look for supplements.

If you think the cause is that the exercise intensity is low, you will try to increase the load quickly.

Due to the nature of weight training, the load can be increased quickly.

In this process, there are many cases of getting injured from overexerting during exercise.

However, this is also a fixation on large muscles that stems from preconceived notions.

The problem arises from excessively increasing the weight, not from the weight training itself.

If you don't push yourself too hard, you can do weight training without getting injured.

I will summarize.

If you do weight training, you can have a body like a bodybuilder.

Or, Royder's body was built through years of weight training.

The ideal body I aim for can be achieved by doing weight training diligently for a few months.

Exercising excessively with such prejudices can be harmful to your health.

However, this is the result of excessive exercise, not an issue with weight training itself.

If you let go of the desire and preconceived notions of quickly building muscle and exercise without overdoing it,

Regardless of whether it's weight training or bodyweight exercises, you can achieve a healthy and great-looking body.

Sounds plausible, right?
