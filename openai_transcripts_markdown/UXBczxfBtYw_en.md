Hello, this is pkang.

There was a question in the comments asking what I think about doing cardio on an empty stomach.

To answer this question, we need to start with a discussion about aerobic and anaerobic exercise.

So, the story will unfold over a total of three videos.

This video is part one of a series.

Let's find out which type of exercise, aerobic or anaerobic, is more effective for burning body fat.

If we interpret the terms themselves, aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise...

Aerobic exercise is exercise that involves breathing, while anaerobic exercise is exercise that does not involve breathing.

Is it possible to exercise without breathing?

When lifting a heavy object, you hold your breath while lifting.

There is also the claim that strength training or weightlifting, which involves lifting heavy objects, is an anaerobic exercise.

Holding your breath is just a few seconds of lifting an object.

At other times, I continue to breathe.

The moment you stop breathing can be considered anaerobic exercise, but...

After that, it changes to aerobic exercise while breathing.

And if the weight of the object being lifted is not too heavy,

Maintaining a steady breath while lifting and lowering, it can be considered aerobic exercise in terms of breathing.

So it means that aerobic and anaerobic are mixed together.

And in the case of running, which is a representative form of aerobic exercise,

When running slowly, it is possible to maintain a steady breathing pattern, but...

If you sprint as fast as possible, you will end up holding your breath while running.

So all exercises are a mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercises.

As the intensity increases, the proportion of anaerobic exercise also increases.

As the intensity decreases, the proportion of aerobic exercise increases.

So in the past, it was said that "the terms aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise are incorrect."

It should be referred to as low-intensity exercise and high-intensity exercise. There have been discussions about this.

The terms aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise are already widely used.

In the process of changing this, confusion keeps arising.

Recently, low-intensity exercise that allows for maintaining a steady breath is referred to as aerobic exercise.

High-intensity exercise that makes it difficult to maintain a steady breath is called anaerobic exercise.

The concepts of aerobic and anaerobic are complex and difficult to explain, so let's skip them.

According to people's perceptions, running, jumping rope, and cycling are considered aerobic exercises.

Strength training or weight training is also referred to as anaerobic exercise.

The terminology is the same, but depending on the person, it is interpreted and used in slightly different ways.

So when you look at information about aerobic and anaerobic exercise,

You need to first understand what this person means by the term.

I find it difficult to maintain a steady breath during high-intensity anaerobic exercise.

Exercise that allows you to maintain a steady breathing pattern is called low-intensity aerobic exercise.

To build muscle, it is commonly said that you should do anaerobic exercises, meaning high-intensity workouts.

To lose body fat, it is advisable to do aerobic exercise, which means low-intensity workouts.

There are many cases where this is understood like this.

The reason for this claim is due to the proportion of body fat used during exercise.

The human body stores two types of energy: carbohydrates and fats.

Carbohydrates can quickly increase or decrease usage.

It is the energy used when a lot of strength is suddenly needed.

On the contrary, fat cannot be quickly increased or decreased in usage.

It is energy that is used consistently in a specific place.

Internal organs such as the heart, lungs, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine constantly consume energy 24 hours a day.

The energy consumed by these internal organs primarily comes from body fat.

The energy used by the internal organs is called the basal metabolic rate.

So, it's said that you need to increase your basal metabolic rate to avoid gaining weight.

So, the human body is always consuming a certain amount of body fat.

When you start exercising, you suddenly need energy for the workout.

Because fat cannot be increased in usage quickly,

First, exercise using carbohydrates that can quickly increase your energy levels.

The structure involves gradually increasing the use of fats to replace carbohydrates.

There used to be a belief that you had to exercise for more than 30 minutes for fat to be burned.

As the usage of body fat increases, the usage of carbohydrates gradually decreases.

The point at which the usage of carbohydrates and body fat intersects is around 20 to 30 minutes.

Please remember this up to this point, and I will compare low-intensity exercise and high-intensity exercise.

Low-intensity exercise has a low level of intensity, so it does not consume a lot of energy.

Depending on weight and speed, there are differences, but walking typically burns about 200 kcal per hour.

Because the energy consumed is low, even a slight increase in the use of body fat can...

Most of the energy needed for exercise can be supplied by body fat.

So the ratio of energy consumed is about 30% from carbohydrates and 70% from fats.

High-intensity exercise has a high level of intensity, which means it consumes a lot of energy.

Depending on weight and speed, running burns about 600 kcal per hour.

Because a lot of energy is consumed, the usage of body fat needs to be increased significantly.

Body fat cannot be quickly increased in usage.

The proportion of carbohydrates in energy usage is much higher.

So the ratio of energy consumed is about 70% from carbohydrates and 30% from fats.

Looking at the proportion of body fat in energy consumption,

Low-intensity exercise has 70% body fat, while high-intensity exercise has 30% body fat.

If we base it on the ratio of body fat usage,

Low-intensity exercise is more effective for reducing body fat than high-intensity exercise.

Based on this information, there is a claim that walking is better for dieting than running.

However, the body fat consumed during low-intensity exercise is 70% of 200 kcal, which is 140 kcal.

The body fat consumed during high-intensity exercise is 180 kcal, which is 30% of 600 kcal.

If we base it on the actual body fat consumed rather than the ratio,

High-intensity exercise consumes more body fat than low-intensity exercise.

For reference, if you exercise at a moderate intensity between low-intensity and high-intensity workouts,

The calories burned through exercise amount to 400 kcal.

The ratio of carbohydrate to body fat usage is 50% carbohydrates and 50% body fat.

In this case, the actual fat consumed is about 200 kcal, which is 50% of 400 kcal.

The amount of body fat burned during exercise is highest with moderate-intensity workouts.

Looking at it this way, moderate-intensity exercise can be considered the best for reducing body fat.

However, in the case of high-intensity exercise, there is additional body fat being consumed.

In the case of body fat, it was mentioned that the amount cannot be quickly increased or decreased.

The amount of body fat used, which increases with exercise, does not decrease immediately but rather decreases slowly.

So after the workout is finished

While the amount of body fat being used decreases, fat continues to be burned.

This is called the afterburn effect.

In the case of low-intensity exercise, the amount of body fat used increases slightly.

The time it takes to come down is short, and the afterburn effect is weak.

On the contrary, in the case of high-intensity exercise, the amount of body fat used increases significantly.

It takes a long time to come back down, and the afterburn effect is strong.

So, when comparing low-intensity exercise and high-intensity exercise,

The amount of body fat burned during exercise is greater with high-intensity workouts.

The amount of body fat burned after exercise is greater with high-intensity workouts.

Therefore, high-intensity exercise is more effective for fat loss than low-intensity exercise.

And when comparing moderate-intensity exercise to high-intensity exercise,

The amount of body fat burned during exercise is greater with moderate-intensity workouts, but...

The afterburn effect is stronger because high-intensity exercise is more intense.

Considering the total amount of body fat consumed, high-intensity exercise is better than moderate-intensity exercise.

Sounds plausible, right?

Then, a question may arise: "Is weight training better than running for reducing body fat?"

That's not the case.

Low intensity and high intensity are not types of exercise, but rather determined by the intensity of the exercise.

The link to the next video should be appearing in the top right corner.

I will talk about this in detail in the next video.
