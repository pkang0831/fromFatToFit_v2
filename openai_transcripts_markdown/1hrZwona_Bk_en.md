I exercise for 3 to 4 hours a day, but I'm not losing weight.

I've been seeing a lot of comments like this, so I wanted to have a discussion about it.

The way we exercise changes depending on the purpose of the exercise.

The usual goal of people who exercise is to increase muscle mass.

So I exercise using a progressive overload method.

As your body becomes stronger through exercise, this is a way to increase the intensity of the workout.

Because the intensity of the exercise increases, the duration of the exercise is often consistent.

Usually, when I exercise for about an hour with focus, I increase the intensity until my muscles are fatigued.

I exercise for 3 to 4 hours a day.

This means that the intensity of the exercise is low enough to be able to work out for 3 to 4 hours.

So it's about exercising at a low intensity for a long time.

This is the problem.

The way we exercise changes depending on the purpose of the exercise.

The method of exercising for a long time at a low intensity is

When the goal of exercise is calorie burning, this is the method that is mainly chosen.

Increasing the intensity of exercise also increases the calories burned.

Why do people insist on exercising for a long time at a low intensity?

When you increase the intensity of exercise, you may not want other effects to occur.

It's because I want to increase the intensity of my exercise, but I can't.

When talking about progressive overload, it was mentioned that increasing the intensity of exercise leads to an increase in muscle mass.

However, there are people who do not want this.

When muscle mass increases through exercise, the body becomes thicker and larger accordingly.

You don't want that kind of body.

I want to have a slim and small body by only losing body fat without increasing muscle mass.

So, while doing low-intensity exercise to prevent muscle mass from increasing,

The goal is to increase exercise time to burn a lot of calories and reduce body fat.

When you want to increase the intensity of your workouts but can't, it is mainly due to issues with your diet.

People whose goal of exercise is calorie burning

There is a high probability that you are dieting according to the calorie diet theory.

When I compare the calories I get from food to the calories my body consumes,

If the calories obtained from food are higher, it leads to a state of calorie surplus.

Excess calories that remain are stored as body fat, leading to weight gain.

On the contrary, if the calories consumed by the body are greater, it will result in a calorie deficit state.

You lose weight by burning body fat to make up for the insufficient calories.

This is the theory of calorie dieting.

To create a calorie deficit, you need to either reduce your food intake or exercise more.

It is easier to reduce the amount of food you eat than to exercise a lot.

So usually, I first reduce the amount of food I eat. I'm following a low-calorie diet.

The problem is that when you reduce your food intake, your body becomes weak, making it difficult to exercise.

Even if I want to increase the intensity of my exercise, I can't because I don't have the strength.

I understand the reason for exercising at a low intensity for a long time, but why isn't the weight loss happening?

The intensity of the exercise is low, so the calories burned are also low.

The longer you exercise, the more calories you burn.

Then shouldn't the weight be lost?

Unfortunately, that's not the case.

There are two main reasons.

The first reason is that if you repeat the same intensity of exercise, the calories burned gradually decrease.

The second reason is that if you continue to exercise consistently, you prepare the energy needed for the workout in advance.

Those who have tried exercising will know that

If you exercise consistently, the workouts that were difficult at first will gradually become easier.

A typical example is the 30-day squat challenge.

On the first day, even 30 squats are tough.

If I can do 200 squats on the last day,

Now, doing 30 squats will no longer be a difficult task.

As you get used to exercising, the calories you burn gradually decrease.

And when a person who hasn't exercised starts working out,

Because it is an unexpected calorie expenditure, it uses body fat as emergency food.

If you consistently exercise and continuously burn calories,

In such situations, you prepare the calories needed for exercise in advance.

For these two reasons, exercising at a low intensity for a long time is not very effective for dieting.

Even if you burn calories through exercise, if body fat doesn't decrease...

Is exercise not necessary for dieting?

No, that's not the case.

The body fat in our bodies is divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat based on its location and function.

The body fat that decreases when you burn calories is exactly this visceral fat.

It is difficult to lose this visceral fat through exercise.

To reduce visceral fat, focusing on diet is more effective than exercise.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is the type of body fat that effectively decreases when muscle mass increases and activity levels rise.

Therefore, it is necessary to exercise in order to reduce body fat.

So, it's not about burning calories; you need to exercise to increase muscle mass in order to lose weight.

So, exercising at a low intensity for 3 to 4 hours does not lead to an increase in muscle mass and does not result in weight loss.

Exercising with progressive overload to increase muscle mass leads to weight loss.

If we summarize the content so far in five points:

The statement about exercising for 3 to 4 hours a day means that...

This means that the intensity of the exercise is low enough to be sustained for 3 to 4 hours.

If you repeat the same intensity of exercise a second time, the calories burned from that exercise will gradually decrease.

If you consistently engage in the third exercise and continue to expend energy,

The body prepares energy in advance for the exercise needed in such situations.

Even if you burn calories through exercise for these two reasons, body fat does not decrease easily.

The fifth type of body fat in our body is

Depending on the location and the function, it is divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

When you increase muscle mass and activity levels through exercise, subcutaneous fat decreases.

If you are exercising for the purpose of dieting, you should focus on exercising to increase muscle mass.

Therefore, instead of exercising for 3 to 4 hours a day at a low intensity,

It is advisable to gradually increase the intensity of your workouts through progressive overload.

I can organize it like this.

But does the number of calories burned through exercise really decrease if you keep exercising?

In fact, the daily calorie expenditure of traditional tribes that engage in hunting and gathering, which involves a lot of physical activity, and

When comparing the daily calorie expenditure of Westerners who spend most of their time sitting,

There were also results showing that there was no difference.

There was a question about this part before, so I made a video explaining it in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top left.

If you are curious about this part, you can click to see it.

If you exercise consistently, your body prepares calories in advance.

So you said that even if you burn calories through exercise, you don't lose weight.

Isn't it because you exercised and then ate everything you wanted because you were hungry?

Even if you control your meal portions, you will still secure the calories needed for exercise in various ways.

This question came up before, and I made a video answering it.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right.

If you are curious, you can click here to see.

You mentioned that increasing muscle mass and activity levels will help reduce subcutaneous fat.

What is subcutaneous fat and why do we need to exercise to lose it?

I made a video about this before and explained it in detail.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

But what should I do if my muscles get too big from training with progressive overload?

I don't want to have a big, muscular body; I just want to have a slim body.

Just because you exercise doesn't mean that you will immediately gain 10kg or 20kg of muscle and your body will get bigger.

By gradually increasing the load, the intensity rises little by little, and muscle mass also increases gradually.

First, gradually increase the intensity of your workouts while also slightly increasing your muscle mass.

Once I achieve the body I am satisfied with, you can maintain the same level of exercise intensity.

Doing it that way won't increase muscle mass, so the body won't grow.

However, I have a body type that easily builds muscle.

I tried to exercise and got personal training, but my thighs got thicker right away.

I had an InBody test done.

I don't have any experience with exercise, but I've been told that I have a lot of muscle mass for a woman.

When I tell this story, no one believes me, but it's true.

First of all, even if you are a woman, your thighs can become thicker when you exercise.

However, if you keep at it consistently, it will become thin again.

This is a frequently asked question, so I made a video about it in the past.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right corner.
