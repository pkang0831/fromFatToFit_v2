Diet cola can raise blood sugar levels and change your body into one that gains weight (artificial sweeteners, substitute sweeteners).

There are many questions about the alternative party.

In this video, I would like to talk about alternative sweeteners.

The cause of obesity is overeating, which means consuming too much food.

In the past, I thought that overeating and consuming too many calories was the problem.

I thought that limiting the intake of high-calorie fats would help with dieting.

However, the blood sugar rises too quickly and then drops again.

It has been revealed that blood sugar spikes lead to overeating.

To diet, you should reduce processed refined carbohydrates that raise blood sugar too quickly.

This thought took root.

The representative refined carbohydrate that quickly raises blood sugar is sugar.

As a result, there has been increased interest in alternative sweeteners that provide sweetness instead of sugar.

The substitute sweetener provides sweetness, but it has no calories and does not raise blood sugar levels.

I thought it would help with my diet.

However, in reality, it is not like that.

Isn't it true that the substitute sweeteners have no calories and do not raise blood sugar?

I personally drank zero cola with a substitute sweetener and also measured my blood sugar.

My blood sugar hasn't risen at all.

That's right.

Blood sugar refers to the concentration of glucose in the blood.

Eating food will raise it.

For example, the carbohydrates we eat are converted into glucose in the body.

This glucose moves through the blood.

In that process, blood sugar levels increase.

So, for blood sugar to rise, the amount of glucose needs to increase.

The sweeteners used in Diet Coke are hundreds of times sweeter than sugar.

Use a very small amount.

Even that small amount of alternative sugar is not digested or absorbed.

I cannot obtain glucose.

So it's correct that alternative sweeteners have no calories and do not raise blood sugar levels.

However, it is possible for blood sugar levels to rise indirectly due to the substitute ingredients.

Because we cannot digest or absorb alternative sugars,

The microorganisms in our gut can break down alternative sugars.

There are countless microorganisms living in the intestines of the human body.

This is called gut microbiota.

These gut microorganisms have a significant impact on our body's hormone metabolism.

The composition and activity of gut microorganisms can lead to changes in the body.

Among twins with matching genetic information,

Mice that received gut microbiota transplants from obese individuals gradually became obese.

There are experiments where mice that received gut microbiota transplants from non-obese individuals did not become obese.

The composition of gut microorganisms that leads to obesity actually exists.

The food we ate passes through the intestines during the digestion process.

Intestinal microorganisms obtain their food here.

The composition of gut microorganisms changes depending on what food is consumed.

The sweetener in Diet Coke is not digested or absorbed.

Intestinal microorganisms can break down alternative sweeteners, and this is where problems arise.

What happens when gut microorganisms break down alternative sweeteners?

My blood sugar is rising.

There was actually an experiment conducted on rats.

When the rats were continuously fed with alternative substances,

As glucose processing ability decreases, insulin resistance develops.

The results showed that blood sugar levels have increased.

Although alternative sweeteners do not directly raise blood sugar levels, they can have an indirect effect.

Of course, the results of rat experiments cannot be directly applied to humans.

In fact, similar experiments were conducted on people, but...

The results have not been consistent.

Why are the results not consistent?

There are various possibilities.

The most likely reason is that the composition of gut microbiota varies from person to person.

The number of microorganisms in the human gut is in the tens of trillions, and there are hundreds of different species.

It changes depending on the food I eat.

The composition of gut microbiota varies for each person.

The composition of gut microorganisms is different, so it doesn't come out consistently.

In experiments involving mice,

A method for transplanting gut microbiota into germ-free mice.

It is possible to standardize the gut microbiota for experiments.

You can't do that to people.

Well, there are people whose blood sugar rises when they drink Diet Coke.

Are there people who are not?

Yes, that's right.

However, right now, there are people whose blood sugar does not rise.

If you consistently consume alternative sweeteners, there is a possibility that it could become a problem.

Gut microorganisms survive by feeding on the food I eat.

I mentioned that the composition of gut microbes changes depending on the food I eat.

Then what happens if you continue to consume the substitute?

This means that the composition of gut microbiota can change accordingly.

Even someone who is not a problem right now

If the composition of gut microorganisms changes over time, it can become a problem.

In fact, after continuously consuming artificial sweeteners, my blood sugar levels increased, and insulin was released.

Such stories have existed long before this.

However, as mentioned at the beginning of the video,

The substitute food is consumed in very small amounts, and that small amount is not digested or absorbed.

If glucose cannot be obtained from alternative sources, how does blood sugar increase?

I couldn't explain this.

So when you taste sweetness on your tongue, your blood sugar levels rise.

When the brain perceives sweetness, insulin is released.

Such a hypothesis has emerged, but it has not been properly accepted.

So to summarize...

Sugar substitutes do not directly raise blood sugar levels.

However, it can affect the gut microbiota and change its composition.

If the composition of gut microbiota changes, blood sugar levels can increase.

And if this happens, it causes problems with blood sugar control itself.

There is also the issue that one can easily become obese.

Simply put, it means that you become a body that easily gains weight.

Of course, that doesn't mean that regular cola is better than zero cola.

Regular cola contains too much sugar, and obviously, too much sugar is a problem.

So if you drink cola,

Drinking zero cola is a somewhat better choice than regular cola.

However, zero-calorie cola has no calories and does not raise blood sugar, so you can enjoy it freely.

You shouldn't think like this.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

Mice that received gut microbiota transplants from obese individuals became obese.

You mentioned that mice that received gut microbiota transplants from non-obese individuals did not become obese.

So, it means that obesity and dieting are determined by the state of the gut microbiota.

Does eating a lot of probiotics help with dieting?

Please tell me in detail about gut microbiota.

I recently made a detailed video explaining gut microbiota.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will set it up so that a video about gut microbiota appears in the upper left.

If you are curious about gut microorganisms, you can click here to see more.

I used to think that calories were the most important factor in dieting.

From the content of the video, it seems that blood sugar is quite important, right?

So, should I cut out carbohydrates for a good diet?

No, that's not it.

It's not that carbohydrates themselves are the problem.

The problem is that eating too many processed carbohydrates is an issue.

Why consuming a lot of processed carbohydrates is a problem.

What foods should I eat to diet?

I had explained this in detail as well.

I will make sure to display related videos in the upper right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
