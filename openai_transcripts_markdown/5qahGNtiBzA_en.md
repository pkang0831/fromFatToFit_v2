If you can't stick to a diet, just eating this can still help with weight loss.

Hello, this is pkang.

There are often questions in the comments about people who want to diet but are unable to do so.

This applies to office workers who need to buy lunch and students who have to eat school meals.

I know which foods are good for dieting and which are not by watching my videos, but...

They are people for whom it is difficult to change the food they eat due to circumstances.

In the case of such individuals, eating leafy greens along with their meals can be helpful.

In this video, I will talk about how leafy greens can be beneficial.

To understand the effects of leafy vegetables,

We need to understand why the common foods we eat are not good for dieting.

This content has already been repeated several times in other videos, so...

I will briefly touch on the key points.

For those who are curious about the details, you can click the link in the upper right corner to watch the related video.

The reason we become obese is that we eat too much food.

The reason we eat too much food is that we consume foods that increase our appetite.

People who are often obese tend to believe that they naturally have a strong appetite and

So I think I eat a lot of food, but

The truth is that there are various reasons why an increased appetite can be a problem.

In the past, I didn't think there was a problem with my appetite.

I used to think that simply eating less food was the best diet, but

Unless the issue of increased appetite is resolved, I will end up eating a lot again and gaining weight.

Recently, there has been growing interest in addressing this appetite issue.

It is often referred to as false hunger.

If we solve this issue of false hunger, the desire to eat a lot will disappear altogether.

In this case, the amount of food consumed will return to normal.

When the amount of food you eat returns to normal, your weight will also return to normal through dieting.

The main causes of increased appetite are refined foods and sodium.

Refined foods refer to those that are high in nutrient content and have been processed for quick digestion and absorption.

Processed foods have the characteristic of allowing a large amount of nutrients to be absorbed by the body in a short period of time.

When a large amount of nutrients is absorbed in a short period of time, the body releases a large amount of insulin.

Excessive insulin secretion increases body fat and enhances appetite.

In the case of sodium, it must always maintain a constant concentration in the body.

If you eat salty food, the sodium levels in your body will increase.

To adjust the concentration, the body water content increases.

The process of increasing body water also leads to an increase in appetite.

So, it's not necessary to eat low-calorie for dieting, but...

It is necessary to eat unprocessed, unrefined foods without adding salt.

The problem is that the common meals we eat mostly use refined foods and are heavily seasoned.

However, leafy vegetables can somewhat neutralize the issues of this general formula.

The characteristics of leafy vegetables are that they are large in volume and high in dietary fiber.

It has the effect of expelling sodium from the body.

The problem with processed foods is that many nutrients are absorbed quickly by the body.

However, the volume of leafy vegetables has the effect of reducing the amount of nutrients consumed.

Simply put, if you eat rice without leafy vegetables, you have to finish a whole bowl to feel full.

When you eat rice with leafy vegetables, the volume of the leafy vegetables makes you feel full even after eating just half a bowl.

If the amount of processed food consumed decreases, the amount of nutrients ingested also decreases.

If the dietary fiber in leafy vegetables interferes with digestion and absorption,

The digestion and absorption of the nutrients consumed also proceed slowly.

The issue of having too many nutrients can be resolved by reducing the amount consumed.

The issue of fast digestion and absorption is resolved by hindering digestion and absorption.

So when you eat refined foods, if you eat leafy vegetables along with them,

You can somewhat suppress the increased appetite caused by processed foods.

And the fact that it has the effect of expelling sodium from the body is

It is said that strong seasoning in food has the effect of reducing increased appetite.

In fact, this is more a characteristic of all vegetables rather than just leafy greens.

This has led to the saying that eating a lot of vegetables and greens is good for dieting.

So, is it best for dieting to eat only vegetables and not consume any other foods?

That's not the case.

The reason vegetables are said to be good for dieting is that they are low in calories and high in nutrients.

Reduce the amount of food you eat.

It slows down the digestion and absorption of the food consumed.

This is because it helps to eliminate the sodium consumed.

So, the advantage is that it minimizes the problems that arise from the food we eat together.

However, deciding to eat only vegetables without any other food means that you won't be able to take advantage of these benefits at all.

In the first place, there is no explanation of why vegetables are good for dieting.

Many people are aware that vegetables are good for dieting, so there are quite a few who eat them this way.

In this case, there are actually more disadvantages than advantages.

Vegetables have a large volume but are low in calories, so even if you eat a lot, they end up being low in calories.

A low-calorie diet can have a negative impact on dieting.

I will summarize.

To diet, it is necessary to address the issue of increased appetite.

The best way is to change the types of food you eat to unrefined foods.

However, there are people who, like students who have to eat school meals, have no choice but to eat processed foods.

People like this should eat leafy greens along with refined foods.

Utilize the volume of leafy greens to reduce the amount of processed food consumed.

By utilizing dietary fiber, slow down the digestion and absorption of refined foods consumed.

By utilizing the effect of leafy vegetables in expelling sodium, if the sodium consumed is eliminated from the body,

The issues with processed foods can be somewhat neutralized, which can help with dieting.

If you have no choice but to eat processed foods, it helps to eat leafy vegetables along with them.

Just eating leafy greens doesn't mean it's okay to consume a lot of processed foods.
