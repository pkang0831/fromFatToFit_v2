Hello, this is pkang.

This is a video responding to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

To explain the question,

In the past, between intermittent fasting and eating three meals a day,

I was asked the question of which is better.

So I made a response video.

The video link is displayed in the upper right corner.

If you're curious about the video content, you can click to watch it.

To summarize the conclusion of that video first,

Muscle mass and basal metabolic rate vary from person to person.

Even for the same person, the level of activity can vary from day to day.

Rather than strictly eating three meals a day, as in intermittent fasting,

It seems that it would be good to eat according to the body's signals.

However, if you eat food every time you are hungry,

Isn't becoming obese bad for your health?

It is not a problem to eat when you actually need food and feel hungry.

The problem is that the body doesn't need food, but there is a false sense of hunger.

If you eat according to this false hunger,

Obesity is not good for health.

The reason for experiencing false hunger is

It's due to fluctuations in blood sugar and issues with energy conversion.

The cause of these two problems is processed food.

This was covered in detail in another video.

A video link is displayed above, so if you're curious, you can click to watch it.

In other words, if you don't eat processed foods, you won't experience false hunger.

If there is no false hunger, I can trust the hunger signals from my body.

So when you eat when you're hungry, it doesn't lead to obesity or health problems.

In fact, for a person with a typical level of activity

If you eat unrefined foods,

Even if I only have 1 to 2 meals a day, I don't feel hungry.

That's why I usually have two meals a day.

On days with a lot of activity and exercise, I sometimes eat three meals.

On days when my activity and exercise levels are low, I sometimes eat just one meal.

Rather than consciously controlling it, it just happens that I eat when I'm hungry.

This was the content that appeared in that video.

After watching this video

Intermittent fasting or fasting has benefits beyond just burning body fat.

It seems that I focused too much on explaining only fat burning.

What do you think about the other benefits of intermittent fasting?

First, to briefly summarize intermittent fasting:

It is a method of eating that intentionally involves not eating for a certain period of time, known as short fasting.

The most famous method in Korea is the 16:8 intermittent fasting.

The 16 hours, including sleep time, is a fasting period during which no food is consumed.

You eat during the remaining 8 hours.

The simplest way to execute is

This is a method of not having breakfast and eating lunch at 1 PM and dinner between 7 and 8 PM.

The reason for doing this is

Ways to limit meal times

It is to avoid overeating, which is eating too much, or undereating, which is eating too little.

If you eat an appropriate amount of food without overeating or undereating, there are various benefits that can lead to better health.

This is a dietary method to achieve that effect.

So the important thing is not to overeat or undereat.

A 16-hour fast is a means to make it easier.

To make it easier to understand, let's take an example.

There is a method called "small bowl meal."

It's a way of eating where food is served in small bowls.

Because the bowl is small, it cannot hold a lot of food.

So it's a way of eating that helps prevent overeating.

The purpose of the small bowl eating method is to avoid overeating.

A small bowl is a means to make it easier.

There is some magic cast on the small bowl.

Putting food in this bowl doesn't make you healthy.

The goal is to avoid overeating.

To make it easier, you use a small bowl.

Intermittent fasting also aims to prevent overeating and undereating.

To make it easier, it's about doing a 16-hour fast.

As long as you stick to a 16-hour fasting period.

16 hours is not some kind of magic.

So, I stick to a 16-hour fasting period.

If you eat an enormous amount of food within 8 hours, you will not achieve the desired effect.

In fact, those who recommend intermittent fasting say that you shouldn't eat without restrictions during the 8-hour eating window.

You can eat processed foods, but you should limit your calories and not eat too much.

It says that you should eat unrefined foods without restricting calories.

Let's remember what we've discussed so far and take another look at the questions in the comments.

The advantages of intermittent fasting mentioned in the comments are threefold.

During the time of not having the first meal, the organs can rest.

The second body can regenerate itself.

The third hormone metabolism returns to normal.

It is true that by using intermittent fasting and avoiding overeating and undereating, you can achieve those three effects.

However, even without intermittent fasting, you can achieve the same effects if you avoid overeating and undereating.

Prevent overeating with unrefined foods, and avoid excessive eating by having meals when you are hungry.

It means that you can achieve the same effect.

If you actually reduce the intake of refined foods and follow a diet that includes unrefined foods,

Because the feeling of fullness lasts a long time, the amount of food consumed and the number of meals will decrease.

Because the amount of food and the number of meals decrease, the organs are able to take a rest.

The second aspect of the body’s self-regeneration seems to be related to autophagy.

There was a question in the comments about autophagy, so I created a response video.

The video link is available at the top right, so if you're curious, you can click to watch it.

To summarize the content of the video,

Autophagy is suppressed in both overeating, where one consumes a lot of food, and in undereating, where one consumes insufficient food.

It is activated only in situations where food is consumed appropriately.

If you use intermittent fasting and avoid overeating or undereating,

It is true that autophagy is activated and the body undergoes self-regeneration.

However, even if you use a different method instead of intermittent fasting,

If you do not overeat or undereat, autophagy will be activated.

The third hormone metabolism does not necessarily require you to adhere to a fasting period of 16 hours.

If you avoid overeating and undereating, your hormonal metabolism can return to normal.

So, there is no need to be overly fixated on a 16-hour fast.

Intermittent fasting was conducted with participants by setting specific amounts for meals, exercise, and activity levels.

Some participants exercise for 4 hours a day.

Some participants consume 5,000 calories a day.

Some participants only eat 800 calories a day.

If an experiment is conducted in such a situation, whatever effect arises...

Is that an effect caused by intermittent fasting?

Or is it an effect caused by exercise?

It becomes unclear whether the effects are due to the amount of food consumed.

So, we conduct experiments by standardizing all other conditions, which is called variable control.

Controlling this variable is absolutely necessary to conduct the experiment.

So, the 16-hour fasting is most effective under the conditions set in that experiment.

If I eat more than the conditions of the experiment, have less activity, and do not exercise,

Because the calorie intake is high but the calorie expenditure is low, it is effective to have a fasting period longer than 16 hours.

If I eat less than the conditions of that experiment, have a higher level of activity, and exercise, then...

Since the calorie intake is low but the calorie expenditure is high, it is more effective to have a fasting period shorter than 16 hours.

In addition to the 16:8 intermittent fasting, there is also the 5:2 intermittent fasting.

It's a method where you have three meals for five days a week and only one meal for two days.

This is also intermittent fasting and has the same effects, but it doesn't adhere to a daily 16-hour fast.

Again, it's not that there is magic in 16 hours; what's important is not overeating or undereating.

I will summarize.

Intermittent fasting is a dietary method that limits meal times to prevent overeating and undereating.

The health benefits arise not from restricting meal times, but from avoiding overeating and undereating.

Even if you use methods other than intermittent fasting,

You can achieve the same effect without overeating or undereating.

Sounds plausible, right?
