Is sugar absolutely forbidden when dieting? Not necessarily.

Hello, this is pkang.

Many people want to diet, but not many continue to do so.

This is because there are various factors that hinder dieting.

One of them is the taste of food.

It's too bland to keep eating diet food.

That's why it's difficult to continue dieting.

The factors that determine the taste of diet food are mainly two: salty and sweet.

In the video I made earlier, when eating diet food,

We talked about the reasons why you don't have to eat too blandly.

If you're curious about the content of the video in front, the video link is displayed in the top right corner.

You can click to see it.

In this video, I will talk about sweetness.

When eating diet food, you should not add seasonings that taste sweet, like sugar.

The reason many people have this kind of thought is

This is because refined carbohydrates, like sugar, are considered a cause of obesity.

Refined carbohydrates refer to processed carbohydrates that rapidly and significantly raise blood sugar levels.

Such carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels too quickly and significantly.

The body releases a large amount of insulin to lower blood sugar levels.

The large amount of insulin secreted creates false hunger, leading to increased food intake.

The food we eat at the same time is stored as body fat, making us increasingly obese.

Sugar made by squeezing, filtering, and boiling sugarcane.

Flour made by removing the husk of wheat and grinding it.

White rice made by peeling the skin off brown rice.

These three foods are representative of refined carbohydrate foods.

The three fattening white foods are also referred to as the "three hundred foods."

However, when you are really on a diet,

Should we absolutely avoid using sweet seasonings like sugar, oligosaccharide, and honey?

Foods that cause excessive insulin secretion due to blood sugar issues and lead to obesity require two conditions.

The first is that the increase in blood sugar levels will be high.

The second point is that the speed at which blood sugar rises will be fast.

At first glance, they may seem similar, but these two are different stories.

For example, when you dissolve sugar and candy in water to create sweet-tasting water,

If the amount added to the water is small, the water does not become very sweet.

No matter how quickly sugar dissolves in water, this fact itself does not change.

To make the water sweeter, you need to increase the amount of candy or sugar you add.

So how sweet does the water become?

Setting the maximum sweetness level is the quantity.

How quickly do you reach the maximum sweetness?

The speed that determines this is the rate at which it dissolves in water.

In the case where the same amount of candy and sugar is put into water for the same amount of time and then taken out,

Water with added sugar becomes sweeter.

Sugar melts faster than candy.

If we apply this to blood sugar levels,

The conditions under which refined carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels.

The amount of carbohydrates in the first meal is high, so the potential for blood sugar to rise will also be significant.

The second digestion and absorption are quick, so the blood sugar level is likely to rise rapidly.

There are two options like this.

In other words, if either of these two conditions is not met,

Blood sugar cannot rise too quickly, so it does not become food that makes you gain weight.

The amount of carbohydrates is high, which can lead to a significant increase in blood sugar levels.

If digestion and absorption are slow, it may not reach the maximum height due to the slow speed.

Digestion and absorption are quick, so the speed at which blood sugar rises is fast.

If the amount of carbohydrates is low, the maximum height that can be reached will also be lower.

For example, in the case of brown rice, it is a grain, so it contains a high amount of carbohydrates.

However, because it is whole grain, digestion and absorption are slow, which means that the rise in blood sugar levels is also slow.

Because of this, a person who used to eat white rice will experience a weight loss effect when they switch to brown rice.

In the case of fruits, they contain fructose, which is quickly digested and absorbed.

So the speed at which blood sugar rises is very fast.

Most fruits are made up of water, so they have a low carbohydrate content.

So the level of blood sugar that can rise is low.

Because of this, fruits are sweet but not fattening foods.

There is also a fruit diet that involves eating only fruits to lose weight, without consuming any other foods.

Returning to the story of sugar.

It is true that sugar quickly raises blood sugar levels, but...

If the amount of sugar consumed is small, the increase in blood sugar levels is low.

So it doesn't interfere with dieting. You can think of it as a concept similar to fruit.

So how much sugar can I consume?

Of course, it's best to eat as little as possible.

The lack of sweetness makes the diet tasteless, so I can't stick to it.

It would be best to add just enough so that you don't feel this way.

However, everyone's taste is different.

So I put in as little as possible, but what if that's still too much?

Of course, there is a possibility of that.

However, in this case, adjusting the quantity over time will resolve the issue.

In the case of taste, continuous exposure to strong stimuli can dull the senses, making it impossible to perceive weaker stimuli.

On the contrary, when strong stimuli disappear, one becomes more sensitive and can perceive weaker stimuli.

For example, a person who eats salty food becomes increasingly desensitized to the taste of salt.

Even when I eat salty food, I don't feel that it's salty.

People who follow a low-sodium diet and eat food with less salt become increasingly sensitive to salty flavors.

This applies not only to salty flavors but also to sweet flavors in the same way.

If you reduce the amount of sugar you consume, you will gradually become more sensitive to sweetness.

Later on, you will feel that even a small amount of sugar is sweet enough.

At this time, you can reduce the amount of sugar a bit more.

So, do I have to keep reducing sugar? I love sweetness too much to give it up...

Everyone has their own preferred tastes.

So, it is natural for someone to be unable to give up sweet foods.

However, it's not about giving up sweetness.

To avoid giving up sweetness, it is necessary to reduce sugar and make the taste buds more sensitive.

If a person who likes sweet foods often eats foods with a very strong sweetness, such as sweet bread or snacks,

Due to strong stimulation, the sense of taste becomes dull.

So even when you eat sweet foods, you won't feel the sweetness.

However, since I like sweet flavors and want to experience them, I end up looking for even sweeter foods.

This leads to a vicious cycle of increasingly seeking sweeter foods.

To break this vicious cycle, it is necessary to sharpen your sense of taste.

If you reduce the amount of sugar you consume, your sense of taste becomes increasingly sensitive.

In this way, you can feel that it is sweet enough with a small amount of sugar.

The ideal goal is to feel the sweetness when eating sautéed onions.

When I want something sweet, I usually eat fruit and feel satisfied.

In this case, when I eat it, I can taste the sweetness that I like because it sticks to my mouth.

Objectively, the amount of sugar or sweeteners consumed is small, so there is no issue with obesity.

And when you reach this level,

The sweet bread or snacks that I used to love have become so sweet that it's hard to eat them.

At this point, the desire for snacks or bread decreases, and you completely break free from the vicious cycle.

Isn't it more effective to completely stop eating sugar rather than gradually reducing it?

The less sugar you consume, the more sensitive your taste buds become.

In theory, that's how it is.

However, if someone who likes sweet flavors follows a diet without sweetness,

Because there is no sweetness, the diet is bland, making it difficult to stick to the diet for a long time.

If you can't stick to a diet for long, it's likely because your taste buds haven't become sensitive in the first place, leading to failure.

If you force yourself to refrain from eating something sweet and continue with your diet,

There is an increasing problem with the desire to eat sweet foods.

When the craving for sweetness becomes strong, even overly sweet flavors can taste good.

There is a saying that the market is like a side dish.

It's a food that I usually find unappetizing and don't even glance at.

It means that when you go a long time without eating, even that becomes very delicious.

If your diet has a slight sweetness, and therefore you are not experiencing a strong craving for sweet foods, then...

When your sense of taste becomes more sensitive, you may start to dislike bread or snacks because they taste too sweet.

However, if there is no sweetness in the diet at all and the craving for sweet foods is very strong,

Rather than feeling that overly sweet bread or snacks are just too sweet, I strongly feel that they are delicious.

If you eat a lot of bread or snacks because they taste good, your sense of taste can become dull again and return to its original state.

Of course, it's better for someone who can quit all at once to do so, but...

If someone is unable to do that, gradually reducing it is more effective.

I will summarize.

The fact that foods that quickly raise blood sugar levels interfere with dieting.

There is a perception that you should never consume sugar when eating diet food.

If the amount of sugar added is small, it won't significantly raise blood sugar levels.

If your diet lacks sweetness and tastes bland, making it difficult to stick to it for a long time,

You can add a little sugar.

I dislike and find it difficult to stick to a tasteless diet, so rather than giving up on dieting and eating processed foods,

Adding a little sugar to a diet plan is obviously better for dieting.
