The reason my friend, who eats snacks every day, is slim.

A question was raised about why a friend who eats snacks every day does not gain weight.

I work at the same company as my friend, and we both like snacks.

While working and eating snacks, the questioner is gradually gaining weight.

My friend keeps saying that I'm slim.

Since we buy snacks together at the convenience store, the types of snacks we eat are similar.

When I see my friend, they are always eating snacks, so it doesn't seem like they eat a small amount.

But why does the friend not gain weight while the person sharing the story does?

It is because there is a difference in the way of eating.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

The reason people say that eating snacks makes you gain weight is because

It's partly because the calories in the snacks themselves are high.

Foods like snacks can lead to overeating.

Snacks often have a shelf life of more than six months.

There are various methods for long-term storage to prevent food from spoiling.

The main method used in snacks is drying.

The more you dry food and remove moisture, the less likely it is to spoil.

The problem is that removing moisture increases the nutrient density.

When the nutrient density increases, the amount of nutrients entering the body per hour also increases.

Let's take an example to make it easier to understand.

Bananas are made up of 80% water.

When you dry 1kg of bananas to remove the moisture, it becomes 200g of banana chips.

Although the moisture has been removed, the nutrients remain intact.

200g of banana chips contains the nutrients equivalent to 1kg of bananas.

The nutritional density has increased fivefold.

However, the eating time does not increase fivefold.

The time it takes to eat 200g of banana chips is similar to the time it takes to eat 200g of bananas.

You can now consume five times the nutrients in the same amount of time.

This becomes a problem.

When nutrients enter the body, a hormone called insulin is released.

Insulin lowers blood sugar levels that have risen due to carbohydrates.

Help proteins to be used for muscle synthesis.

It stores fat as body fat.

As you start eating, the nutrients entering your body gradually increase.

When you finish eating, the nutrients that enter your body gradually decrease.

According to this process, insulin gradually increases and then gradually decreases.

However, processed foods that have a high nutritional density are

A lot of nutrients enter the body in a short amount of time, and this is where problems arise.

To handle a sudden influx of nutrients, insulin needs to be released quickly and in large amounts.

Since I rushed out, I ended up bringing more than I needed.

If insulin, which lowers blood sugar and stores body fat, is produced in excess of the necessary amount,

Blood sugar levels drop too low, and body fat increases too much.

Our bodies try to maintain a stable blood sugar level.

When blood sugar drops too low, one feels the need for food to raise the blood sugar again.

Some of the energy obtained from food needs to be used right now.

If too much is stored as body fat, there will be a lack of energy available for immediate use.

I feel that I need food to replenish my lacking energy.

When the body feels the need for food, a desire to eat more arises.

Because of this, I have eaten enough food, so my stomach is full, but...

It becomes a strange state where you want to eat more food.

This is called false hunger.

If you eat according to this false hunger, it leads to overeating.

If overeating is repeated, you will gradually gain weight.

If too much is stored as body fat, then energy becomes insufficient.

I should use the stored body fat. Why do you want to eat more?

If there is too much insulin, the stored body fat cannot be used.

Insulin is a hormone that stores body fat.

In situations where there is a lot of insulin, the burning of body fat is suppressed.

There is a lot of body fat stored in the body, but

Since you can't use that, you're trying to get energy from food.

The same goes for blood sugar levels.

The glucose that was raising your blood sugar hasn't disappeared; it's stored in your body.

Insulin is a hormone that lowers blood sugar by storing glucose.

In situations with high insulin levels, stored glucose cannot be released.

So, you're trying to raise your blood sugar by eating sweet foods.

Our bodies are not designed to take in a large amount of nutrients in a short period of time.

It is not prepared.

There are very few foods that can be obtained from nature.

It is a new food created through the advancement of technology and food processing.

The side effect of this new food is that symptoms of obesity are occurring.

Now that we know the cause of the problem, let's try to find a solution.

Snacks are designed to remove as much moisture as possible for long-term preservation.

It was said that removing moisture increases nutrient density.

If you eat these snacks every day but don't gain weight, you are likely to eat them slowly and in small amounts.

A typical person breaks a snack that can be eaten in one bite into two or three pieces before eating it.

Chew slowly and swallow.

It's not about eating the next snack immediately, but rather eating it after a certain amount of time has passed.

I eat slowly little by little, so it takes a very long time to finish.

Since I've been eating for a long time, I find myself eating snacks every time I see them.

So it seems like I'm eating a lot of snacks, but...

The actual amount I eat is not that much.

Even if you eat snacks, if you eat them this way, you won't experience false hunger.

The calories from snacks can create a feeling of fullness.

Feeling full while eating snacks, so leaving some uneaten.

If I eat snacks and feel full, I won't gain weight if I don't have a meal, right?

On the contrary, a person who eats snacks quickly...

It's hard to see someone eating snacks because they quickly eat and clean up.

So it seems like I'm not eating snacks, but in reality, I'm eating a lot.

Eating snacks that are high in nutritional density quickly leads to a false sense of hunger.

Because of this false hunger, I eat more snacks or

While eating snacks and then having meals, I gradually gain weight.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

Snacks are dehydrated for long-term storage.

In this process, the nutritional density increases.

Second

Processed foods that have a high nutritional density are

It allows a lot of nutrients to enter the body in a short amount of time.

To process a lot of nutrients in a short amount of time, insulin needs to be released quickly and in large amounts.

When insulin is released rapidly and in large amounts, it can create a false sense of hunger.

Third

Because overeating due to false hunger leads to gradually gaining weight.

To avoid gaining weight or to diet,

It is important to prevent false hunger from occurring.

To achieve that, it is advisable to avoid eating snacks that are high in nutritional density as much as possible.

If you have to eat, it's better to eat slowly and in small amounts.

I can organize it like this.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

I watched the video well.

It's easy to say to eat snacks slowly and in small amounts, but is it really possible?

It seems like it will be tough because of the anticipation.

People who like and often eat snacks may find it difficult.

However, if you change the types of food you eat to normalize your body's hormonal metabolism,

I naturally end up eating slowly, little by little.

There was a similar question in the past, so I made a detailed explanation video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

They say that snacks high in sugar are really the ones that make you gain weight.

Is it okay to eat snacks that are low in sugar?

Because sugars quickly raise blood sugar levels.

It is true that snacks high in sugar are problematic.

However, just having low sugar content doesn't mean it's okay.

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the upper right corner.

I love snacks, chocolate, and cake so much that I would rather skip meals and eat treats instead.

What should someone like me do to diet?

Most of the desires we feel are determined by the state of our body.

In reality, when you follow a diet that restricts carbohydrates, your cravings for carbohydrates increase.

Even someone who disliked potatoes and sweet potatoes finds them delicious.

Even if I skip meals, I want to eat snacks. This desire is also influenced by my body.

I received the same story before and explained it in detail through a video.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.
