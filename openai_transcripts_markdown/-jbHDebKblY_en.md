A person who loves snacks, chocolate, and cake, making it difficult to diet.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

A flight crew member has requested assistance.

I used to follow a diet where I hardly ate, and I reached a weight of 40 kg at a height of 165 cm.

At that time, I was thinking about food all day long and also had an obsession with it.

They say this period was the most sensitive and the most unhappy time.

Since then, I have been eating snacks, chocolate, and ice cream like they were staples.

It is said that they would skip meals just to eat snacks, chocolate, and ice cream.

As a result, I gained nearly 20 kg.

I thought my current life was a problem, so I tried to eat.

Even after eating a meal, I always make sure to have dessert, and I've heard that I eat more dessert than the meal itself.

People around me say that I eat like that, so they wonder why I'm not losing weight.

I saw that you usually had meals with sweet potatoes and chicken breast.

The statement about having eaten rice that was mentioned earlier does not mean that I actually ate rice.

I had a meal with sweet potatoes and chicken breast, but it seems you expressed that as having rice.

So in front of others, I eat sweet potatoes and chicken breast.

I ate snacks or cake when others weren't watching.

Since it looks like I'm eating sweet potatoes and chicken breast to others,

I asked why you aren't losing weight if you're eating like that.

Because of this, it was uncomfortable to eat with others.

They said that eating snacks alone felt comfortable.

Still, I have to go on a diet, so I have reduced the amount of snacks I eat.

I reduced my intake much more than when I ate snacks as a staple, but I didn't lose any weight.

They said they are feeling very upset because they are gaining weight even though they are eating little by little.

Due to the nature of being an airline crew member, there are really many thin people around.

So recently, I was the most unhappy.

They say you might have thought that being 165 cm tall and weighing 40 kg was better.

In that situation, I watched my video and tried eating unrefined foods.

After eating unprocessed foods, I really started to crave chocolate and snacks less.

Reduce the chocolate and snacks I used to eat every day to once every two days.

They said they didn't eat at all last week.

But when I went to the hospital,

I was told that since the stomach and intestines are quite damaged, I should eat soft foods that are easy to digest.

However, that kind of food is the complete opposite of the food shown in my video.

I feel overwhelmed and don't know what to do. Please help me.

First of all, the reason I brought this story is that

It's a very typical pattern for women to struggle and fail with dieting.

So, what problems are there here?

And if I talk about how to solve that problem,

I brought this story because I think it will be helpful to many people.

The beginning of all problems starts from that point when I lost weight by starving myself.

It is often said that following a low-calorie diet or starving oneself to lose weight lowers the basal metabolic rate.

When talking about basal metabolic rate in relation to dieting,

If you lose weight by starving yourself, your muscle mass decreases, which lowers your basal metabolic rate.

Increasing muscle mass through exercise raises the basal metabolic rate.

Because we talk a lot like this,

Some people think that the basal metabolic rate is the energy consumed by muscles.

The energy consumed by muscles accounts for only 18% of the basal metabolic rate.

The remaining 82% is the energy consumed in the long term.

In fact, 19% of the basal metabolic rate is consumed by the brain.

The heart uses 7%, the liver uses 27%, and the kidneys use 10%. The remaining organs consume 19%.

So, saying that the basal metabolic rate decreases also means that muscle mass is decreasing.

This also means that the functions of major organs like the brain, heart, and liver are declining.

And this major organ also includes the digestive system.

So, when the basal metabolic rate decreases, it means that the function of the digestive system also declines.

This makes it difficult to digest food.

It's hard to digest food.

You start looking for foods that provide a lot of energy even with just a little bit and are easy to digest.

The foods that meet those conditions are snacks, chocolate, and ice cream.

The human body moves because it receives electrical signals from the brain.

It is possible to stimulate a specific part of the brain to raise an arm.

There is an interesting experiment that utilizes this.

After stimulating the participant's brain to raise their arm,

Hiding the fact that stimulation was given to the brain.

"When you ask, 'Why did you raise your arm?'"

Most participants responded that they just wanted to raise their arms.

The reason for raising the arm is that it stimulates the brain.

Without knowing this fact, one thinks that they wanted it.

Let's apply this experiment to the flight attendant mentioned in the story.

With a starvation diet, the basal metabolic rate has decreased, and the function of the digestive system has diminished.

So, when you eat foods that are difficult to digest and absorb, it puts a greater burden on the digestive system.

What happens when the brain sends a signal to eat snacks that are easy to digest and absorb?

It means that I rationalize myself because I like and want snacks.

So you end up liking snacks more than rice, and you start eating snacks like a staple food.

In reality, many women are doing starvation diets and low-calorie diets.

Because of that, the digestive system weakens, leading to a preference for snacks or cake.

I didn't know this, but I originally liked snacks and cake, so I say that dieting is hard.

This is really unfortunate.

In this situation, please watch my video.

I ate plenty without restricting calories.

You mentioned that your desire for snacks has decreased, and as a result, you actually ate fewer snacks.

So it wasn't that I originally liked snacks, but rather it happened because of my physical condition.

This means that if you diet in the right way, you can reduce your cravings for snacks.

However, after that, I visited the hospital and...

Since your digestive system is quite weak, they recommend eating soft foods.

You are asking how to handle this soft food since it is the opposite of unrefined food, right?

As mentioned earlier, it is true that the digestive system has weakened.

It is also true that I need to eat soft foods because of that.

Then how should we eat food?

You can make the unrefined food that appeared in my video easier to digest and absorb by preparing it in a soft manner before eating.

You just need to boil, mash, grind, and mill it to eat.

Eating this way makes digestion and absorption easier, so the weight loss effect may decrease.

It can restore the digestive system.

Because unrefined foods are rich in various vitamins and minerals.

So, foods like snacks and cakes are easy to digest, which puts less strain on the digestive system.

Because it has calories, you can secure the energy you need right away, but...

There are no vitamins or minerals that can restore the body.

So, I can't restore the digestive system.

Since the digestive system is not recovering, there is an issue of having to keep eating snacks and cakes.

If you boil, chop, grind, and mash unrefined foods and eat them,

It can provide the necessary energy while putting less strain on the digestive system.

It means that by supplying various vitamins and minerals at the same time, the body can be restored.

In fact, it was a diet that briefly became popular in the past.

There is something called the witch soup diet and a detox diet.

The witch's soup diet involves making a soup by simmering healthy vegetables and meat for a long time.

The detox diet involves blending healthy vegetables and fruits to drink as juice.

In a situation where the digestive system is weakened, food prepared that way is not burdensome.

If you provide your body with energy using food made like that,

You will no longer need to eat snacks or cake.

So the desire for snacks and cake decreases.

As various vitamins and minerals are supplied to the body, it recovers and the condition improves.

If you eat witch soup or drink detox juice because of this,

It was a trend for a while that losing weight comes with becoming healthier.

The problem is that I didn't know the exact reason why that happens.

After recovering the body

Many people have been resorting to starvation diets or low-calorie meal plans again.

So the same problem keeps repeating.

There are claims that the effects of witch's brew and detox juice are temporary.

The number of people doing it has decreased a lot now.

So to summarize,

People who have lowered their basal metabolic rate by following a starvation diet or a low-calorie diet.

As the basal metabolic rate decreases, the digestive system also weakens.

There is a desire for foods that are easy to digest and high in calories, such as snacks, chocolate, and cake.

This makes it difficult to stick to a diet.

To solve this problem, it is necessary to first restore the digestive system.

If you cook, grind, chop, and crush unrefined foods to make them easier to digest and absorb, then you can eat them.

The desire for snacks, chocolate, and cake decreases, and the digestive system begins to recover.

After that, don't go back to starving diets or low-calorie meal plans.

It means that you can lose weight healthily by eating unprocessed foods.

So, what is unrefined food?

In a moment, two videos will appear on the screen.

I will set up a video on the left that talks about unrefined foods.

I struggled a lot with low-calorie diets, so I don't want to do low-calorie diets anymore in the future.

Is there a way to check if the diet I'm currently following is a low-calorie diet?

There is a way to check.

Is the diet I'm currently doing on the right not a low-calorie diet?

I will make sure to have a video on how to check it.

You can choose and watch the video you need from the two videos.
