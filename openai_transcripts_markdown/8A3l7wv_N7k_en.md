How many calories should I eat to lose weight without experiencing a yo-yo effect?

Hello, this is pkang.

Eating too much food can lead to obesity.

To diet, you should not eat a lot.

It's a very obvious statement in dieting.

However, if you eat too little, your metabolism slows down, which can lead to a rebound effect.

There is a saying that eating too little food is not good for dieting.

So, how much food should I actually eat?

Recently, there have been too many questions of this kind appearing in the comments.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

First of all, it is quite obvious that the amount of food needed varies from person to person.

Each person has different amounts of body fat and muscle mass.

The amount of activity and exercise is different, so the amount of energy consumed is also different.

It's because the amount absorbed by the body varies when food is eaten.

In calorie diet theory,

If you eat food that contains 500 kcal, it is assumed that 500 kcal has been absorbed by the body.

In fact, a person is not able to absorb 100% of the calories from the food they eat.

Only a certain percentage is absorbed.

This absorption rate varies from person to person and can also change for the same person depending on the situation.

I understand that it's difficult to calculate the energy obtained from food because everyone's absorption rate is different.

Isn't it possible to calculate the energy that the body consumes?

You can calculate your basal metabolic rate, and the calories burned through exercise are all available on the internet.

The calculation of basal metabolic rate and calories burned through exercise should be considered as average values.

Basal metabolic rate calculation is mainly based on age, height, and weight.

Even if two people have the same age, height, and weight, their body fat and muscle mass can be different.

Even if the amount of body fat and muscle is similar, the functions of the major organs are different.

The calories burned through exercise do not remain the same even if you perform the same exercise.

For example, when moving an object weighing 50 kg, the amount of energy required and

When comparing the amount of energy required to move a 100 kg object,

Of course, it would require more energy to move a 100kg object.

Similarly, when doing the same exercise,

A person weighing 50 kg and a person weighing 100 kg will have a difference in the energy they consume.

In that case, can we calculate for people with the same weight?

That's not the case.

Even if the objects have the same weight, the energy required varies depending on the speed at which they are moving.

The faster the movement speed, the more energy is required.

So even if two people with the same weight do the same exercise,

The amount of energy consumed varies depending on the speed at which you perform the exercise.

If the same exercise is performed, the weight is the same, and the speed of the exercise is also identical, is it possible to calculate?

This also doesn't work. There is a difference in energy efficiency.

In reality, if you consistently continue the same exercise, it becomes easier over time.

This is because the nerves and muscles necessary for exercise develop, leading to increased efficiency over time.

When exercising, it's better to do more than just one type of exercise.

The reason why it's said that mixing things up is good is because of this.

I can't accurately calculate how much energy I consume in a day.

I am in a situation where I cannot know exactly how many calories from the food I eat are absorbed by my body.

In this situation, calculating how many calories of food will cause weight gain or loss is

It is practically impossible.

So what should I do?

It's impossible to calculate, so you don't have to calculate it.

In the first place, it is not necessary to calculate in order to know the amount of food your body needs.

All living beings, including humans, have a mechanism that informs them of the amount of food they need.

When you need food, a hunger for food arises, and when you eat enough food, a feeling of fullness occurs.

So there is a mechanism called appetite that tells me the amount of food my body needs.

The reason we become obese is that this appetite mechanism malfunctions.

In the video [How to Distinguish Between Foods That Make You Gain Weight and Foods That Help You Lose Weight], I talked about it in detail.

When consuming processed refined foods, a large amount of nutrients is absorbed by the body in a short period of time.

The body releases a large amount of insulin to process this nutrient.

When insulin is secreted in large amounts, it leads to false hunger.

False hunger refers to a desire to eat even when there is no actual need for food.

If you eat food based on this false hunger, you end up eating too much and becoming obese.

On the contrary, eating unprocessed, raw foods eliminates false hunger.

When false hunger disappears and appetite returns to normal,

I will naturally come to know the amount of food my body needs.

When you need food, you feel hungry, and when you eat enough food, you feel full.

For people who are obese, it is possible to lose weight by eating only the amount of food they need.

If you eat as much food as you need, you won't lack energy.

There's no need to use body fat, so how does dieting work?

I talked in detail about the principles of a diet that doesn't make you hungry in the video.

A person with a high amount of body fat who is obese has a response in their body that attempts to reduce body fat on its own.

So if you eliminate false hunger and eat according to normal appetite,

Body fat will gradually decrease on its own.

If you would like more detailed information about this part,

The video link is available in the top right corner, so you can click on it to watch.

After following the diet that Ronka recommended, my false hunger has disappeared and my appetite has significantly decreased.

I was told to eat when I'm hungry and not to eat when I'm full, so I'm following that advice.

As I continued to eat like that, the amount of food I consume in a day became very small.

Is it okay to keep eating like this?

Recently, there have been quite a few questions of this kind appearing in the comments.

I recently created a series of videos about basal metabolic rate.

After watching that video, you might be worried that your basal metabolic rate will decrease.

First of all, if you have obesity with a lot of visceral fat, it is okay to continue eating like that.

As mentioned earlier, a body with a high amount of body fat has a response to reduce body fat on its own.

When the body reduces body fat on its own, energy is generated from that.

Because there is energy generated from body fat, it means that less food is needed.

However, the situation is a bit different for those who are close to a normal weight or have subcutaneous fat obesity.

This is something that was discussed in the video "[The Reasons Why Men's and Women's Diets Are Different]."

Visceral fat is the fat that is located right next to the organs, so it is a type of fat that can be easily used for energy, but

Subcutaneous fat is the fat located just beneath the skin, so it is fat that is far from the internal organs.

It is fat that is difficult to utilize for energy.

So, in the case of someone who has a normal weight or is classified as having subcutaneous fat obesity, and therefore has little visceral fat,

There isn't much body fat available to use as energy.

So the body's response to reduce body fat on its own is not very strong.

In that case, there wouldn't be much energy generated while the body is reducing body fat on its own.

Why might I not want to eat more food?

It's because my body doesn't require much energy.

So that means the amount of speech has already decreased.

It's not the time to worry about my metabolism decreasing because I'm eating less, even though my metabolism is currently normal.

Since the amount of speech has already decreased,

The problem is that the amount of food I want to eat is small when my appetite is normal.

The low metabolic rate is the problem.

By increasing your activity level and exercising, you can raise your metabolism and solve the problem.

If you increase your metabolism, doesn't that make your appetite stronger and lead to weight gain? Can't you just keep eating less?

If it's not a false hunger or an unusual appetite, it's okay for your appetite to be strong.

Eating the food that your body needs doesn't lead to weight gain.

Continuing to neglect a state of low metabolic rate is not a good choice.

High-performance electronic devices tend to result in higher electricity bills.

A healthy and strong body consumes a lot of energy, and naturally has a high metabolic rate.

On the contrary, having a low metabolic rate means having a weak body that is not in good health.

Because my health is not good, it is not advisable to neglect it from a health perspective.

From a dieting perspective, it is not good to neglect it.

A healthy and strong body that consumes a lot of energy can occasionally eat processed foods without any issues, but

When you have poor health and a weak body, problems arise every time you eat processed food.

And as mentioned in the fourth video about basal metabolic rate,

If a low metabolic rate continues, it can lead to skinny fat.

Lean obesity is a type of subcutaneous fat obesity, which causes the body to become flabby and saggy.

From a beauty perspective, it is not good to continuously neglect a state of low metabolism.

I will summarize.

The most important thing in dieting is to normalize your appetite.

If your appetite has returned to normal, you should eat when you are hungry and not eat when you are full.

However, eating like that makes me eat too little food.

In that case, having a very low metabolic rate could be the cause.

If the metabolic rate remains low for an extended period, it is not good for health, dieting, or beauty.

It is advisable to increase your activity level and exercise to boost your metabolism.

If you are already exercising, the cause may be that the intensity of your workouts is too low.

You can try increasing the intensity of your workout a bit more.

If you want to increase the intensity of your workouts but feel weak and lack motivation,

There may be a problem with the diet.

Simply put, the best approach to dieting is to combine a proper diet with exercise.

If you are not exercising, you need to start exercising.

If you don't have the energy to exercise, it means there is an issue with your diet.

It means that the diet needs to be adjusted so that one can exercise.
