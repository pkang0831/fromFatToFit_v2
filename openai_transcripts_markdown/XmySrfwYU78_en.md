Hello, this is pkang.

This is the fourth video about the stagnation phase, as a question about it was posted in the comments.

There is a link to the traffic jam video playlist in the upper right corner.

If you want to watch the video in front, you can click to see it.

Since the content of the video is connected, it is advisable to watch it if possible.

In Part 1 of the video, we discussed how to distinguish between fake identity and true identity.

In Part 2 of the video, we will discuss homeostasis and yo-yo effects.

We looked into the causes of plateaus in a low-calorie diet and how to resolve them.

In part 3 of the video, we explored the causes of plateaus in a ketogenic diet and how to resolve them.

In this video, I will try to answer the question that was mentioned at the end of part 3.

First, let's watch the question video.

The reason for hitting a plateau on a ketogenic diet is said to be due to protein.

Because protein stimulates a lot of insulin secretion, eating a lot of protein can lead to weight gain and a plateau.

You should limit your protein intake.

I also experienced a plateau while doing keto, but I reduced my protein intake and lost more weight.

If what Mr. pkang is saying is true,

If there is a protein deficiency, shouldn't the absorption rate increase and a plateau occur?

Why does weight decrease even when protein intake is restricted?

First of all, protein stimulates a significant release of insulin.

This is true when protein is consumed alone.

If you consume protein alone without other nutrients, the secretion of insulin is actually quite high.

However, this is only the case when protein is consumed alone.

When protein and fat are consumed together, the fat slows down the insulin response.

Insulin is secreted in small amounts.

There is a case where an experiment was conducted using eggs.

When you remove the yolk from the egg and eat only the egg white.

So, you only ate protein. At that time, the amount of insulin secretion was high.

When you eat the yolk and the egg white together.

There are experiments that show that when fats and proteins are consumed together, the amount of insulin secretion decreases.

The ketogenic diet actively encourages the intake of healthy fats.

I intentionally add fat to my food.

The most representative example is bulletproof coffee, which is made by adding butter to coffee.

In a ketogenic diet, there are practically no cases where protein is consumed separately without fat.

So, I wouldn't know about other diets, but...

In a ketogenic diet, consuming a lot of protein increases insulin secretion.

It is not correct to say that this will lead to a stagnation period.

So, restricting protein as a way to break through a ketogenic plateau is not the correct approach.

However, after restricting protein, my weight loss plateau has broken and I've lost weight. Why is this happening?

First of all, as mentioned in the third part of the video,

If you consume any nutrient among carbohydrates, fats, or proteins in insufficient amounts, the absorption rate will increase.

It is true that if you consume protein in insufficient amounts, the absorption rate increases.

However, in the case of protein, it is possible for the absorption rate to increase while still losing weight.

Because protein is the building material for muscles.

If protein intake is restricted, muscle loss will occur.

Even if the absorption rate increases and body fat doesn't decrease, if muscle mass decreases due to muscle loss,

This is because body weight decreases by the amount of weight lost from muscle.

Furthermore, the ketogenic diet severely restricts carbohydrate intake.

I cannot exercise because the glycogen needed for the workout has not been replenished.

If you restrict protein intake without exercising, muscle loss will naturally occur.

So, while my weight is decreasing, it's not body fat that's reducing, but rather muscle.

This is not a diet.

Since body fat is not decreasing, from the perspective of body fat, it can still be considered a plateau phase.

I am following a low-carb diet, but I am not on a ketogenic diet.

I also have a plateau, is this caused by a lack of carbohydrates?

Yes, that can happen.

Carbohydrates are not extremely lacking to the point of reaching a state of ketosis.

There are cases where carbohydrates are insufficient.

In summary, if there is a deficiency in any of the nutrients among carbohydrates, fats, and proteins,

To fill in the lacking nutrients, the absorption rate increases.

Due to this increased absorption rate, a stagnation period occurs when balance is achieved.

The way to resolve this stagnation is to consume the lacking nutrients to lower the absorption rate.

When talking about plateaus, we often discuss cheat days as a solution.

Just have a cheat day, and after the cheat day, do a fast. This is often shared in this way.

On cheat day, I eat a lot of food to supplement the lacking nutrients.

This is the principle of lowering the absorption rate to break out of a stagnation period.

In other words,

If you structure your diet to ensure that nutrients are not lacking from the beginning, there will be no plateau.

There is no plateau, so there is no need to rely on cheat days.

How do you create a diet without plateaus?

In the next video, we will talk about a diet without plateaus.

There should be videos playing on both sides of the screen right now.

Once the next part 5 video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the fifth part of the traffic jam series, it means that the video is still being made.

Thank you for your patience for a few days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
