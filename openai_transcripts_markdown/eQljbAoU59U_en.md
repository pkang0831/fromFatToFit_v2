I heard that even if carbohydrates turn into body fat, the amount is not significant. Is that true?

All videos have subtitles.

Is it correct that you need to reduce carbohydrates to diet?

I would like to discuss this question that has come up.

First, let's read the content of the question.

When you eat carbohydrates, your blood sugar rises.

When blood sugar rises, insulin is released.

Insulin stores carbohydrates as body fat, which leads to obesity.

There is a lot of talk about needing to reduce carbohydrates in order to diet.

I saw a comment saying that it is not true.

Even though carbohydrates raise blood sugar, not all of it becomes body fat.

1g of carbohydrates is 4 kcal, and 1g of fat is 9 kcal.

This is why there is a difference in calories.

Even if carbohydrates are stored as body fat, the amount is not significant.

I heard that you don't necessarily need to reduce carbohydrates when you're on a diet.

If you look at the diets of bodybuilders, they have been following low-fat diets both in the past and now.

If reducing carbohydrates is indeed the way to lose weight, then...

They were asking why bodybuilders follow low-fat diets instead of low-carbohydrate diets.

I think it makes sense after hearing it. What do you think?

This is a question about such content. Let's discuss it in detail.

First of all, the story that the question is based on is mostly correct.

Some of the carbohydrates that raise blood sugar are stored as glycogen, which is the energy source for muscles.

Not all carbohydrates turn into body fat.

Carbohydrates and fats have different calorie contents.

It is true that the amount stored as fat when carbohydrates are converted is not large.

It's true that bodybuilders prefer low-fat diets over low-carbohydrate diets.

So, when dieting, is it not necessary to reduce carbohydrates?

That's not the case.

To diet, you need to reduce carbohydrates that quickly and significantly raise blood sugar levels.

The question only mentions carbohydrates and insulin.

Insulin is a hormone that also affects proteins and fats.

It also helps proteins to be used for muscle synthesis.

The fat we consume can also be stored as body fat.

Unlike carbohydrates, fat is not stored as glycogen, and there is no difference in calories.

If you consume carbohydrates that quickly and significantly raise your blood sugar, it will lead to a large release of insulin.

That much insulin stores a lot of fat as body fat.

This is the problem.

So, isn't it that fat is the problem, not carbohydrates?

Here, people's thoughts can differ.

Even if you eat a lot of carbohydrates and produce a lot of insulin,

If you hadn't eaten the fat that would be stored as body fat,

Body fat is not likely to increase significantly.

If you think this way, fat seems to be the problem.

Even if you eat fat,

If there had been no insulin to store that fat in the body.

Body fat is unlikely to have increased.

If you think about it this way, carbohydrates that trigger insulin seem to be the problem.

So, some people see carbohydrates as the cause of obesity, while others see fats as the cause.

The problem is that this is misunderstood.

The less carbohydrates you eat, the better it is for dieting.

Many people misunderstand that eating less fat is better for dieting.

Some of the carbohydrates we consume are stored as glycogen.

Glycogen is used as energy in the muscles.

If you restrict carbohydrates too severely, glycogen will become insufficient, and

When glycogen is depleted, muscles find it difficult to exert strength.

If the muscles cannot exert strength, the body will not move well.

In fact, a typical symptom of carbohydrate deficiency is lethargy.

If a state of lethargy, where activity and exercise levels are reduced, is maintained for a long time,

Muscle mass decreases and basal metabolic rate drops.

The same goes for 지방.

The calories in fat are more than double those in carbohydrates and protein.

So a significant amount of the calories consumed from food comes from fat.

In such a situation, if you limit your intake of fat,

The calorie intake will significantly decrease.

Then you will be in a calorie deficit.

If this condition persists for a long time, the body's basal metabolic rate decreases.

The human body needs carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

Whether it's carbohydrates or fats, severely restricting them can lead to problems.

The issue is not with carbohydrates and fats themselves, but rather with consuming them in excess.

So, I eat carbohydrates, fats, and proteins all together.

You need to reduce the amount you eat rather than what made you gain weight.

This is the most basic principle of dieting.

The carbohydrates consumed by people who are obese are those that rapidly and significantly raise blood sugar levels.

For example, sugary drinks like cola and cider, or processed foods like snacks.

Foods like that contain a lot of carbohydrates.

If you reduce such foods and eat things like potatoes, sweet potatoes, and brown rice,

The amount of carbohydrates entering the body decreases.

To diet, it is said that you need to reduce carbohydrates.

It's not that you shouldn't eat carbohydrates.

It means to change the types of food you eat to reduce the amount of carbohydrates that enter your body.

This is the most fundamental aspect of dieting.

It is also applicable to the bodybuilder's low-fat diet.

In the first place, bodybuilders don't consume sugary drinks or processed foods in their diet.

It is because eating too much leads to obesity.

It is only natural to reduce it to a reasonable level.

In that state, by further restricting fat, it becomes a low-fat diet.

While maintaining a carbohydrate intake that is sufficient to lead to obesity

Just because the fat has been reduced, it doesn't mean it's a low-fat diet.

Because eating too much leads to obesity.

I understand that it's natural to reduce a certain amount when trying to lose weight.

The bodybuilder's low-fat diet means that they have further reduced fat from that state, right?

If you look at a bodybuilder's diet, they hardly eat any fat.

You mentioned that not eating enough fat can also be a problem.

So why do bodybuilders follow a low-fat diet?

It's because of the muscles.

Insulin helps lower blood sugar by storing carbohydrates as glycogen and body fat, but it also does other things.

Help proteins to be used for muscle synthesis.

I mentioned that the fat we consume is also stored as body fat.

The bodybuilder's goal is to increase muscle mass, even if just a little.

So I try to make the most of insulin, which helps with muscle synthesis.

If we compare how much carbohydrates, fats, and proteins stimulate insulin,

Carbohydrates cause the most insulin to be released.

Next is protein.

Fat actually causes less insulin to be released.

There was an experiment conducted with eggs.

The egg white is mostly protein, while the yolk is fat.

When comparing eating only the egg white to eating both the egg white and the yolk together,

The amount of insulin secreted when only eating egg whites is higher.

The fat in the yolk has caused less insulin to be released.

Bodybuilders already have a lot of muscle mass.

In that state, to increase muscle even a little more,

Insulin is needed to assist with anabolism.

Fat hinders muscle growth because it causes less insulin to be released.

So, I'm following a low-fat diet to reduce my fat intake.

The purpose of following a low-fat diet is not for weight loss, but for muscle growth.

So, does that mean you can't lose weight on a low-fat diet?

No, that's not the case.

To increase muscle mass, the number of muscle cells needs to increase.

Energy is consumed in the process of creating muscle cells.

Some of that energy comes from body fat, so body fat does decrease.

So just because you follow a low-fat diet doesn't mean you won't lose weight.

The purpose of following a low-fat diet is for muscle growth.

Since bodybuilders follow a low-fat diet, it must be the most effective diet for weight loss.

You shouldn't think like this.

However, when dieting, while reducing body fat is important,

Building muscle is important too, right?

So, isn't it the best to follow a bodybuilder's diet in the end?

A bodybuilder is already in a state of having a lot of muscle mass.

The goal is to increase muscle mass beyond its limits and maintain it.

So, I do an enormous amount of exercise.

It involves following a diet that drastically restricts one of the nutrients our body needs, which is fat.

However, a non-bodybuilder has a different physical condition compared to a bodybuilder.

You have a high amount of body fat and low muscle mass.

So there is no problem increasing muscle mass without using extreme methods.

When talking about dieting, it is common to bring up the example of bodybuilders.

People who need to diet and bodybuilders

The goals are different for dieting and muscle growth.

Having a lot of body fat and little muscle versus having little body fat and a lot of muscle.

Because the condition of the body is different.

There are many issues with comparing them as they are.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

Not all the carbohydrates I eat turn into body fat.

Because there is a difference in calories between carbohydrates and fats.

It is true that even if carbohydrates are stored as body fat, the amount is not significant.

However, carbohydrates stimulate insulin the most.

Insulin stores the fats we eat as body fat.

To lose weight, you need to reduce your carbohydrate intake.

Second

To diet, it is recommended to reduce carbohydrates.

It means to reduce what you used to eat a lot to a moderate amount.

It's not that you should completely avoid eating, nor is it true that eating less is always better for dieting.

Third

A person on a diet and a bodybuilder are

The purpose of following a diet varies.

Because muscle mass and body fat are different, and the amount of exercise is different.

It is not appropriate to compare.

I can organize it like this.

You shouldn't eat too much, and you shouldn't eat too little either, so you're saying to eat in moderation, right?

But aren't you going to tell me how much is appropriate to eat?

Each person has different amounts of muscle mass and body fat.

Because the amount of activity and the amount of exercise are different.

The appropriate amount of food varies from person to person.

You need to find the right portion size for your body on your own.

In the past, I explained the principles of dieting and talked in detail about how to manage your diet.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top left.

If you are curious about what food to eat and how much, you can click here to find out.

You mentioned that if you eat too few carbohydrates or fats, your basal metabolic rate decreases.

It is said that when your basal metabolic rate decreases, you become more prone to gaining weight.

If eating too little makes it easy to gain weight, then that makes sense.

On the contrary, shouldn't there also be bodies that find it difficult to gain weight even when eating a lot?

Yes, that's right.

There is actually such a mechanism.

I previously made a detailed explanation video because the same question came up.

I will make sure related videos appear in the top right.

There is a debate about whether the cause of obesity is carbohydrates or fats.

There is also a debate about breakfast, you know?

There are sayings that you need to have breakfast to lose weight.

If I eat breakfast, I actually gain weight.

There is a saying that skipping breakfast can help you lose weight.

What is correct?

This question came up before, so I made a video about it.
