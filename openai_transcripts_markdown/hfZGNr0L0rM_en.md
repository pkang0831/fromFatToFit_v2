The reason why others are losing weight but you are not.

Hello, this is pkang.

One of the popular dieting methods that many people choose is to follow the example of those who have succeeded.

However, there are quite a few cases where following the diet exactly does not yield much effect.

So we followed the same diet, but why does that person see results while I don't?

Is my body type a cursed one that makes it difficult to diet?

Sometimes, people blame their own constitution.

Why does this difference occur?

Even with the same diet, the reason why the effects appear differently is

Current weight and target weight, body fat and muscle mass, activity level and exercise amount, lifestyle patterns, and digestive ability.

This is because differences arise from other factors.

In simple terms, everyone is different.

So even with the same diet method, the effects can vary.

For example, there have been instances where comments like this have been posted as questions.

Why are there people who eat white rice on their diet and are slimmer than me, who eats brown rice?

Simply put, a person who eats brown rice should be slimmer than someone who eats white rice.

However, different results may occur due to differences in other factors.

In the case of someone who is usually very active and exercises regularly,

Because there is a lot of muscle mass and a high amount of energy is consumed through activities or exercise.

Eating some processed foods is not really a problem.

There are actually quite a few cases where you need to intentionally eat white rice.

The reason why unprocessed foods are said to be good for dieting is

Because it has a low nutritional density, you won't become obese even if you eat a large amount.

However, if we say this in reverse,

Because of its low nutritional density

In situations where a lot of energy is consumed, it can lead to shortages.

In reality, people who have a very high exercise intensity require a significant amount of carbohydrates for their bodies.

There are quite a few cases where it is difficult to supplement this with unrefined carbohydrates.

So even if you eat a lot of unrefined carbohydrates, you may still experience symptoms of carbohydrate deficiency.

In such cases, it is necessary to intentionally consume carbohydrates that are high in nutritional density.

However, if someone who doesn't exercise tries to follow this, it could have the opposite effect.

So, because they have a high level of activity and exercise diligently, this is the diet of a slim YouTuber who eats white rice.

This means that if a person with low activity levels and no exercise follows it, it can have the opposite effect.

So, does that mean I need to follow not only the diet but also the exercise and lifestyle patterns?

Rather than that, it is more important to follow a diet that suits oneself.

How should I plan a diet that suits me?

You can eat it in a way that is not regular compared to the food I was originally eating.

Regarding refined and unrefined foods.

In the video I made before about [how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods], I explained it in detail.

The concept of unrefined food is applied relatively here.

For example, when comparing brown rice and white rice, brown rice is an unrefined food, while white rice is a refined food.

When comparing sugar, flour, and white rice.

Sugar and flour are refined foods. White rice is less refined than sugar and flour.

White rice is processed, but sugar and flour are processed even more.

The advice to eat unprocessed foods is more about encouraging a certain way of eating rather than suggesting specific foods.

It means to eat less processed foods compared to what I used to eat.

It's not about having to follow someone else; it's about the food I was originally eating being the standard.

So, a person who often eats snacks can lose weight by stopping the snacks, even if they continue to eat white rice.

A person who used to eat white rice instead of snacks will lose weight if they eat brown rice instead of white rice.

If it's difficult to eat brown rice, you can mix it with white rice.

Mixing brown rice and white rice is healthier than just eating white rice alone.

To summarize,

A diet that someone has successfully followed is one that is suitable for their body.

If the person has similar conditions to that person, the same diet may be effective.

It's natural for different effects to appear in people with different conditions.

The diet of someone who has already reached the weight or body shape I aim for.

If you want to follow along exactly but find it difficult and can't do it,

It is natural that it cannot be done.

That person is already in a condition that allows them to follow that diet.

We are starting the diet now, right?

And even though I followed the diet exactly, I didn't see much effect.

There is no need to blame your constitution or feel frustrated.

You just need to follow a diet that suits your body.

If it's difficult to stick to a strict diet, you can start lightly.

As mentioned in the Thought Diet series, there's no need to be perfect from the start.

First, start by eating a little less than what you normally eat.

Once you start and get used to it, you can change your diet.

A person who simply cannot give up sweet snacks or bread.

First, I reduced snacks and bread as much as possible, and when I wanted something sweet, I started eating fruit.

The desire for snacks or bread has decreased, making it easier to diet.

Someone who has only eaten white rice is saying they can't eat brown rice because it feels rough.

As I started mixing white rice and brown rice, I became accustomed to brown rice.

Later on, there are times when I just comfortably eat brown rice.

In the early stages of my diet, when it was hard to exercise, I significantly reduced my carbohydrate intake.

As the diet progresses and I start exercising diligently,

There are many cases where people end up eating carbohydrates comfortably.

It doesn't have to be perfect from the start, and you don't have to force yourself to follow others.

It is best to start with a diet that suits you.
