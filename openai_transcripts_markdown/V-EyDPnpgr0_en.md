The reason you are starting your diet from tomorrow - Thought Diet Part 2

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video about thoughts on dieting.

In the first part of the video, I talked about how optical illusions can lead us to unknowingly overeat.

In this video, we will discuss the impact of calorie perception on dieting.

There's a saying, "I'll start my diet tomorrow."

I know that I need to diet, and I think I want to diet, but...

It feels a bit lacking to start right now.

I want to eat foods that I won't be able to eat starting tomorrow.

So many people tend to wait just one more day before starting their diet from tomorrow.

This led to the saying, "I'll start my diet tomorrow."

However, even if you gather your resolve and start a diet, many people tend to quit after just two or three days.

Why do people not start their diet right away and instead say they will start tomorrow?

If it hasn't been long since you started your diet, it shouldn't be that difficult.

Why do people stop dieting?

There is a hormone called ghrelin.

This hormone is the one that makes you feel hungry.

When the level of ghrelin increases, hunger intensifies.

When the level of ghrelin decreases, hunger weakens.

The reason our hunger decreases when we eat is that this hormone decreases.

There is an experiment on calories and the ghrelin hormone, and this experiment is quite interesting.

Have one person drink a can of the beverage that is labeled as 620 kcal.

After having one can of a beverage that is labeled as 140 kcal for another person,

When the ghrelin hormone levels of the two individuals were measured,

The person who drank the beverage labeled 620 kcal had a significant decrease in their ghrelin hormone levels.

People who drank a beverage labeled as 140 kcal experienced a smaller decrease in ghrelin hormone levels.

Drinking high-calorie beverages significantly reduces ghrelin, while drinking low-calorie beverages slightly reduces ghrelin.

Isn't it a natural result?

What is an interesting experiment?

If the calories written on the surface of the beverage are the same as the actual calories, then that's correct.

However, the actual calories of both beverages were the same at 380 kcal.

It was just that the calories written on the outside were different.

Then the actual calories consumed are the same.

Does that mean you felt hunger differently based on the calories written on the beverage?

Does that make sense?

Yes, that makes perfect sense.

The influence of the mind on the body is quite significant.

If you tell someone that a completely ineffective drug is an effective one and make them take it,

There are instances where the effects of the medication become apparent.

This phenomenon is called the placebo effect.

So regardless of the actual calories,

Is the calorie content of the food I ate high or low?

This means that based on this information about calories, one can feel hunger differently.

I will reduce the amount of food I eat to lose weight.

When you have such thoughts, your body is influenced by them.

Because I think I will have to live a hungry life due to the reduced amount of food I eat.

The desire for food increases.

Due to this increased appetite, I end up wanting to eat more food today.

So I decided to start my diet today, but I decided to actually begin the diet tomorrow.

Today, having decided to diet, I end up eating even more food, which is a strange behavior.

And after the diet started,

The diet I am currently following is a low-calorie diet.

Since I'm eating like this with such low calories, I should lose weight.

Such thoughts can intensify hunger, making dieting more difficult.

That's why people give up on their diet after just 2 or 3 days.

To summarize,

Many people believe that in order to lose weight, they must reduce the calories in the food they eat.

So I calculate the calories of the food I eat and try to intentionally eat less.

This actually makes the hunger even worse.

It can make dieting difficult or lead to giving up.

As mentioned in the video on [How to Distinguish Between Foods That Make You Gain Weight and Foods That Help You Lose Weight],

Just by changing the types of food you eat, you can lose weight without necessarily eating low-calorie foods.

Rather than eating low-calorie foods, it is better to change the types of foods you eat.

In the next video, I will talk about an experiment that showed how simply changing one's mindset can affect dieting.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the Thought Diet series,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
