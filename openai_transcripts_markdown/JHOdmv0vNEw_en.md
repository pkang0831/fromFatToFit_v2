Do diet products or supplements really work?

Hello, this is pkang.

There are quite a few comments asking whether diet products or supplements are effective.

Oat flour, sprout seed powder, sprouted barley powder, many people ask about digestive enzymes in a very diverse way.

In this video, we will discuss whether such products are effective.

To explain dieting simply, it can be described in a very straightforward way.

To explain it in a complicated way, I could make it endlessly complex.

The reason this happens is that dieting is the result of multiple factors coming together.

For example, there is a video about leafy greens that was made right before this one.

For those who haven't seen the video, let me briefly summarize the content.

To diet, you need to reduce your intake of refined foods.

A person who has no choice but to eat refined foods, like a student who has to eat school meals.

It is helpful to eat leafy vegetables along with processed foods.

To simply reduce the intake of processed foods, I'm hungry because there's a lack of food.

Leafy vegetables have a volume that provides a feeling of fullness, helping to prevent hunger.

One of the problems with processed foods is that they are digested and absorbed too quickly.

The dietary fiber in leafy vegetables has the effect of slowing down digestion and absorption.

Processed foods are mostly high in sodium, and a lot of sodium increases appetite.

Leafy vegetables have the effect of expelling sodium from the body, which helps in appetite control.

So simply put, it means that eating leafy greens is helpful.

If we examine in detail why it is helpful, various factors are influencing it.

However, the impact of each of these factors is not absolutely significant.

Each individual factor has a small impact, but when many factors combine, they create a significant effect.

So if you focus too much on just this one factor, it can actually lead to problems.

For example, if you focus too much on just one thing, like dietary fiber,

Dietary fiber slows down digestion and absorption, which helps with weight loss.

It is possible to interpret it this way.

And if interpreted that way, all foods containing dietary fiber can be considered diet foods.

Dietary fiber supplements, designed for easy consumption of fiber, end up becoming diet supplements.

Of course, I can't say that dietary fiber has no effect on dieting at all.

Dietary fiber slows down digestion and absorption, which is indeed helpful for dieting.

However, taking dietary fiber supplements can help with weight loss.

Or, since some foods are high in dietary fiber, you must eat those foods if you want to diet.

This means that I can't say it like this.

The impact of dietary fiber is significant, but just having it alone doesn't guarantee weight loss.

For example, while eating refined foods, consuming leafy greens can be helpful for dieting, but...

If you eat marinated meat and white rice at a barbecue restaurant, along with leafy vegetables, and then drink a carbonated beverage,

Even if you eat leafy vegetables to obtain dietary fiber, it does not have a weight loss effect.

It's because I've eaten too much processed food.

So at the end of the video, it says that eating leafy greens is helpful.

The statement is not that you can eat a lot of processed foods as long as you eat leafy greens.

So you can think of it like a jigsaw puzzle.

Just having one puzzle piece doesn't mean it's complete.

To complete it, the other pieces are also needed.

The problem is that diet products or supplements are created by focusing on a specific factor.

Just because you have that doesn't mean you'll lose weight.

For example, if there is a deficiency of vitamin B, energy metabolism decreases and lethargy occurs.

In this case, the calorie consumption decreases, which is not good for dieting.

So, foods or products rich in vitamin B are said to be good for dieting.

Vitamin D plays a role in helping to convert fat into energy.

Foods or products rich in vitamin D are said to be good for dieting.

Magnesium has the effect of promoting the secretion of the leptin hormone, which lowers appetite.

Eating foods or products rich in magnesium can help with appetite control, making it beneficial for dieting.

Even if you consume these nutrients, it is meaningless if your body does not absorb them.

It is said that taking digestive enzymes that help with digestion and absorption is good for dieting.

These stories are not entirely baseless.

It is not necessary to eat specific foods or diet products.

So what should we do?

You said that even a single factor is necessary, even if its influence is small, right?

Does that mean I need to take multiple diet products because one alone is not effective?

No, what I mean is that there's no need to focus too much on each individual thing.

To obtain vitamin B, what products should I consume?

What supplements should I take to obtain vitamin D?

What foods should I eat to obtain magnesium?

Don't approach it this way; just make sure to eat a variety of vegetables in moderation.

Vegetables are rich in various vitamins and minerals.

So if you eat unprocessed foods in moderation, it will resolve itself.

Focusing too much on each individual thing actually makes it more complicated.

And there are many overlapping nutrients in food.

For example, cabbage is rich in dietary fiber, which is good for dieting, but...

It is not necessary to eat cabbage to obtain dietary fiber.

Dietary fiber is abundant in other vegetables as well.

And this is not only true for dietary fiber; the same applies to other vitamins, minerals, and nutrients as well.

So, even if it is true that oats or barley sprouts have certain components and that "this is good for dieting,"

That ingredient is not only found in oats or barley sprouts, but it is also present in other foods.

If you like oats or sprouted barley and want to eat them, it's fine to do so.

If you ask, "Do I have to eat this for my diet even though I don't really want to?"

There is no need for that.

However, the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals necessary for health and dieting are

They say that in order to get enough nutrients from food, you have to eat a lot, so you should take supplements or nutritional aids.

There is indeed such a story.

However, the basic principle is that nutrients are obtained from food, and that is normal.

Nutritional supplements and aids have only been around for a few decades.

Before that, I was getting everything I needed through food without any supplements or aids.

Now, suddenly, I can't get what I need through food.

It's strange to think that one needs to take supplements or dietary aids.

The reason people have such misunderstandings is that they are led to misunderstand in that way.

The most commonly used example is that of vitamin C and apples.

The recommended daily intake of vitamin C is 100mg.

However, the vitamin C content in a fist-sized apple weighing 200g is only 10mg.

So, if you want to get the recommended daily amount of vitamin C from apples,

You need to eat 10 to 11 apples a day. That's quite a large amount.

It's said that it's better to take supplements because there is too much to eat.

The standard for vitamin C should not be based on apples from the beginning.

Apples have a low vitamin C content.

The weight of a single broccoli that can be easily found in a supermarket is about 250 to 300 grams.

The vitamin C content in 100g of broccoli is about 90mg.

So, if you eat just half a broccoli, you can meet the daily recommended intake of vitamin C.

It means that it can be sufficiently consumed as food.

So, you can get enough nutrition from food in the first place.

They intentionally set a low-content food as the standard to make it seem like it can't be eaten.

Since it's hard to eat it like this, they sell blenders, saying to grind it and drink it.

To someone who struggles to use a blender, they sell supplements while telling them to take supplements.

In broadcasts, they promote certain foods by saying that the vitamin C content is several times higher than that of apples.

However, apples are rich in other nutrients rather than vitamin C from the beginning.

It's strange to use an apple as an example when talking about vitamin C.

I will summarize.

There are a variety of factors that influence dieting.

The impact of each factor is not very significant.

Many small factors that have a minor impact come together to create the significant outcome of dieting.

In the case of diet supplements, aids, and products, they are created with a focus on specific factors.

One factor has little impact, so just eating that alone won't lead to weight loss.

Many people have actually used diet products but did not see any results.

It's a case where most people don't follow a separate diet but only consume diet products.

On the contrary, there are also people who have seen positive effects.

These people, while I am working hard to lose weight,

Additionally, this is a case where such a product was used.

In this case, is the weight loss due to the effects of the diet product?

Or maybe it's a bit unclear whether I've lost weight due to the effects of the diet I've been working hard on.

However, in most cases, there is a high probability of duplication.

For example, I was eating an oat product because some of its ingredients are said to be good for dieting.

In fact, that ingredient was already present in other foods I eat.

In that case, it doesn't make a difference whether you eat oat products or not, since they were already overlapping anyway.

So, after trying the diet products, I felt that they were effective.

If you would like to continue writing, you may keep using it.

It's not a problem if there is duplication.

And although the probability is low, there was one factor that was lacking in the diet I was following.

There is a possibility that the product happens to meet that requirement.

"Since I'm spending money on diet products, I should work hard on my diet."

There is a possibility that it provided help in a mental aspect as well.

However, in this case, there are often instances of yo-yo dieting when the product is no longer consumed.

A person who has lost weight by taking appetite suppressants to reduce their appetite.

A typical example is that when you stop taking appetite suppressants, your appetite increases, leading to weight gain again.

So if you don't plan to take that product for a lifetime,

Please investigate the mechanism through which it is effective.

We need to find an alternative method.

If you have a strong appetite and need to take appetite suppressants, you should know how to return your appetite to normal.

If you are lacking in vitamins or minerals, you should eat a lot of foods that are rich in them.

If having a weak digestive system is the problem, you need to seek treatment or find ways to strengthen it.

All of this is included in the diet.

And when you break it down one by one, it feels very complicated and difficult.

Ultimately, what we need to do is reduce our intake of processed and refined foods.

It means eating a variety of unprocessed, whole foods and getting some exercise.

If you just do that, all those problems will be resolved.

I have made a lot of videos about dieting.

Each video has a different theme, but the reason the conclusions are always similar is because of this.

Don't have too high expectations or rely too much on diet products or supplements.

If you take an interest in the most basic things, you will naturally be able to lose weight.
