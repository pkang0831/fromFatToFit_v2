Does eating a lot of protein frequently help build muscle quickly?

Hello, this is pkang.

You should not consume more than 30g of protein at once.

It is better to eat protein in small amounts frequently rather than consuming a large amount at once.

There are various discussions about how much and in what way protein should be consumed for muscle growth.

In this video, we will explore which stories are true and why these stories have emerged.

The reason behind the claim that there is no need to consume more than 30g of protein at once is...

It is due to an experiment comparing the rate of muscle synthesis based on protein intake.

Protein is used as a building block for muscle.

The common belief among people is that consuming a lot of protein is beneficial for muscle synthesis.

To verify this idea, various experiments were conducted.

When comparing groups that consume 10g of protein, 20g of protein, and 40g of protein,

The group that consumed 20g of protein had a higher muscle synthesis rate compared to the group that consumed 10g.

However, there was not much difference in the muscle synthesis rates between the group that consumed 20g and the group that consumed 40g.

If we think about the difference between the 10g group and the 20g group,

When protein intake is insufficient, it can be observed that the rate of muscle synthesis decreases.

However, the fact that there was no significant difference between the 20g group and the 40g group means that

Eating a lot of protein does not mean that the rate of muscle synthesis will increase indefinitely.

There have been experiments that compare things in a more extreme way.

When comparing the group that consumes 30g of protein to the group that consumes 90g.

There was no significant difference in the adhesion rate between these two groups.

So, the limit for protein is about 20 to 30 grams.

Consuming more than this does not significantly increase the rate of muscle synthesis.

As information about such experiments became known,

Eating a large amount of protein at once is meaningless. It is said that it should be consumed in portions of 30 grams.

So, does that mean I should eat 30g every hour?

That's not the case.

There was an experiment comparing 80g of protein over a 12-hour period with different time intervals.

A group that consumed 10g of protein every 1 hour and 30 minutes, for a total of 8 times.

A group that consumed 20g of protein every 3 hours, four times.

A group that consumed 40g of protein twice every 6 hours.

When comparing the three groups in this way, the group that consumed 20g four times had the highest muscle synthesis rate.

The important point here is that the group that consumed 20g four times had a higher muscle synthesis rate than the group that consumed 10g eight times.

In the beginning of the video, a comparison was made between the group that consumed 10g of protein and the group that consumed 20g.

The reason the group that consumed 20g has a higher muscle synthesis rate is that the total amount of protein consumed is different between 10g and 20g.

10g of protein is too little, and consuming 20g of protein is more beneficial for muscle synthesis.

However, in this experiment, the total amount of protein consumed is the same at 80g.

It's just a matter of whether you take 10 grams every 10 hours and 30 minutes for a total of 8 times, or whether you take 20 grams every 3 hours for a total of 4 times.

So, it means that when consuming the same amount of protein but eating it in smaller, more frequent portions, the rate of muscle synthesis is lower.

However, this is not easy to understand.

It is common knowledge that eating small amounts frequently is better for absorption in the body than consuming a large quantity all at once.

In that case, consuming 10g at a time is better for absorption in the body than eating 20g at once.

The group that consumes 10g, which is absorbed better by the body, has a higher muscle synthesis rate than the group that consumes 20g.

It should have come out at least somewhat similar, but it actually came out even lower.

Why is this result occurring?

It is due to the concentration of amino acids in the blood.

When we consume carbohydrates, the concentration of glucose in the blood increases.

When you consume protein, the concentration of amino acids in the blood increases.

When the concentration of amino acids in the blood increases, the body works to lower it.

Nitrogen is separated from amino acids and used as energy.

So when you consume protein and the concentration of amino acids in the blood increases,

This amino acid is not used for muscle synthesis but is used for energy.

When the concentration of amino acids in the blood decreases, muscle synthesis then proceeds.

Eating protein every 1 hour and 30 minutes means that the concentration of amino acids in the blood increases every 1 hour and 30 minutes.

At this time, amino acids are continuously used for energy, which leads to a decrease in the rate of muscle synthesis.

If you are interested in intermittent fasting, which involves eating for 8 hours a day and fasting for 16 hours,

You may have heard that intermittent fasting is beneficial for muscle development.

However, when this story first came out,

Many people found it hard to understand why someone would eat protein frequently to build muscle.

Because building muscle requires three things: exercise, rest, and nutrition.

So there’s a saying that even eating is a form of exercise. I’m diligently making sure to eat chicken breast and supplements on time.

Intermittent fasting, which involves not eating anything for 16 hours, is beneficial for muscle development.

It's hard to understand, isn't it?

However, when comparing people who consume protein too frequently with those who practice intermittent fasting,

In fact, there are experimental results showing that intermittent fasting is beneficial for muscle synthesis.

A person who used to take supplements and eat chicken breast every hour to build muscle

After trying intermittent fasting myself, I experienced that muscle growth became easier.

Now, such stories are being accepted.

The reason this happens is due to the concentration of amino acids in the blood.

Do I have to eat 30g all at once?

That's not the case.

Whenever the topic of experiments comes up, I always have something to say.

If the conditions of the experiment change, the results of the experiment can also change.

In the experiment that appeared at the beginning of the video,

There was no difference between consuming 20g of protein at once and consuming 40g of protein.

The conditions set in this experiment were a situation without any physical activity.

Then, the question arose, "Wouldn't different results come out if we exercise?" Based on this inquiry, an experiment was conducted that included exercise.

When I added the condition of doing high-intensity full-body workouts,

Consuming 40g of protein showed a higher muscle synthesis rate than consuming 20g of protein.

So, based on people who do not engage in high-intensity exercise, there was no difference between 20g of protein and 40g of protein.

For those who engage in high-intensity exercise, an additional 40g of protein is more effective.

In another video, you mentioned that high-intensity exercise is determined by the intensity rather than the type of exercise, right?

So you said that for people with severe obesity, even just walking quickly counts as high-intensity exercise.

So, does that mean that for people with severe obesity, just walking quickly and eating a lot of protein can be effective?

That's right.

To put it more extreme, in the case of severe obesity, even without brisk walking, a lot of protein can be effective.

Because moving a heavy object requires a lot of energy.

A person who weighs a lot develops muscles to move their heavy body.

Because of this, individuals with severe obesity may have high muscle mass measured on the InBody, even without any exercise experience.

Just moving a heavy body itself becomes exercise, resulting in muscle development.

There was also an experiment comparing the rate of protein synthesis based on body weight under conditions where no exercise was performed.

It has been found that the higher the body weight, the more protein one consumes, which can lead to an increase in muscle synthesis rate.

When discussing the recommended protein intake, it is not specified as a certain number of grams.

It tells you how many grams you should eat per kilogram of body weight, and that's because of this.

I will summarize.

When you consume protein, the concentration of amino acids in the blood increases.

If this rises too often, it can interfere with the occlusion.

Eating protein too frequently can actually hinder muscle growth.

It is recommended to consume protein at intervals of about 5 to 6 hours.

The amount of protein consumed at one time, for the average person, doesn't make much difference beyond 30g.

So there is no need to eat more than 30g.

However, the heavier you are and the higher the intensity of your exercise, the more protein can be effectively utilized.

People who weigh a lot or engage in high-intensity exercise can increase their protein intake a bit more without any issues.

Sounds plausible, right?
