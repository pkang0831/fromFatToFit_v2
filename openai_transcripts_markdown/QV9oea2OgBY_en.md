Can you lose weight from being average to slim while eating until you're full?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I have a video I made in the past that explains the principles of dieting.

Many people believe that in order to diet, one must use body fat.

So I think I should eat less food.

This is a video that says otherwise.

You can diet without eating less food.

However, there was a question in the comments of that video about how to diet from being average to being slim.

I have fully understood the principle that you can lose weight without eating less.

So, I think the method shown in the video could help with weight loss from obesity to a normal weight.

It's a question about whether the same method can be used to go from normal to thin.

So simply put, doesn't that mean you have to starve to become a thin body?

To put it simply, no.

In fact, to diet from being average to slim, you shouldn't eat less.

You need to eat enough.

Let's talk about why that is in detail.

The video link is currently being displayed in the top right corner.

The body fat in our body can be broadly divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

First, visceral fat refers to the fat that is located right next to the organs.

Because it is close to the internal organs, it has the characteristic of being easily utilized as energy.

So, it is the fat that serves as an energy storage.

And the human body is designed to protect the internal organs.

The abdominal muscles, which are part of the body, are structured to cover the internal organs and visceral fat.

So when visceral fat increases, it pushes the abdominal muscles outward.

Simply put, the belly is sticking out.

Muscles like the abdominal muscles are inherently elastic and firm.

When you touch the belly protruding due to visceral fat, it feels firm.

I feel a firmness when I press it.

The second type of subcutaneous fat refers to the fat located just beneath the skin.

The only place where internal organs are located in the human body is the abdomen, but the skin covers the entire body.

So, the subcutaneous fat is located on the outermost part of the body, excluding the skin.

It has the characteristic of being scattered throughout the entire body.

Due to these characteristics, it is difficult to utilize fat as energy.

The distance from the internal organs is too far, and they are scattered throughout the entire body.

Instead, because of those characteristics

It has the effect of protecting the body from external shocks or preventing the loss of body heat.

So it is fat that serves the role of clothing.

And because subcutaneous fat is structurally located outside of the muscles,

It's fat that muscles can't hold.

Although the skin covers the subcutaneous fat,

The skin is less elastic and not as firm compared to muscles.

So when there is an increase in body fat, it tends to sag due to gravity and feels soft to the touch.

What we commonly refer to as fat is actually this subcutaneous fat.

Among the two types of fat mentioned earlier,

What type of fat becomes problematic when trying to lose weight from average to slim?

It is subcutaneous fat.

Let's think simply.

Are there people who are trying to lose weight from average to slim and are worried about their protruding belly?

There is none.

During the process of dieting from obesity, most of the protruding belly is resolved.

Because the fat that makes the belly protrude is visceral fat.

Visceral fat is located close to the organs, which makes it easily convertible into energy.

So during the dieting process, it decreases faster than subcutaneous fat.

So if you have dieted from obesity to a normal weight, most of your visceral fat is likely to have decreased significantly.

And in the first place, you wouldn't typically refer to someone with a protruding belly as having an average body type.

So, the concerns of people trying to lose weight from being average to being slim are

It's sagging fat like the fat on the arms, thighs, back, and belly.

As mentioned earlier, that sagging flesh is subcutaneous fat.

So, in order to lose weight from being average to being slim,

You need to focus on ways to reduce subcutaneous fat.

So, what should be done to reduce subcutaneous fat?

You need to exercise.

When you exercise, your muscle mass increases.

When you use the muscles that have increased like this, heat is generated inside the body.

Humans are warm-blooded animals, which means that their body temperature must be maintained at a constant level.

It is not good if the body temperature drops too low, but it is also not good if it rises too high.

So, in order to maintain a constant body temperature, the heat generated by the muscles needs to be released outside the body.

The thing that hinders this is subcutaneous fat.

As mentioned earlier, subcutaneous fat has the effect of preventing the loss of body heat.

So, in a situation where there is low muscle mass and low activity level, the heat generated by the body is also low.

Subcutaneous fat helps to prevent the loss of body heat, aiding in the maintenance of body temperature.

When muscle mass and activity levels increase, and there is a lot of heat generated within the body,

Subcutaneous fat prevents the loss of heat, which interferes with maintaining body temperature.

So, when muscle mass and activity levels increase, there arises a need to reduce subcutaneous fat.

Therefore, subcutaneous fat is the type of fat that effectively burns off when you exercise.

So, does that mean I just need to eat less and exercise hard?

No, that's not the case.

Basically, for muscles to grow, three things are needed: load, nutrition, and rest.

The load provides stimulation to the muscles beyond their limits through exercise.

It serves the role of signaling that more muscle is needed.

Nutrition provides the energy needed for exercise and

It plays a role in supplying the nutrients necessary for building muscle.

Finally, rest plays a role in providing the time necessary for muscle growth.

So, even eating and resting are considered exercise.

If any one of these three is lacking, muscles will not grow properly.

In the beginning of the video, there is a question about whether to go from average to slim, one must eat less or starve, right?

The reason I said that you should eat well, on the contrary, is because of this.

If you eat less or skip meals, you won't have enough energy to exercise properly.

Even if you force yourself to exercise, proper muscle growth will not occur.

In reality, if you eat less or starve yourself, your body becomes weak, leading to a decrease in activity levels.

In severe cases, muscle mass can also decrease.

When physical activity and muscle mass decrease, the heat generated by the body also decreases.

In this case, more subcutaneous fat will be needed to maintain body temperature.

So when you are dieting to go from average to slim,

Eating less food can actually have the opposite effect.

Eat plenty with a proper diet.

Based on that, you need to exercise hard to go from average to slim.

However, no matter how correct the diet is,

If you eat enough to not feel hungry, won't your body fat increase?

Then it seems impossible to have a skinny body.

First of all, it is true that if you eat enough, your body fat will increase even if you exercise.

Specifically, visceral fat increases.

When muscle mass increases and activity levels rise, the energy that the body consumes also increases.

In this case, from the body's perspective, it needs to handle that energy.

I am trying to accumulate more emergency supplies.

So, the visceral fat that serves as an energy storage increases.

However, the increase in visceral fat does not pose any problem when transitioning from normal to thin.

Because visceral fat is the fat that is held by the abdominal muscles.

Women are likely to know well that even if a woman has a lot of belly fat,

Wearing shapewear can help you look slimmer by providing support and compression.

When the abdominal muscles develop,

Just as shapewear holds in belly fat, abs can help control visceral fat.

So even if visceral fat increases, there is no problem if you still look thin.

And the increasing visceral fat is not that much.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat cannot be supported by muscles.

When subcutaneous fat increases, it inevitably becomes loose and starts to sag.

So, in order to have a lean body, you must find a way to prevent the increase of subcutaneous fat.

So I keep saying not to eat less but to exercise.

I also tried to exercise while dieting.

Since I started exercising, my thighs have become really thick.

Women often find it difficult to build muscle, no matter how hard they exercise.

They say it won't get thicker...

I know it's hard to believe since you're a man, but I really have gotten thicker.

If you can generate heat in your muscles through exercise and use that to reduce subcutaneous fat, then...

If you generate heat in your abdominal muscles through abdominal exercises, will it help reduce belly fat?

However, I heard that spot reduction doesn't work.

And if the loss of subcutaneous fat is due to body temperature,

If you turn on the boiler and wear a padded jacket to keep your body warm,

Can that help reduce body fat?

It's an interesting question. However, all the questions have answer videos.

In a moment, two videos will appear on the screen.

On the left, there should be a video showing how a woman's body becomes more toned when she exercises.

On the right, I will have a video about whether doing abdominal exercises helps lose belly fat.

And the video about whether subcutaneous fat decreases when living in a hot environment is

It is a video related to the one on the right.
