Visceral fat is easy to lose, but subcutaneous fat is not. Is there a good way to lose subcutaneous fat?

This is a question about how to reduce body fat.

To answer this question, the differences between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat need to be considered.

An explanation is needed for the reasons why the dieting methods of men and women differ.

Fat performs three main functions in our body.

The first serves as a shield that protects the body from external shocks.

The second is clothing that keeps the body warm to prevent a drop in body temperature.

Thirdly, when the body lacks energy, it acts as an energy reservoir that supplies energy.

Body fat can be classified into two types: visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat refers to the fat located next to the internal organs.

Because it is located deepest within the body, it cannot be utilized as a shield or clothing.

It's a good fat to use as an energy reserve because it's located right next to the internal organs.

Subcutaneous fat is the fat located between the skin and the muscles.

Because it is far from the intestines, it is difficult to utilize it as an energy store.

It is a good type of fat to use as a shield and clothing because it is located just beneath the skin.

In simple terms, visceral fat serves as an energy storage, while subcutaneous fat acts as a shield and clothing.

Because the roles are different, the methods for losing fat are also different.

By looking at the differences between male and female obesity, we can understand it in more detail.

To build muscle, male hormones are necessary.

Men have higher levels of male hormones, while women have lower levels.

This difference causes men to have more muscle than women.

Muscles have the characteristic of generating heat when used.

Humans are warm-blooded animals, so their body temperature should not drop too low, nor should it rise too high.

So when the body temperature rises due to muscle activity, it needs to dissipate heat to lower the temperature.

Subcutaneous fat acts as a barrier that prevents heat loss, so it can be a hindrance.

Therefore, the necessity of body fat decreases.

However, if a lot of energy is consumed by muscles, there is a need to store a significant amount of energy in the body.

Therefore, the necessity for visceral fat, which serves as an energy storage, increases.

For this reason, men tend to store fat primarily as visceral fat.

Men often have visceral fat obesity.

The only place in the entire body where the internal organs are located is the abdomen, and they are situated inside, deeper than the muscles.

When visceral fat accumulates, it gradually pushes the muscles outward.

So, visceral fat obesity is characterized by the belly swelling up like a balloon.

In fact, in the case of male obesity, most men have a significantly protruding belly.

Women have less muscle mass than men because they have lower levels of male hormones.

Because there is a low amount of muscle mass, not much energy is consumed by the muscles.

The necessity of visceral fat as an energy storage is low, but

Due to having low muscle mass, the muscles cannot serve as a protective shield for the body.

Therefore, the necessity of subcutaneous fat, which can serve as a shield, increases.

Because there is a low amount of muscle mass, there isn't much heat generated from the muscles.

To maintain body temperature with less heat, more subcutaneous fat, which acts as clothing, is needed.

Moreover, women have breasts and a uterus, which men do not have.

The breasts and uterus also need protection like a shield and clothing, which is why they require more subcutaneous fat than men.

So when women store fat, they primarily store it as subcutaneous fat.

Women often have subcutaneous fat obesity.

Subcutaneous fat is distributed throughout the body and is located outside of the muscles.

Muscle cannot hold onto fat.

So, subcutaneous fat obesity results in an overall thickening of the body.

The flesh becomes loose and starts to sag.

To summarize only the section on adipose tissue from the content so far:

The man has a lot of muscle mass, so he has less subcutaneous fat accumulation.

It means that women tend to have less muscle mass, which leads to a higher accumulation of subcutaneous fat.

However, if I put this differently,

If women build muscle through exercise, it means they can reduce subcutaneous fat.

The bookworm diet is a representative example.

When sitting in a chair, place a book between your knees.

It's an exercise that involves using the strength of your thighs to hold a book in place so it doesn't fall.

At first, since the strength of the thighs is weak, start with a light book for a few minutes.

When thigh muscles are trained, it is possible to work for several hours with a heavy book.

It is an exercise that builds thigh muscles, and there are many people who have actually slimmed down their thighs.

There is a saying that thigh muscles tighten the fat, which is why thighs become thinner.

Subcutaneous fat is located outside of the muscles, so the muscles cannot hold the subcutaneous fat in place.

It is correct to say that the subcutaneous fat in the thighs has decreased.

Another example is the natural abdominal exercise that involves engaging the core while living.

Alternatively, there is a Pilates breathing technique that involves tightening the lower abdomen to stabilize it and breathing into the ribcage.

Both methods are effective in developing abdominal muscles.

Many people have experienced the effect of actually reducing abdominal subcutaneous fat.

One interesting point is that these methods are effective in reducing subcutaneous fat.

Many women have subcutaneous fat obesity, so there are actually many people who see results.

So there is a lot of interest in this method, and various approaches are being shared.

In the case of men, it is due to visceral fat obesity.

There isn't much effectiveness in methods for reducing subcutaneous fat.

So, they sometimes dismiss this method as pointless.

So, if what we've discussed so far is correct, does that mean that doing abdominal exercises will help lose belly fat?

There is no specific order in which fat is lost, so doing abdominal exercises does not necessarily lead to losing belly fat.

While searching for information related to dieting, you may have come across this kind of talk quite often.

The content of the video so far is the opposite.

In the second part of the video, let's find out why such stories are being mentioned.

I will talk about the best ways to reduce body fat.
