Anorexia due to mental issues - Eating Disorders Part 7

This is the seventh video about eating disorders.

In this video, we will discuss that the cause of anorexia is the desire for recognition.

In the case of anorexia caused by a desire for recognition, it differs from the previously understood causes of anorexia.

The cause of anorexia mentioned in the previous video was based on the desire for beauty.

I want to lose weight and diet to have a slim and beautiful body.

Not properly recognizing the errors in the calorie diet theory can lead to severely restricting calories or

Due to the misconception that one must have a weight similar to that of celebrities to have a beautiful body.

I am trying to drastically reduce the amount of food I eat.

This becomes severe and leads to anorexia.

In cases where anorexia develops for cosmetic purposes,

Knowing that not eating food is not good for beauty is helpful.

If you lose weight by not eating and starving yourself,

As one becomes skinny fat, they may appear fatter than their actual weight.

Poor health can actually make you look less attractive.

And if it gets severe, aging progresses rapidly, which is the biggest enemy of beauty.

The reason for developing anorexia is the desire to become more beautiful.

Since it is said that not eating food is not good for beauty, there is no longer any reason to eat less.

However, in the case of anorexia due to the desire for recognition, this does not apply.

The desire for recognition is the feeling of wanting others to acknowledge and take pride in my efforts.

Or it talks about the feeling of accomplishment that comes from achieving something on my own.

If this is applied to dieting

I want my efforts to be recognized for not giving up on my difficult diet and continuing with it.

If you want to brag about successfully completing a difficult diet,

I feel a sense of accomplishment in achieving a low weight.

In this case, the goal is not to become beautiful through dieting, but rather the low weight itself is the objective.

The content from the previous video is not helpful.

Even if it is not good for beauty and health, as long as I achieve a low weight, I feel satisfied with that.

This emotion is a bit difficult to understand unless you are the person involved.

If you think of it as a game to lose weight, it becomes easier to understand.

Achieving a high score in a game is not something that holds great value.

People who play games all want to achieve high scores, and

To achieve that score, I invested money and time.

As a result, when you achieve a high score in a game, you feel a sense of accomplishment and joy.

Investing money and time to lose weight.

As a result, when the weight decreases, one feels a sense of accomplishment and joy.

The fundamental reason for this problem is that there is no one to acknowledge and provide a sense of achievement.

In the past, when someone did a task, one person would handle both the beginning and the end.

So, the person who did their job well received recognition and felt a sense of accomplishment in their work.

However, in modern society, division of labor is fundamental.

Because multiple people share the same task, there is an effect of increased productivity.

There is a problem where a person who works cannot receive recognition or feel a sense of achievement.

In reality, most people feel a sense of achievement and recognition while doing their work at the company rather than...

I sometimes feel like just one of the many gears in the company.

Most humans have a desire to achieve something by investing time and effort.

Since this desire cannot be fulfilled through work, one ends up seeking other objects.

When the focus is on dieting and weight, problems arise.

The solution is simple.

I need to find something else where I can be recognized and feel a sense of achievement.

It's good to exercise, learn something new, or have a hobby.

Anything that allows me to invest my time and effort and feel a sense of accomplishment is acceptable.

Just having such experiences can reduce the obsession with dieting and being underweight.

When obsession decreases, anorexia also alleviates.

With this video, the causes of anorexia have been summarized.

In the next video, we will discuss the final cause of binge eating disorder.

I will talk about binge eating caused by mental issues.
