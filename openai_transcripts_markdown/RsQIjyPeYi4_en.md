This is the seventh video about a body type that doesn't gain weight.

When talking about a body type that doesn't gain weight, the question that always comes up is

This is a question about mukbang YouTubers.

Mukbang YouTubers eat an incredibly large amount of food that an average person could never consume.

Most of the food consumed at this time is processed and refined food.

If you eat so many processed foods, it's only natural that you would gain weight.

Among mukbang YouTubers, there are many who have slim bodies.

How is this possible? I would like to talk about this.

To conclude, it's due to digestive limits and constitution.

The term "digestive limit" literally refers to the limit of the amount of food that can be digested.

If there is a rice cooker for three people,

Just because you put in rice and water for 10 servings here, can you make rice for 10 servings?

Of course, that's not the case.

There is a limit to the processing capacity of three servings, and we are exceeding that limit.

Even machines have limitations in their processing capacity.

Is there no limit to the human digestive system?

Of course, there is.

There is a limit to the amount of food that the digestive system can digest and absorb at one time.

Food that exceeds that limit is not properly digested or absorbed.

So, if you eat a lot but do it all in one meal, it means you won't gain weight, right?

Yes, that's right.

In fact, there are people who use such methods to lose weight.

A representative example is singer Hong Jin-young.

Hong Jin-young appeared on a show called Radio Star.

I want to eat the food I desire for one meal a day.

At this time, they say that the method of dieting involves eating until they feel like throwing up.

It is not a generally accepted good diet method.

Even if you only eat one meal a day, doubts arise about whether eating a lot can lead to weight loss.

So a question came up asking whether I succeeded in dieting that way.

They sometimes show off their slim body, saying, "Don't you see how I look?"

So even if you eat a large amount of food, if you eat it all in one meal,

It means that you won't gain weight or that you can actually lose weight.

Then isn't just eating one meal a day the best diet method?

No matter what food I eat, I lose weight.

That's not the case.

Such a way of eating can lead to binge eating disorder if not done correctly.

Eating too much food at once puts a significant strain on the digestive system.

It's not good for your health either.

And because humans are animals of adaptation,

Continuously eating a large amount of food increases the limit of digestion.

When the digestive limit increases,

As the amount absorbed increases, it ultimately leads to weight gain.

Lastly, as I mentioned in the last video,

Processed foods have the effect of increasing appetite.

If you eat a lot of processed foods, you often find it hard to be satisfied with just one meal a day.

If you are not satisfied with one meal a day and eat additional food, you will gain weight.

But mukbang YouTubers don't seem to be like that, do they?

There are many people who have been in broadcasting for a long time and eat a lot of processed foods.

This person has remained slim both in the past and now.

If your body has adapted and your digestion limit has increased, shouldn't you be gaining weight now compared to before?

And you mentioned that your appetite has increased, making it difficult to maintain just one meal a day.

Many mukbang YouTubers eat a lot of processed food, but there are also many who are good at only eating one meal a day.

Yes, that's right.

This is where the difference in constitution appears.

In order for a person to live, energy is needed.

And to gain that energy, you need to eat food.

However, we must have our hearts beating at every moment and our lungs breathing.

I can't keep consuming energy like this every moment; I can't eat food like this.

So I store some of the food I eat as fat.

It is taken out and used during the time when food is not being eaten.

This is the body's basic metabolism.

Dieting means that the amount of fat used is greater than the amount of fat stored.

It is not that fat is not stored at all.

However, there are people who have weak basic conversational skills.

You have difficulty storing the food you eat as fat.

It's a love with a low conversion rate.

People with this body type can eat a lot without gaining weight.

Even if you eat a lot of processed foods, there is a characteristic that your appetite does not increase.

In the video about how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods, I talked about it.

Processed foods that allow a large amount of nutrients to enter the body in a short time are referred to as refined foods.

When you eat refined foods, a lot of nutrients enter your body.

The body releases a lot of insulin hormone to process this nutrient.

Insulin also plays a role in storing the food I eat as body fat.

When insulin levels increase, the amount stored as body fat also increases.

This is where the problem arises.

The reason we eat food is to obtain energy from it.

It's to use that energy.

However, if there is too much insulin, the energy stored as body fat becomes excessive.

In this case, there will be a shortage of energy available for immediate use.

From the body's perspective, it lacks the energy to use immediately, so it demands more food.

Because of this, the feeling of fullness from processed foods lasts for a short time.

So, I often find myself wanting to eat.

This is one of the various reasons why processed foods increase appetite.

So, the reason why appetite increases when eating refined foods is...

It's because the food I ate has been stored as body fat too much.

People who have a naturally low fat conversion rate

The food you initially ate does not get stored as fat easily.

My appetite is not increasing.

So, even while eating a lot of processed foods, it's possible to maintain one meal a day.

I understand the reason why appetite doesn't increase, but then what is the reason that the digestive limit doesn't increase?

The digestive limit will increase, and it is already at a heightened state.

If you exercise hard, your muscles will develop.

However, muscles do not continue to develop indefinitely, and it is not possible to have 100kg or 200kg of muscle.

In the beginning, muscle mass increases rapidly, but...

Once a certain amount of muscle mass increases, the rate of growth will decrease.

Eventually, there comes a point where muscle growth almost stops.

The limit of digestion is the same as well.

In the beginning, the limit of rapid digestion increases.

As time goes by, the rate of growth decreases, and eventually, it hardly grows at all.

Just because you have a long-standing diet of eating a lot of food...

The amount of food that can be digested does not increase indefinitely.

So even if a mukbang YouTuber has been living a lifestyle of eating a lot of food for a long time,

It means that you can't digest all that food.

In order for a person to live, their heart must beat and their lungs must breathe every moment.

To do that, energy is consumed at every moment.

Since we can't eat the foods that provide this energy continuously at every moment,

Some of the food you eat is stored as fat.

You said it would be used during the time when you're not eating.

However, people with a naturally low fat conversion rate store less fat.

Because the amount stored as fat is small,

The energy available during the time when food is not consumed is bound to be insufficient.

So what should we do?

I often eat food to supply energy each time.

You need to increase your digestive capacity and eat a lot of food to increase the amount of fat stored.

So, a body type that doesn't gain weight even when eating a lot of food has a low fat conversion rate.

On the contrary, due to a low fat conversion rate in the body.

It means that one can only live by eating frequently or in large quantities.

Behind the advantage of not gaining weight even when eating a lot,

You have to eat a lot in order to endure, so you often suffer from hunger.

Eating a lot of food at once puts continuous strain on the digestive system.

There is also the downside of having to bear much higher food expenses every month compared to an average person.

So in the end, the reason why mukbang YouTubers can eat a lot without gaining weight is their body type, right?

Someone who is not built that way cannot become like a mukbang YouTuber.

So, does that mean the methods discussed in this series are all meaningless?

That's not the case.

It is impossible for an average person to eat as much food as a mukbang YouTuber does.

A body type that doesn't gain weight even after eating 10 or 20 ramen noodles.

For someone who can eat 10 or 20 bowls of ramen, it is a significant trait.

It has no meaning for someone who can't even eat five bowls of ramen.

What we want is to occasionally indulge in refined foods, even if it means overeating 2 to 3 servings.

It's at a level where you can avoid gaining weight.

This level is not a body type with a low fat conversion rate.

The method introduced in this series is definitely feasible.

No matter how hard I study, I can't become the top student in my school.

So, does that mean studying has no meaning, and that I gain nothing from studying?

That's not the case.

I have gained more knowledge and improved my grades compared to the time when I wasn't studying.

In this way, studying has meaning.

Just because you can't become a mukbang YouTuber doesn't mean that...

The story so far is not without meaning.

If you make good use of the methods so far,

You can have a body that doesn't gain weight even when you eat, rather than the body you have now that gains weight no matter how much you eat.

And that's enough.

I always say that dieting is something my body does.

Therefore, my body is the standard.

You don't need to impose that standard on others.
