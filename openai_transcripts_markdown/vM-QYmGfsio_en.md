Hello, this is pkang.

This is a video responding to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

Isn't it true that the number of fat cells in adults does not decrease?

To explain regarding the question,

I made a video titled "The Unfair Reason Behind Fasting Diets" in the past.

The video includes content about cell division and death.

Our bodies continuously undergo the process of old cells dying and new cells being created.

Since fat cells are also cells, they die and disappear after a long time once they are formed.

New fat cells divide to fill the empty spaces.

If the number of fat cells that die from apoptosis is less than the number of fat cells that are created through division,

It mentions that it is helpful for dieting.

The content about adipocytes mentioned in the video and

The information the questioner has about adipocytes is different.

This is a question asking which side is correct.

The process of body fat increasing in a person's body can be broadly divided into two categories.

The first is the proliferation of adipocytes, which is the increase in the number of fat cells. The second is hypertrophy, which is the enlargement of fat cell size.

In the 1900s, when the weight of adults and children increased.

I conducted an experiment to observe how fat cells change.

The experimental results showed that in the case of young children, there was an increase in the number of fat cells due to proliferation.

In adults, the number of fat cells does not change.

It has been found that the size of fat cells increases, resulting in hypertrophy.

Based on the content of this experiment, a theory was developed that obesity is determined in childhood.

In adults, the number of fat cells does not increase; only their size increases.

If I hadn't been obese in my childhood, I would have fewer fat cells.

Therefore, if the number of fat cells that increase in size is small, it becomes difficult to become obese.

On the contrary, a person who was obese in childhood has a significantly increased number of fat cells.

There are many fat cells that increase in size, and therefore, it is easy to become obese.

And the theory that has been additionally developed here is

It was that the increased fat cells after becoming an adult cannot be reduced.

The reason humans evolved to store fat is for survival in situations where food is not available.

In other words, not having fat cells means it is detrimental to survival.

In a time when food is easily accessible, it may seem like having no fat cells would result in a body that easily avoids gaining weight, but...

Before agriculture began, it was quite difficult for humanity to find food.

If there are fewer fat cells and the body cannot store fat, it indicates a constitution that easily starves to death.

The human body reacts in a way that is advantageous for survival.

The reason why eating a lot of refined carbohydrates leads to easy weight gain is

If blood sugar levels rise and cause inflammation in the blood vessel walls, it can endanger life.

It is a survival response to store glucose as body fat in order to lower blood sugar levels.

In cases where one does not eat for a long time or follows a diet with very little food intake.

It is said that when the body experiences hunger responses, it becomes a body type that easily gains weight.

This is also a survival response to survive in a situation where it is difficult to obtain food.

Having fewer fat cells is disadvantageous for survival, but our body responds in a way that is favorable for survival.

Once you become an adult, you cannot increase the number of fat cells, nor can you decrease them.

Therefore, it has been claimed that the increased fat cells from childhood do not decrease.

Simply put, a person who was obese in childhood tends to develop a body type that gains weight easily.

This means that once you become an adult, this constitution does not change.

If we look at the statistics,

People who were obese in childhood often remain obese in adulthood.

So for a while, this theory gained quite a bit of trust, and it was often broadcast on TV.

The most effectively utilized was the liposuction advertisement.

After becoming an adult, if fat cells are removed through liposuction, the number of fat cells will not increase again.

The area where liposuction was performed does not easily gain weight.

And unless it's liposuction, you cannot reduce the number of fat cells.

There was an advertisement claiming that liposuction is the only solution to address a body type that gains weight easily.

That's quite intriguing, isn't it?

The content up to this point is likely what the questioner knows about fat cells.

In the video about why starvation diets are unfair, it was mentioned that the number of fat cells can decrease.

You asked which side of the story is correct, right?

Interestingly, liposuction creates contradictions in the theory of fat cells.

Liposuction is a surgery that artificially removes fat cells.

If the number of fat cells does not increase after becoming an adult, then a person who has undergone liposuction should not experience weight regain.

However, there have been many cases of people who have undergone liposuction becoming obese again.

A representative case from Korea is a celebrity who became a topic of discussion in 2001 for losing 36 kg.

They even released a diet video.

The fact that a doctor revealed information about liposuction became a huge issue.

Of course, considering the figure of 36kg, it is difficult to say that the weight loss was achieved solely through liposuction.

I guess you could say that I personally did the diet and received some help from liposuction surgery.

The important thing is that now, in 2019, that celebrity's body is not much different from before.

I had fat cells removed through liposuction, but they came back.

As such cases have increased, more people have begun to question the theory of adipocytes.

In the 2000s, experiments on fat cells were conducted again.

The purpose of the experiment was to confirm whether the number of adipocytes in adults can increase again.

We will compare the thighs, upper body, abdomen, and lower body while increasing an adult's weight by 3.8 kg.

I didn't specifically aim to increase my weight by exactly 3.8 kg; I was experimenting by eating a lot of food over a certain period.

This means that the average weight increased by 3.8 kg during the experimental period.

The experimental results showed that there was no change in the subcutaneous fat of the thighs and upper body.

Abdominal subcutaneous fat has larger cell sizes, while lower body subcutaneous fat has an increased number of cells.

Since the weight has increased by 3.8 kg, there are areas that have not shown any changes.

The number of subcutaneous fat cells in the lower body has increased.

So the theory that the number of fat cells in adults remains constant is being challenged.

The theory that fat cells do not increase, and therefore do not decrease, is also being challenged.

What is the difference in results compared to experiments from the 1900s? (voice modulation)

In the 1900s, only the subcutaneous fat cells of adults and children were compared.

At that time, it was assumed that all fat cells were just the same type of fat cell.

I thought that all areas with fat cells would show the same reaction.

In experiments from the 2000s, it was found that subcutaneous abdominal fat only increased in size.

The experimental results were not manipulated, nor were the experiments conducted incorrectly.

I didn't know that fat cells respond differently depending on the area.

There are two types of fat in the human body: subcutaneous fat and visceral fat.

Subcutaneous fat is the fat located between the skin and muscles, while visceral fat is the fat that is attached to the organs.

The body fat referred to in dieting is talking about visceral fat.

The fat cells mentioned in the video about the unfairness of starvation diets refer to visceral fat cells.

It has been reported that the number of visceral fat cells can decrease.

Because when comparing someone who lost weight quickly to someone who lost weight slowly,

In the case of someone who has lost weight quickly, it is common to experience a rebound effect.

People who lose weight slowly are less likely to experience yo-yo dieting.

There is a claim that this phenomenon occurs due to the number of fat cells.

Fat cells require a certain amount of time to die.

If you lose weight too quickly, the rate of fat cell death cannot keep up.

If this happens, since fat cells remain, it can easily lead to weight regain.

On the contrary, you can lose weight slowly in accordance with the rate at which fat cells die.

Or if you quickly lose weight and maintain that weight for a long time until the fat cells die,

This means that the number of fat cells has decreased, so yo-yo dieting does not occur.

The set point theory, which suggests that there is a weight that my body remembers, can also be explained by this.

I will summarize.

In the 1900s, there was a theory that the number of fat cells in adults does not change.

The theory was disproven in experiments conducted in the 2000s.

To answer the part you are most curious about, it is possible to change a body type that tends to gain weight.

Sounds plausible, right?
