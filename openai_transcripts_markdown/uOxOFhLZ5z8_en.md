This is a video responding to questions about carbohydrates and Talmud that were posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

It seems that a lack of carbohydrates is affecting my hair. My hair is becoming thinner and falling out. Please tell me about hair loss.

When talking about carbohydrate intake, it's often referred to as low-carb.

There are relative low-carb and absolute low-carb diets.

Relative low-carb means reducing the carbohydrates that were previously consumed in excess to an appropriate level.

Absolute low-carb refers to either not consuming carbohydrates at all or limiting daily intake to 10-20 grams.

Among absolute low-carbohydrate diets, the representative diet is the ketogenic diet.

It is true that hair loss can occur as a symptom when following a ketogenic diet.

But the interesting fact is that

There are people who follow a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet, obtaining most of their daily calorie intake from carbohydrates.

These people also have symptoms of hair loss.

So, a diet low in carbohydrates can also lead to hair loss symptoms.

A diet high in carbohydrates is also said to be associated with hair loss symptoms.

In other words, the cause of hair loss is not a lack of carbohydrates, but rather that there are additional factors involved.

Hair is made of protein, so if there is a lack of protein, it is said that hair loss can occur.

Could it be that a lack of protein is the cause?

It's a story that has a good chance of being true.

In that case, let's consider fats and proteins, as well as carbohydrates and proteins together.

A diet that includes a lot of both fats and proteins is the ketogenic diet mentioned at the beginning of the video.

Since I eat a considerable amount of meat, my diet consists of a lot of fat and protein.

However, this diet was said to have symptoms of hair loss.

In other words, even if you consume a lot of both fat and protein, hair loss symptoms can still occur.

Second, among high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets that consume a lot of carbohydrates.

The diets I know of are vegetarian, whole food plant-based, and fruitarian.

All three of these diets prohibit meat consumption, so there are often cases of protein deficiency due to not eating meat.

In that case, the claim that hair loss occurs due to a lack of protein in a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet holds true.

I've heard that you can get enough protein from a vegetarian diet without eating meat.

It's a topic that always comes up whenever we talk about vegetarianism.

It is theoretically possible.

However, there is a condition that you have to eat 2 to 3 kg of vegetables every day.

If you can't eat that amount every day, you are lacking in protein.

There is a video I made in the past about vegetarianism and protein, and it explains it in detail.

There is a video link at the top right, so if you're curious, you can click and watch it.

I think it's a big leap to say that anyone can "eat" 2 to 3 kg of vegetables every day.

Let's assume that a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet is lacking in protein.

As mentioned earlier, the reason for hair loss on a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet is

"This can be explained by the fact that there is a lack of protein."

If we add protein here, will it prevent hair loss?

The diet method commonly referred to as "jeongseok" in Korea is

It involves following a low-calorie diet while also exercising.

The composition of this diet strictly limits fat intake in order to reduce calories.

To obtain the glycogen needed for exercise, carbohydrates are obtained from potatoes and sweet potatoes.

And the protein needed to build muscle is obtained through chicken breast.

And to eliminate hunger, I also eat a lot of salad.

So this diet means it's one that includes a lot of carbohydrates and protein.

However, this diet also shows symptoms of hair loss.

Since it's a low-calorie diet, could it be that the lack of calories is causing hair loss?

This is also a story with a lot of potential.

In a situation where you are consuming enough carbohydrates and proteins

What should I do to increase calories to prevent hair loss?

First of all, I will exclude protein because it is used as a building material for the body rather than for calorie supply.

Then what remains are carbohydrates and fats.

Carbohydrates are divided into refined carbohydrates and unrefined carbohydrates.

Unrefined carbohydrates like fruits and vegetables have very low calories, so

To meet all the calories your body needs, you have to eat an enormous amount.

Realistically, it's impossible to supply all the calories your body needs with just this.

If you consume refined carbohydrates, it is possible to supply the calories your body needs, but...

There is an issue of increased appetite and obesity due to fluctuations in blood sugar levels and problems with energy conversion.

In that case, what is the method to prevent hair loss by maintaining the intake of unrefined carbohydrates while supplying the body with the necessary calories?

There is nothing else but to eat more fat.

So in the end, it concludes that we need to eat carbohydrates, fats, and proteins all together.

And you can think of menstruation, which was mentioned in the question, as being similar to hair loss.

Many reviews of the ketogenic diet mention that menstrual flow has decreased.

Among the reviews of high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets, there are many comments stating that menstruation does not occur at all.

A low-calorie diet that reduces calorie intake can also lead to symptoms of irregular menstruation.

To summarize, menstruation and hair loss are related to the three nutrients: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

It is a symptom that appears if even one is not properly consumed.

I believe that consuming all three types of unrefined foods is the way to solve the problem.

Sounds plausible, right?
