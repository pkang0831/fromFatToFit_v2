Is coffee good or bad for dieting? - Part 1: Coffee and Dieting

The caffeine in coffee activates metabolism and promotes energy consumption, which helps with dieting.

The caffeine in coffee induces the secretion of stress hormones, and these stress hormones interfere with dieting.

Which one is correct?

Many people have been asking questions about coffee in the comments, so in this video, I will talk about coffee.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video, there are conflicting claims about coffee.

So there are people who know that coffee can help with dieting.

Some people are aware that coffee can interfere with dieting.

The reason for this difference is that the time zones used as a reference are different.

First, the claim that coffee helps with dieting.

This claim is based on the state of alertness provided by coffee.

The caffeine in coffee has a stimulating effect. You may have heard this often.

The caffeine in coffee increases the number of glucose levels in the blood.

This glucose has the effect of making the heart beat faster, allowing it to spread quickly throughout the body.

So when you drink coffee, your heart starts to race, your mind becomes sharper, and you feel more energized.

When you enter this awakened state, your metabolism becomes more active and energy consumption increases.

When energy consumption increases, body fat can decrease.

Exercising in an awakened state allows you to increase the intensity of your workout.

There are discussions about how caffeine in coffee can help with dieting.

So the interpretation that coffee helps with dieting is

It is interpreted based on the time period in which the awakening state occurred.

The claim that the second cup of coffee is not helpful for dieting.

This claim is interpreted based on the time frame after the state of alertness caused by caffeine in coffee has ended.

Caffeine in coffee has been said to increase the amount of glucose in the blood and make the heart beat faster.

To make the heart beat faster, additional energy must be expended.

To increase the amount of glucose in the blood without food intake, additional energy must be expended.

The important thing here is that the energy consumed in this way is the energy stored in the body, which is drawn upon.

For example, what would happen if someone who can run 1 km slowly sprints?

Running at full speed will increase your speed, but you won't be able to run 1 km instead.

For example, let's assume that after sprinting for about 200 meters, you got tired and stopped.

To make it easier to understand, let's use some numbers to explain.

If this person expended 100 units of energy to run 1 km at a constant speed,

If you distribute 10 units of energy every 100 meters, you can run at a constant speed.

However, if you use 50 energy every 100 meters, then...

Even if you only run 200 meters, you use up all 100 of your energy, so you can't run anymore.

Instead, because I used 50 energy, I can run 100m much faster.

So, if you draw on the energy that you will use later and use it,

For now, you can exert a lot of power because you have a lot of energy, but...

This means that there will be a lack of energy afterwards.

The awakening effect caused by caffeine is the same.

The caffeine in coffee does not supply energy to our bodies.

It has an awakening effect that allows you to draw energy for later use, enabling you to exert strength instantly.

So in an awakened state, metabolism is active and energy consumption is high, but...

After the awakening state ends, it enters a state of energy deficiency.

If a person who can run 1 km sprints,

I can run 200 meters quickly, but after that, I get exhausted just the same.

When energy is lacking, the body experiences stress.

Due to this stress, the stress hormone cortisol is released.

Cortisol increases appetite and has the effect of making it easier for body fat to accumulate.

There are claims that coffee interferes with dieting.

So the claim that coffee helps with dieting is based on the state of being alert.

The claim that coffee interferes with dieting is based on the period after the state of alertness has ended.

It's not that one side is right and the other is wrong; rather, the reference points they are discussing are different.

So does drinking coffee help with dieting? Or does it not?

Simply put, just drinking coffee does not help with dieting.

In an awakened state, energy consumption increases, and because of that, body fat may decrease.

Once the state of awakening ends, the body will change to a state where body fat easily accumulates in order to restore the reduced body fat.

You can think of it as + - 0.

However, the situation changes when it comes to exercising.

Among the videos I made recently,

There is a video that says that body fat does not decrease due to calories burned from exercise.

If we starve ourselves or follow a low-calorie diet, we reduce the energy we consume.

Our bodies respond by lowering the metabolic rate to adjust to it.

It's about reducing energy consumption.

Similarly, when we exercise regularly, we continuously expend energy.

Our bodies also respond to this.

Since energy is continuously consumed through exercise, I try to replenish the energy that has been used.

Or you are trying to prepare the energy needed for exercise in advance.

Encouraging an increase in appetite to eat more food or

If you maintain the same meal quantity, one way to increase absorption is to try to absorb more energy from the same food.

Still, if you lack energy...

I try to keep my activity level extremely low outside of exercise to conserve energy.

When you actually exercise, the level of cortisol increases.

Cortisol increases appetite and makes it easier for the body to accumulate body fat.

And among those who combine exercise with a low-calorie diet,

I work out hard, but outside of my workout time, I just want to lie down and do nothing.

Alternatively, there are many people who feel drowsy often and sleep a lot.

So if you continuously burn calories through exercise,

Our bodies are adjusted to that.

You respond by somehow compensating for those calories or by preparing in advance.

That's why there's a saying that dieting is done through diet rather than exercise.

However, this is only from the perspective of visceral fat.

Body fat is divided into two types: visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is fat that is located right next to the organs, and it serves as a storage facility for energy, storing and supplying it.

Even if you burn calories through exercise, body fat does not decrease.

The body fat being referred to here is visceral fat.

On the other hand, since subcutaneous fat is located just beneath the skin,

The distance to the internal organs is very far, so it is difficult to use it for energy.

It serves the role of insulation to prevent the loss of body heat and acts as a shield to protect the body from external impacts.

However, just below this subcutaneous fat, there are muscles.

This muscle can generate heat and also serves to protect the body from external impacts.

When muscle mass increases and a lot of heat is generated in the muscles, body temperature rises.

To maintain a constant body temperature, elevated body heat must be released to the outside.

Subcutaneous fat has a warming effect, so it hinders the release of heat.

So, when muscle mass increases and activity levels rise, it results in a reduction of subcutaneous fat.

So, the calories burned through exercise do not reduce visceral fat, but...

If you build muscle through exercise, it means that subcutaneous fat can decrease.

In summary, drinking coffee causes the body to become alert due to caffeine.

In an awakened state, energy consumption increases, so this can help reduce visceral fat.

However, the reduced visceral fat will be restored after the state of arousal ends.

Drinking coffee does not reduce visceral fat.

However, if you utilize the state of arousal and increase the intensity of the exercise,

Because the intensity of the exercise has increased, muscle mass will increase.

Due to the increased muscle mass, there may be an effect of reducing subcutaneous fat.

You mentioned that drinking coffee leads to a state of alertness and increases the levels of glucose in the blood.

This means that blood sugar levels are rising, right?

When blood sugar levels rise, doesn't insulin get released and cause weight gain?

There are claims that drinking coffee is good for diabetes, as well as claims that coffee is bad for diabetes. Which one is correct?

In the next video, we will talk about coffee and blood sugar.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not about coffee and blood sugar, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making the video.

If you found this video helpful, please subscribe and like it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
