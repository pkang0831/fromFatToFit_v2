The meaning of the phrase "chew and eat food that we didn't know about"

Hello, this is pkang.

When eating food, you should chew it well. This is good for your health and also beneficial for dieting.

It's a well-known fact among many people regarding health and diet.

However, in a video I made previously,

I mentioned that artificially chewing food too much is not good for dieting.

The situation is that the common knowledge I previously had is conflicting with what I just said.

So there are many questions about this in the comments.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

In order for a person to live, various nutrients are needed.

When nutrients become insufficient, health problems will arise.

So, if we consider a situation where nutrients are lacking,

It is possible to say that consuming any nutrient can make you healthier.

For example, the video made right before this one is about basal metabolic rate.

Following a low-calorie diet for a long time can lead to a decrease in basal metabolic rate, resulting in deteriorating health.

If we base it on this situation,

Calorie-rich foods help prevent a decrease in basal metabolic rate, making them beneficial for health.

So it's possible to say that any food has health benefits.

In fact, Korean TV broadcasts often introduce food in this way.

The saying that chewing food well is good for health is based on this perspective.

The purpose of chewing food in the first place is to tear and break it down into smaller pieces.

Making it this small makes digestion and absorption easier.

A large chunk of ice melts slowly even when placed in water.

You can think of small crushed ice pieces as easily melting in water.

So, if you chew your food well, the nutrients in the food are absorbed well by your body.

The nutrients in such foods have health benefits, so chewing food well is good for your health.

Chewing food well is good for dieting.

The reason this story came about is due to the observations of how people eat.

There was a question in the past about whether the way we eat food might be related to obesity.

So, I observed and compared the eating habits of a number of overweight and slim individuals.

When I compared them, I found a clear difference in the number of times the food was chewed.

Overweight people tend to chew their food relatively fewer times before swallowing.

Slim people tend to chew and swallow their food relatively more times.

Because the differences between the two groups were clearly distinguished,

There is a growing awareness that the number of times food is chewed is related to obesity.

If you swallow food without chewing it properly, it can lead to obesity.

The claim that chewing food thoroughly is good for dieting has emerged.

However, there is one strange thing.

The reason why it is said that chewing food well is good for health is

You need to chew your food well so that the nutrients can be properly absorbed by your body.

However, the reason a person becomes obese is due to an excess of nutrients entering the body.

So if we connect these two ideas,

If you chew your food well, digestion and absorption become easier.

It is good for health, but excessive nutrition can lead to obesity.

On the contrary, if you do not chew your food well, it becomes difficult to digest and absorb.

It's not good for health, but it's good for dieting. This is how it connects.

So, chewing food well is good for health and can also be beneficial for dieting.

Eating a lot and chewing well is not good for dieting.

Eating less by chewing food less is not good for your health.

However, there was a difference in the number of times that overweight and slim people chewed their food.

If it has no effect on the diet, then why was there a difference in the number of times it was chewed?

It is because the types of food we eat are different.

For example, let's imagine eating steak and meatballs.

Cut the steak into appropriate sizes and put it in your mouth.

You have to keep chewing until it becomes small enough.

However, meatballs are a dish made by combining ground meat.

It will dissolve completely after just a few chews in your mouth.

I talked about how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods in the video.

Food made by grinding, chopping, or crushing.

It was said that because digestion and absorption happen too quickly, it becomes food that makes you gain weight.

In fact, compared to white rice that still retains its original form,

Noodles and bread made from ground wheat flour are more fattening foods.

So, overweight people have become obese because they primarily eat fattening foods that are ground, crushed, and processed.

Foods like this don't require much chewing.

When observing the way food was eaten, it was evident that it was being consumed without proper chewing.

Slim people tend to eat unprocessed foods, which is why they are slim.

Unprocessed food has to be chewed a lot more.

When I observed the way they ate, they showed a lot of chewing.

So, it's not that slim people are slim because they chew their food a lot.

I was slim because I ate unprocessed foods that required a lot of chewing.

On the contrary, a fat person is not fat because they chew their food less.

I got fat because I ate processed foods that didn't require much chewing.

I will summarize.

When eating food, you should chew it well. This is good for your health and also beneficial for dieting.

Many people focus on the number of times they chew because of this story.

It's not the number of times you chew that matters, but the type of food you eat.

It's not that you have to chew your food a lot.

You need to eat foods that require a lot of chewing.

Unprocessed, unrefined food is chewy enough that I don't need to want it.

If you are eating unrefined foods, don't worry too much about how many times you chew; just enjoy your meal comfortably.

Eating food thoroughly makes you eat slowly, and it is said that eating slowly is good for dieting.

Is it okay to eat food slowly?

In the next video, I will talk about this question.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not about the speed of eating, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making the video.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
