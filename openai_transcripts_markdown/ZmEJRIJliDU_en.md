How effective is wearing a sweat suit for losing body fat?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

Please let me know if sweat suits have any effect on dieting, as I've seen many comments about this.

In this video, I would like to talk about sweat suits.

I heard that sweat suits don't have any effect on dieting?

Just because you sweat doesn't mean that body fat decreases more.

Yes, that's right.

However, the questions that have been posted in the comments of my video are slightly different from the typical questions about sweat suits.

It's a question about sweat suits and subcutaneous fat.

The body fat in our body can be broadly divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat that is located right next to the internal organs.

Because it is close to the internal organs, it has the characteristic of being easily usable as energy.

So when you adjust your diet, it effectively reduces fat.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is the fat located just beneath the skin.

It is spread throughout the body and is far from the internal organs.

It is difficult to use as energy.

Instead, since it is on the outermost part of the body, except for the skin.

It has the characteristic of protecting the body from external shocks and preventing the loss of body heat.

So when you exercise and increase your activity level, it effectively reduces fat.

Because a person needs to use muscles to move.

When muscles are used, heat is generated, causing an increase in body temperature.

Humans are warm-blooded animals, which means that their body temperature must be maintained at a constant level.

When heat is generated in the body and the body temperature rises, that heat must be released outside the body.

However, the subcutaneous fat covering the muscles has a warming effect, which interferes with this.

So, as more heat is generated in the body, subcutaneous fat hinders the maintenance of body temperature and thus decreases.

It is said that by exercising to increase muscle mass and activity level, body fat will decrease.

Finally, the story of the sweat suit comes up.

The body temperature rises due to heat generated within the body.

If the reduction of body fat hinders lowering that body temperature, then...

If you wear a sweat suit and maintain a high body temperature, can that lead to the loss of subcutaneous fat?

This is a question that appears in the comments of my video.

To put it simply, let's start with the conclusion.

Wearing a sweat suit does not mean that body fat will burn off more effectively.

Because the heat inside the body and the heat outside the body are different.

For example, let's assume we are in a hot place. The body is in a situation where there is heat outside.

Being in a hot place raises the temperature of the skin, causing sweating.

Liquid sweat evaporates into gas, taking heat from the surrounding environment in the process.

So, as the sweat on the skin evaporates, it takes away the heat from the skin.

The skin loses heat, so the temperature decreases.

This is the process by which body temperature is regulated through sweat.

This is why we sweat when we are hot.

In this process, body fat has no relevance.

The skin became hot from external heat, but it just cooled down by sweating.

However, the heat inside the body is a different story.

When heat is generated inside the body, in the muscles,

Since heat is generated in the body, the body temperature rises.

To lower body temperature, heat from the muscles must be transferred to the skin.

You need to sweat on your skin to evaporate the sweat and carry away the heat.

However, subcutaneous fat is blocking the space between the muscles and the skin.

Moreover, this subcutaneous fat has insulating properties.

The more subcutaneous fat there is, the harder it is for the heat from the muscles to be transferred to the skin.

It is necessary for subcutaneous fat to decrease in order to regulate body temperature.

So, heat needs to be generated from inside rather than from the subcutaneous fat in order to effectively reduce subcutaneous fat.

Let's remember up to this point and think about the sweat suit.

Does a sweat suit have the effect of generating heat from within rather than from subcutaneous fat?

That's not the case.

So, sweat suits do not have the effect of reducing body fat.

I understand that sweat suits do not generate heat from within as effectively as body fat does.

Anyway, a sweat suit has the effect of raising body temperature.

In that case, wouldn't the subcutaneous fat decrease in order to lower the body temperature?

It does not decrease.

When the heat generated by the muscles raises the body temperature, it needs to be expelled from the body.

Subcutaneous fat with insulating properties interferes with this.

As I talk about connecting body temperature and subcutaneous fat,

Just as one might misunderstand that subcutaneous fat has a direct impact on body temperature.

So when body fat decreases, body temperature drops.

To lower an elevated body temperature, it is necessary to reduce subcutaneous fat.

I think in this way.

Subcutaneous fat does not raise or lower body temperature.

Raising body temperature is the heat generated by the muscles, and

Lowering body temperature is the sweat that evaporates from the skin.

Heat is being generated inside the body due to the muscles.

The sweat suit prevents sweat from evaporating, so the heat from the skin does not escape.

In a state where both the inside and outside of the body are hot like this,

Does reducing subcutaneous fat lower body temperature?

No.

If heat continues to be generated in the muscles, the body will remain hot.

If you don't take off the sweat suit to allow the sweat to evaporate, your skin will continue to feel hot.

So, in order to lower body temperature,

Preventing heat from being generated in the muscles any further.

You need to take off the sweat suit to let the sweat evaporate or sweat even more.

It has nothing to do with reducing subcutaneous fat.

In reality, wearing a sweat suit makes you sweat more and makes it harder to move because of the heat.

The reason for sweating more is a response to lower the heat of the skin.

The reason it becomes difficult to move the body is

It is to prevent the use of muscles so that heat is no longer generated inside the body.

Again, just wearing a sweat suit doesn't mean that body fat will burn off.

In fact, wearing a sweat suit can hinder the loss of body fat.

Heat is generated in the muscles.

The heat is transferred to the skin.

It allows sweat to evaporate from the skin, taking heat away.

This process needs to work properly.

Even if heat continues to be generated in the muscles, it is possible to maintain a constant body temperature.

You must be able to maintain a constant body temperature, so that even if your muscles continuously generate heat, there will be no problem.

Muscles need to continuously generate heat, but subcutaneous fat keeps interfering with the transfer of that heat to the skin.

Subcutaneous fat must continue to be a hindrance for subcutaneous fat to be lost.

So, the temperature regulation function is working properly.

There should be no problem in continuously generating heat in the muscles in order to lose subcutaneous fat.

However, a sweat suit interferes with this process.

A sweat suit is clothing that prevents the evaporation of sweat.

So wearing a sweat suit cannot lower the skin temperature.

In this case, it won't be possible to lower the body temperature.

We need to prevent the muscles from generating heat so that the body temperature does not rise any further.

If heat is not generated in the muscles, there will be no heat transferred to the skin.

If there is no heat transmitted to the skin, then the subcutaneous fat wouldn't be a hindrance either.

Then there is no reason for body fat to decrease.

So to summarize,

To reduce body fat, you need to increase your activity level and exercise amount.

However, wearing a sweat suit makes it hard to exercise because it's hot, and it's also difficult to move my body.

So, the amount of exercise and activity has decreased. As a result, body fat is not being lost.

This is how it turns out.

To reduce body fat, you need to exercise and move your body.

Wearing a sweat suit or something like that.

Moving to a hot area.

Even in the middle of summer, they turn on the boiler to live comfortably warm.

Applying a heating device or hot pack to the abdomen.

Hitting or pinching to induce fever.

None of this is helpful at all.

To lose body fat, you need to exercise and move your body.

I understand that when you make your body hot with a sweat suit, it doesn't have any effect.

What if you make your body cold instead?

I remember seeing on TV that you lose weight when it's cold.

There is research indicating that body fat decreases when exposed to cold environments continuously.

Based on that research, there was a lot of talk on TV about the idea that you lose weight when it's cold.

However, this method is not very effective.

There was a similar question in the past, so I made a response video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will set it up so that a video about cold environments appears in the top left.

When heat is generated in the muscles through exercise, body temperature rises.

To lower body temperature, the heat from the muscles is transferred to the skin, but subcutaneous fat interferes with this process.

If the subcutaneous fat decreases because of that,

If I work hard on my abdominal exercises and generate a lot of heat in my abs, does that mean I will lose belly fat?

I've heard that doing abdominal exercises doesn't actually help lose belly fat.

The difference depends on the type of abdominal exercise you do.

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure to have videos about spot reduction for different areas available in the top right.

Why abdominal exercises don't lead to fat loss in the belly.

What type of exercise is effective?

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

One way to reduce subcutaneous fat is through liposuction.

Can liposuction help with dieting?

No, that's not correct. Liposuction is not a substitute for dieting.

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a related video.

I will make sure to have a video about liposuction in the bottom left corner.
