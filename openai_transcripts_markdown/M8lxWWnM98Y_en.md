Why am I not slim even though I exercise regularly? - Part 4 on Calories

This is the fourth video about calories.

In the first video, I talked about the fundamental errors of the calorie diet theory.

In the second video, there is a tribe that lives by hunting and gathering.

We talked about the reason why the daily metabolic rate of modern people working in office jobs is the same.

Looking at the content of the first and second videos, it seems that exercise may not be helpful for dieting.

There are people who have lost weight solely through exercise without any diet.

I talked about how that is possible in the third video.

To summarize the content of the third video briefly,

The human body continuously changes to adapt to the environment.

If you create an environment that encourages consistent exercise,

The body changes to allow for more efficient exercise.

They said that you would lose weight in the process.

However, at the end of the third video, this question came up.

There is a lady in our neighborhood's swimming pool who has been consistently going to the pool for several years.

I have a slightly chubby figure.

When you exercise consistently, your body changes efficiently.

Shouldn't that lady have a slim figure?

That's an interesting question, isn't it?

In this video, I will talk about this.

First of all, I have been swimming for a long time, but there are many different reasons for my plump figure.

As someone commented in the last video,

I consistently went to the swimming pool, but it's possible that I was just playing in the water rather than exercising.

Due to the nature of swimming, which involves exercising in water, there are also issues related to heat loss.

What are the problems caused by heat loss?

I talked about it in the subcutaneous fat series.

The body fat in a person's body is divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat located right next to the organs, and it serves as an energy storage.

When visceral fat increases, one characteristic is that the belly protrudes like a balloon.

When we adjust our diet, the fat that primarily decreases is visceral fat.

Subcutaneous fat is the fat located just beneath the skin.

It is fat that protects the body from external shocks or prevents heat loss.

The flabby flesh that we commonly refer to as skin that we can touch with our hands corresponds to this.

When you increase muscle mass through exercise, it effectively reduces fat.

Humans are warm-blooded animals that need to maintain a body temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius.

The water temperature of the swimming pool is not below 36.5 degrees.

So when you are in the water, you continuously lose body heat.

In this case, the need for subcutaneous fat will increase in order to maintain body temperature.

So, is it not possible to lose weight through swimming?

Swimming alone is definitely not effective for dieting. That's not the case.

Choose a swimming pool with a high water temperature.

When I got into the water, I swam hard.

When you take a break, coming out of the water to maintain your body temperature can also help with dieting.

However, the water temperature in the pool is low, and I swim leisurely as if I'm just playing in the water.

Resting in the water without swimming is not good for dieting.

The difference between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat, and how to reduce subcutaneous fat.

I explained it in detail in the subcutaneous fat series.

If you are curious about the related information, you can click the link in the upper right corner to view it.

As a reference, when talking about subcutaneous fat, there is always a question that comes up.

If you work hard on your abdominal exercises and generate heat in your stomach, will it help reduce belly fat?

Does living in a hot environment help reduce body fat?

Does living in a cold environment increase body fat? This is the type of question.

There are answer videos for the entire series, so if you're curious about the related content, please refer to them.

Returning to the original story.

There is that possibility, but...

The theme of this series is the relationship between calories burned through exercise and dieting.

I am swimming hard, and let's assume there are no issues with my body temperature.

If you consistently practice swimming hard, your body will adapt to be more suitable for swimming.

Why can't I achieve a slim figure?

It is because the exercise I am currently doing and my current body are in balance.

It's a bit difficult to understand with swimming, but if you think about walking exercises, it becomes easier to understand.

A person with severe obesity who has no prior exercise experience starts walking for exercise.

Even walking a little makes me out of breath, and my legs hurt so much that it's hard to walk.

As your weight decreases and your cardiovascular capacity and muscles develop, it becomes easier to engage in walking exercises.

So even if the weight is heavy,

The lower body muscles that support that weight are sufficiently developed.

When the heart and lungs, which supply the necessary oxygen and blood to the lower body muscles, are sufficiently developed,

There is no problem with doing walking exercises.

And if this happens, even if you keep walking, you won't lose weight, right?

The lady at the swimming pool is the same way.

If the current body is recognized as being in a sufficiently efficient state for swimming,

The body won't change any further from here.

So, a body that is efficient for exercising means that...

It means that it's not just about having a slim body unconditionally.

The type and intensity of the exercise I am currently doing, and when compared to my physical abilities.

If it is suitable for that exercise, then it has become an efficient state.

If you want to achieve more weight loss effects through exercise here,

You need to change the type of exercise or increase the intensity of your workout.

Changing the type of exercise will cause the body to adapt and change accordingly.

When the intensity of exercise increases, the body changes because the intensity of the exercise has increased.

In short, if you engage in various exercises and gradually increase the intensity, you will lose weight.

On the contrary, if you continue the same exercise at the same intensity, it means that you will gradually stop losing weight.

Many people exercise for the purpose of dieting, but

It is common to repeat the same exercise at the same intensity.

Since it's said that you have to exercise to diet, it's a case of doing it out of obligation.

And this is one of the reasons why I feel that there is no effect from my diet, even though I continue to exercise consistently.

You shouldn't increase the intensity of your exercise so quickly that it makes you not want to work out.

If the exercise you are currently doing no longer provides any stimulation,

Please try changing the type of exercise or increasing the intensity of your workout.

Then you can also achieve the effect of losing weight.
