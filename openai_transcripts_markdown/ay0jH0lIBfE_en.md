Understanding the Most Fattening Foods and Diet Plans in the World - Appetite Part 2

All videos have subtitles.

If you can't see the subtitles, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about how refined carbohydrates increase appetite.

In this video, I would like to talk about refined fats.

First, let's briefly go over what refined fat is.

The oil we use can be considered as refined fat.

In the first part of the video, we will show how processing allows us to eat more of what we couldn't eat much of before.

It was said that something that is slowly digested and absorbed is processed quickly, which is referred to as refined.

Basically, the oils we use are

It is a plant-based oil made by extracting fat from plant-based foods such as beans, olives, and avocados.

It's animal fat made by extracting only the fat from animal products like pork, similar to lard.

Since it is collected by extracting only the fat separately,

It is easy to consume a large amount, and it is absorbed by the body very quickly.

So the oil we use is basically all refined fat.

Eating a lot of refined carbohydrates can lead to problems.

Consuming a lot of refined fats can lead to problems.

When using oil, it is important to be careful not to use too much.

In Part 1 of the video, it was mentioned that consuming refined carbohydrates causes blood sugar levels to rise quickly and significantly.

When blood sugar rises quickly and significantly, insulin is secreted to lower this blood sugar.

When blood sugar levels drop due to insulin, it creates a craving for sweet foods because of the fluctuation in blood sugar levels.

However, insulin does not only lower blood sugar levels.

It also stores fat as body fat.

And this also has the effect of increasing appetite.

The reason we eat food is to obtain energy from it in order to live.

The largest source of energy that can be obtained from food is fat.

Insulin is responsible for storing fat as body fat.

If too much insulin is produced,

The fat I eat gets stored as body fat too much.

In this case, there will be a shortage of energy available for immediate use.

I ate food to gain energy and use it.

Too much energy has been stored as body fat.

Because of the lack of energy, our bodies will demand food again.

So, you often feel like eating, and this is what increases your appetite.

If too much is stored as body fat, can't we just take out the body fat and use it?

Yes, that's right.

However, body fat is fundamentally recognized as emergency reserves.

It does not use body fat first.

First, let's send a hunger signal.

Even if you do that, if food doesn't come in, then your body will use fat.

First, I send out hunger signals because of this.

Even if we eat enough food, our appetite rises again after 3 or 4 hours, making us feel hungry.

The appetite caused by blood sugar fluctuations mentioned in Part 1 of the video is

The goal is to raise blood sugar levels.

I'm full, but I want to eat something sweet. It appears in this form, though.

The appetite that arises from storing too much energy as body fat is

The goal is to obtain energy.

In reality, when you are hungry, it manifests as a desire to eat high-calorie foods.

This is where it gets a bit interesting.

When you consume refined carbohydrates, your blood sugar levels rise.

Insulin is released to lower blood sugar levels.

Insulin lowers blood sugar by storing glucose in the blood as body fat.

Because of this story

A large amount of glucose is stored as body fat.

So, many people think that this leads to obesity.

In reality, such cases are very rare.

Because carbohydrates, which are the raw materials for glucose, provide 4 kcal per gram.

Fat has 9 kcal per gram, so the calorie difference is more than double.

To lower blood sugar, even if glucose is stored as body fat.

The amount is not that large.

So it's not easy to convert glucose into body fat and become obese.

Then, what causes the accumulation of excess body fat to the point of obesity?

Refined fats are stored as body fat with the help of insulin.

Oh? So refined fats are the problem, not refined carbohydrates?

But why is refined carbohydrates considered a problem?

Even refined fats do not significantly stimulate insulin.

Refined carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels, leading to increased insulin production.

Due to fluctuations in blood sugar levels, there may be a tendency to crave sweet foods frequently.

Every time you eat refined carbohydrates, insulin is released frequently and in large amounts.

However, insulin is responsible for storing glucose as body fat or storing fat as body fat.

It is a hormone that primarily works to increase body fat.

So, in situations where insulin is released, hormones that reduce body fat do not come out.

So, while body fat doesn't increase, there is an effect that prevents body fat from decreasing.

In summary, I often want to eat sweet foods.

Make insulin release frequently.

It prevents the reduction of body fat.

These three are the issues with refined carbohydrates.

Refined fats do not stimulate insulin.

In situations with high insulin levels, it can significantly increase body fat and lead to obesity.

And in such situations,

It makes you want to eat a lot of greasy and high-calorie foods.

There is a problem like this.

So if you combine refined carbohydrates and refined fats,

You start to crave sweet foods and high-calorie foods often.

Every time I eat that kind of food, a lot of insulin is released.

While preventing the reduction of body fat, it leads to a significant increase in body fat, resulting in obesity.

In short, foods like ice cream, snacks, and cake are the most fattening foods in the world.

However, if you turn this around, two questions arise.

First question

Eating refined carbohydrates makes me crave sweet foods often.

So even if insulin is released frequently and it hinders the reduction of body fat,

In the end, if you don't eat fat, doesn't that mean body fat won't increase?

So, I can't lose weight because my body fat reduction is being hindered, but...

It's not that I'm gaining weight, that's what I think.

Then, as long as you succeed in dieting by any means,

From then on, if I don't eat fat, isn't it okay to eat a lot of refined carbohydrates?

The second question.

Refined fats can lead to a significant amount of body fat, and because of this, there is a possibility of obesity.

This is based on a situation where insulin is present.

However, refined fats do not stimulate insulin.

If you don't eat carbohydrates, then insulin won't be released.

Even if you consume a lot of refined fats, it won't necessarily be stored as body fat.

Therefore, one does not become obese.

Additionally, when insulin that increases body fat is released,

The hormone that reduces body fat is not being released.

If you don't eat carbohydrates, insulin will not be released.

If insulin is not released, a hormone that reduces fat will be produced.

Isn't it possible to lose weight even if you eat a lot of fat?

It's fun, isn't it?

The diet created from the first question is

It is a diet that allows the intake of refined carbohydrates but strictly limits fats.

The diet created from the second question is

The intake of refined fats is allowed without restriction, but the diet strictly limits carbohydrates.

In that case, which of the two diets is better?

In conclusion, neither of them is a good diet.

This is because a diet that allows the intake of refined carbohydrates but strictly limits fats is...

Anyway, eating refined carbohydrates raises blood sugar levels.

To lower blood sugar, insulin is released.

Because of the drop in blood sugar, I want to eat sweet foods again.

Eating sweet foods still triggers the same issue of insulin being released.

There is a problem where insulin is secreted too frequently and in excessive amounts.

This can lead to issues with insulin resistance.

The more frequently and abundantly insulin, which has the effect of increasing body fat, is secreted,

The hormone that helps reduce fat doesn't have a chance to be released, so dieting isn't going well.

A diet that allows the intake of refined fats but strictly limits carbohydrates.

In the case of this diet,

To prevent insulin from being released, carbohydrates are restricted.

Insulin does not only respond to carbohydrates; it also reacts to proteins.

So even if you don't eat carbohydrates, consuming protein will still trigger insulin release.

In situations where insulin is released

When you consume a lot of refined fats, your body fat tends to increase significantly.

In the initial phase of the diet, the restriction of carbohydrates does lead to some weight loss.

Over time, the effects of dieting can diminish, or you may even end up gaining weight.

To avoid problems even when consuming a lot of refined fats,

You need to reduce not only carbohydrates but also protein.

In this case, the only food that can be eaten is fat.

You cannot create a diet by only eating fat.

And this will be a major health issue.

So, while I eat refined foods, a diet that restricts other nutrients is...

Because problems arise in some form.

Structuring a diet like this from the beginning is not a very good approach.

So what should you do? You just need to avoid eating processed foods.

What exactly is processed food?

Food that could not be eaten in large quantities has been processed to be able to eat more of it.

It refers to foods that are processed to allow for faster digestion and absorption compared to foods that are slow to digest and absorb.

A typical example is flour made by grinding wheat.

There are processed meats made by grinding or chopping meat.

This is the basic concept, but...

If you only listen up to this point, you will have many questions about the detailed parts.

Tofu is made by grinding soybeans. Is tofu also a processed food?

Does eating tofu make you gain weight?

Sweet potatoes are known for being a popular diet food, and they haven't been grated, chopped, or ground.

Some people gain weight from eating sweet potatoes.

Why is this person like that?

Fruits are said to have a high glycemic index, which can lead to weight gain. What about fruits?

This question was covered in detail in the series on fattening foods that I created in the past.

I would like to hear more details about refined foods.

Those people can check the series link that is currently displayed in the top right corner.

In the next video, let's talk about refined protein.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the appetite series,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
