There was a question in the comments about the first meal after the fasting period in intermittent fasting and its relation to insulin.

To discuss the question, we need to understand the process of how we become obese.

The reason we become obese is that we eat too often and too much.

When we eat food, the nutrients from that food enter our bodies.

The hormone that handles this nutrient is insulin.

If we eat food often and in large quantities, nutrients will frequently and abundantly enter our bodies.

To handle this, insulin will also be needed frequently and in larger amounts.

One of the functions of insulin is to increase body fat.

When insulin is released frequently and in large amounts, body fat tends to accumulate frequently and in large quantities.

And if the situation where insulin is frequently and abundantly released continues to repeat,

The response to this insulin gradually weakens.

For example, if you eat sweet snacks and get used to that taste,

In foods that are less sweet than that snack, you won't be able to taste the sweetness.

To experience sweetness, foods that are sweeter than snacks are needed.

When insulin is released frequently and in large amounts in the same context, our body adapts to that situation.

So, when doing the same work, more insulin is needed.

Because it does not respond to insulin and is resistant to it, more insulin is needed.

This is called insulin resistance.

When insulin resistance increases, more insulin is needed to perform the same tasks.

More insulin makes us more obese.

So in dieting, it is important to improve insulin resistance.

To reduce the amount of insulin released when consuming the same quantity of food.

To prevent insulin resistance from occurring again, we need to ensure that insulin is not released frequently or in large amounts.

In intermittent fasting, there are fasting periods during which no food is consumed.

Create a situation where insulin is not released.

I am trying to improve insulin resistance through this.

After the fasting period ends, the first food consumed can sometimes trigger a significant release of insulin.

To improve insulin resistance, which results in higher insulin levels when consuming the same amount of food.

It is a fasting period during which no food is consumed.

It's strange that a lot of insulin is released during the first meal after fasting, isn't it?

There was a comment asking why this is happening, so I would like to talk about it.

I heard that after the fasting period ends, the first food you eat should be something that doesn't raise your blood sugar. Is that correct?

There are quite a few such stories, but the narrative is a bit tangled.

When blood sugar levels rise, a lot of insulin is released. Because of this story,

If a lot of insulin is released, it must be because blood sugar levels are high. Think of it this way.

So if a lot of insulin is released during the first meal after fasting,

You start to think that the meal must have included foods that significantly raise blood sugar levels.

So, I'm saying to eat foods that don't raise blood sugar too much.

In fact, even if you eat foods that do not significantly raise blood sugar levels,

In some cases, a significant amount of insulin is released during the first meal after fasting.

If a lot of insulin is released when blood sugar levels are high,

I know that glucose in the blood is stored as body fat, which is why we gain weight.

If blood sugar levels are not high, isn't it okay for a lot of insulin to be released?

It is true that insulin is responsible for storing glucose in the blood as body fat.

Insulin also plays a role in storing the fats we eat as body fat.

While insulin, which carries out the command to store body fat, is being released,

Because glucagon, which carries out the command to burn body fat, is not released.

There is also the issue that body fat is not being burned.

So even if the blood sugar is not high,

In situations where insulin levels are high, body fat increases and body fat is not consumed.

It's not good for dieting.

But why is there a lot of insulin released during the first meal after the fasting period ends?

This is a response to restore the body fat that was forced to be used.

There are two main ways to reduce body fat in a diet.

The first is to force the body to use body fat.

The second is to induce the body to eliminate unnecessary body fat.

For example, if you eat less food, you will lack energy, so you will have no choice but to use body fat.

If you expend a lot of energy through exercise, you'll end up lacking energy, so you'll have no choice but to use body fat.

When exposed to a cold environment, the body will have no choice but to use body fat to maintain its temperature.

These methods correspond to the first method.

However, from the body's perspective, body fat is emergency food.

A situation that forces the use of this emergency food is one where emergency food is absolutely necessary.

In reality, when you eat less food, expend a lot of energy through exercise, or are exposed to cold environments,

If there had been no emergency food source like body fat, life would have been in danger.

In situations like that, the body thinks, "Yes! I really needed emergency rations!"

I am trying to stock up on emergency supplies.

Of course, such situations are all intended to use body fat for dieting purposes, but

Our body knows nothing of that at all.

I'm just faithfully following the instinct to survive, no matter what.

If you actually follow a low-calorie diet and eat less food,

Following a low-calorie diet can lead to a decrease in basal metabolic rate.

If you stop following a low-calorie diet because of this, you will experience a yo-yo effect.

If you increase the calories burned through exercise,

Our bodies prepare the necessary calories in advance according to the situation of exercise.

If you stop exercising because of this, you may gain weight.

It is true that when exposed to a cold environment, body fat decreases in order to maintain body temperature.

Because of this, there was a trend for a while with diet tips and articles saying that winter is a good time for dieting.

This was a phenomenon that appeared only in the short term.

As time passed, it was revealed that all the body fat consumed would be restored.

Now, all the tips and articles saying that winter is a good time for dieting have disappeared.

The reason why a lot of insulin is released during the first meal after fasting is the same.

If you do not eat during the fasting period, insulin will not be released.

If insulin is not released, glucagon, which has the opposite effect, will be released.

What glucagon does is reduce body fat.

Therefore, when the fasting period is extended, our body starts to use body fat.

However, intentionally having a long fasting period forces the body to use fat for energy.

From the body's perspective, since I am not eating right now, I have no choice but to use body fat.

The body will respond by trying to restore the body fat that has been used.

So when I had my first meal after the fasting ended,

Insulin is being released in large amounts, trying to restore the body fat that was used.

So whether you eat foods that raise blood sugar or not, insulin will be produced in large amounts.

If insulin levels are high, body fat will increase.

Until intermittent fasting became popular,

I have seen that excessively long fasting periods without eating can be a cause of obesity.

Therefore, the prevailing opinion was that in order to diet, one must definitely eat breakfast.

Taking it a step further, if the fasting period is long, a lot of insulin is released during the next meal, which can lead to obesity.

It was also recommended to intentionally eat frequently to shorten the fasting period.

It was a method of dividing three meals into 5 to 6 portions and eating a little bit frequently.

As these methods were introduced on TV broadcasts, many people tried them.

In fact, there are many people who have successfully lost weight.

So, does that mean intermittent fasting is ineffective?

No, that's not the case.

It's not that intermittent fasting is ineffective, but rather that there is an issue with the way it is being practiced.

The essence of intermittent fasting is that the problem lies in eating too often and too much.

It is to have fasting periods so that you don't eat too often or too much.

So it's not about reducing meal portions by having fasting periods to lose weight.

The purpose is to take fasting periods to avoid overeating.

If you make use of fasting periods and do not eat frequently or in large amounts,

Body fat will no longer increase, and insulin resistance will improve.

After that, during mealtime, I ate enough food.

The body doesn't need to store body fat like this, so it's encouraging you to get rid of it.

If you utilize fasting time in this way,

There is no issue with a high release of insulin during the first meal after the fasting period ends.

In fact, if you don't eat anything from the time dinner ends the night before until the next morning,

Since there is sleep time, I have quite a long fasting period.

As mentioned earlier, a person who didn't eat breakfast will lose weight if they start eating breakfast.

So, having a fasting period itself is not the problem.

The problem is that having a fasting period that is too long for me doesn't suit me.

The unfortunate thing is that most information about intermittent fasting is overly focused on the fasting hours alone.

So, I think you should stick to a 16-hour fast without exception.

Or, the longer the fasting period, the more people think it is good for dieting.

When the weight loss effects of intermittent fasting diminish, I plan to extend the fasting period.

The fasting period is too long, so a lot of insulin is released during the first meal after fasting.

Because of that, the effectiveness of my diet is decreasing.

If you extend the fasting period, it won't solve the problem; it will only worsen it.

Since the fasting time has increased, the amount of food intake will decrease even more.

Since my food intake has decreased, I am losing weight a bit more.

Both starvation diets and low-calorie diets result in weight loss in the beginning.

Since I'm not losing weight in the first place, I plan to extend the fasting period.

It's just that the expression was made during fasting hours; it's the same as saying I will fast longer.

This means that one can no longer distinguish between intermittent fasting and a low-calorie diet.

In reality, as long as there is a fasting period, eating only 500 calories a day is not considered a low-calorie diet.

There are quite a few cases where such claims are made.

Whether you have fasting hours or not, consuming only 500 calories a day is indeed a low-calorie diet.

Among those who are on a low-calorie diet of 500 calories from the beginning,

For example, consuming 50 calories every hour over a span of 10 hours would total 500 calories.

No one eats 500 calories over the course of 5 hours at a rate of 100 calories every hour.

Eat 500 calories at once and then fast for the rest of the time.

I eat only twice, dividing my meals into 200 to 300 calories each, and I fast for the rest of the time.

So in actual behavior, there is no difference from intermittent fasting.

Doing the same thing.

If you label that behavior as a low-calorie diet, your basal metabolic rate will decrease, leading to a yo-yo effect.

It's strange to say that there is no problem just because it's called intermittent fasting.

If you do the same actions from the beginning, it is natural that you will get the same results.

So what exactly should I do?

We need to move away from the approach that forces the use of body fat.

Those who are suited for a 16-hour fast can continue with it.

Those for whom a 16-hour fast is not suitable should find a fasting duration that works for them.

For some people, fasting for less than 16 hours can also be effective.

When you eat food, insulin is released, and if insulin is released, doesn't that mean you can't lose weight?

So if the fasting time is shortened, it seems like I won't lose weight.

Many people misunderstand that when you eat food, insulin is released.

It means that when insulin is released, dieting becomes ineffective.

Just because you ate food doesn't mean that the same amount of insulin is always released.

The amount of insulin released varies depending on what food you eat and how much of it you consume.

If the same amount of insulin is always released, regardless of the type and quantity of food consumed,

When you eat a lot of food, a lot of insulin is released.

The idea that it leads to obesity doesn't hold up.

So just because the fasting period is short, it doesn't mean that you can't diet at all.

In a moment, two videos will appear on the screen.
