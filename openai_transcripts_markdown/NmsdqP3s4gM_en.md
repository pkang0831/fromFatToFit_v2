Will living in a hot environment help reduce body fat?

There is a series on body fat that I made in a previous video.

In that video, we talked about the differences between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat located right next to the organs, which has the characteristic of being easily utilized for energy.

So when you adjust your diet, it effectively reduces fat, but...

Subcutaneous fat is located just beneath the skin, so it is far from the internal organs.

So it is fat that is difficult to utilize for energy.

Instead, it is located relatively on the outside of the body.

It is fat that protects the body from external shocks and prevents the loss of body heat.

If you exercise to increase muscle mass and use your muscles,

A large amount of heat is generated in the muscles.

To maintain body temperature, you need to release this heat outside of your body.

However, the insulating ability of subcutaneous fat interferes with this.

When you exercise, your body feels the need to reduce body fat.

So, it was said that subcutaneous fat is the type of fat that burns more effectively when you exercise.

Since that video was made, there have been two questions that keep coming up consistently.

If you work hard on abdominal exercises and generate heat in your abdomen, will the subcutaneous fat in your abdomen decrease?

I've heard that spot reduction for weight loss isn't possible. Do you think it is?

Does going to the sauna often or wearing extra clothes in the summer help reduce body fat?

Both are interesting questions.

First, regarding the first question, a response video has already been produced.

The link is at the top right, so if you're curious, you can click on it to take a look.

In this video, I will talk about the second question.

Does living in a hot environment help reduce body fat?

To put it simply, that's not the case.

It is due to the difference between heat generated inside the body and heat generated outside the body.

To understand this, you need to know about sweat.

When our body gets warmer, we start to sweat.

This sweat evaporates, taking heat away from the surface of the skin.

So when you sweat, the surface temperature of your skin decreases.

Entering a hot sauna or wearing thick clothes in the summer is

It's an action that generates heat from outside the body.

In this way, the heat of the skin on the outermost layer of the body increases.

Then, as sweat forms and evaporates, it will lower the heat of the skin.

In this process, body fat has no relevance at all.

The skin gets hot from external heat and then cools down with sweat.

However, the heat generated in the body from exercising is a slightly different story.

If we take another look at the structure of subcutaneous fat,

There is subcutaneous fat beneath the skin.

There are muscles located deeper than the subcutaneous fat.

If you exercise to increase muscle mass and use your muscles a lot,

Heat is generated in the muscles.

In this case, it is natural for the body temperature to rise.

Humans are warm-blooded animals that need to maintain a constant body temperature.

I need to lower my elevated body temperature. What should I do in this situation?

Transfer the heat generated in the muscles to the skin.

You need to lower your body temperature by sweating to cool down your skin.

It allows the heat generated in the muscles to escape through the skin.

However, there is an entity that disrupts this process.

It is the subcutaneous fat that is located between the skin and the muscles.

If there is a lot of subcutaneous fat, it becomes difficult for the heat from the muscles to be transferred to the skin.

In this case, it becomes difficult to lower the increased body temperature caused by the heat generated in the muscles.

From the body's perspective, it is necessary to reduce body fat.

So when you generate heat in your body through exercise, the subcutaneous fat decreases.

In summary, it's like wearing thick clothes, turning on the boiler, or going into a sauna.

Actions that generate heat outside the body have little effect on reducing body fat.

The skin just gets hot, and you can lower the surface temperature of the skin by sweating.

On the other hand, in the case of exercise,

Because heat is generated in the muscles located inside the body rather than in the subcutaneous fat.

This means that there will be an effect of reducing body fat.

You need to distinguish between the heat inside the body and the heat outside the body to avoid confusion.

I understand about living in hot conditions, but what happens if you live in cold conditions?

Does body fat increase because it's cold? However, there are also studies that suggest you lose weight in cold weather...

In the next video, I will talk about living in cold conditions.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.
