The tendency to gain weight is determined in childhood and cannot be changed after becoming an adult.

There is a story like this.

But is that really the case?

That's not the case.

You cannot change your body type that tends to gain weight.

One of the main arguments of this story is the number of fat cells.

The increase in the amount of body fat stored in the body is called obesity.

This body fat is stored in fat cells.

When body fat increases, fat cells need to store more, so they will require more storage space.

There are two main ways to create this storage space.

The increase in the number of fat cells is called proliferation, while the enlargement of fat cells is referred to as hypertrophy.

In the 1900s, there was an experiment observing the adipose cells of adults and children.

In the case of children, when body fat increases,

There has been an increase in the number of fat cells due to proliferation.

In the case of adults, when body fat increases,

There has been an increase in size while the number of fat cells remains the same.

Based on this experiment, it has been said that the tendency to gain weight is determined in childhood.

In the case of adults,

It was said that when body fat increases, the number of fat cells does not change, only their size increases.

So having a large number of fat cells means that

This means that there are many fat cells that are increasing in size, which makes it easier to gain weight.

Conversely, if the number of fat cells is low,

This means that it is difficult to gain weight because there are fewer fat cells that can increase in size.

If a person is obese in childhood, the number of fat cells increases.

A person who is obese in childhood will also be obese as an adult, and this becomes a part of their constitution.

Modern humanity does not find it particularly difficult to obtain food.

However, for humanity in the past, obtaining food was quite a difficult task.

Hunting with primitive weapons is difficult in itself.

Even if you succeed in hunting, you cannot store and eat food for a long time.

So there were quite a few times when I couldn't eat and went hungry.

In preparation for that situation, the body has started to store body fat.

So, a body type that easily accumulates body fat has a high number of fat cells.

Currently, humanity has a body type that easily gains weight, which is not ideal.

For humanity in the past, it meant having a constitution that was advantageous for survival.

This is where it gets important.

If the number of fat cells does not increase after becoming an adult,

The number of fat cells should not decrease.

If you find yourself in a situation where you cannot obtain food, and you use body fat as energy.

If the number of fat cells decreases,

Every time you go without food and starve, the number of fat cells can only continue to decrease.

After becoming an adult, the number of fat cells does not increase.

If it decreases but does not increase, then the quantity will inevitably continue to decrease.

This will gradually lead to a body that is unable to store body fat.

If humanity in the past had such a constitution that made it difficult to obtain food, they would have inevitably starved to death.

Humanity has survived without going extinct.

So, if the number of fat cells does not increase after becoming an adult,

There is a claim that it will not decrease.

So, people who are obese in childhood develop a body type that has an increased number of fat cells, leading to weight gain.

After becoming an adult, the number of fat cells does not decrease.

It means that this constitution cannot be changed.

It's a story without dreams or hope.

But if this story is indeed one without dreams or hope,

Because there was someone who gained a very large benefit.

This claim spreads to people at a very fast pace.

Even if you work hard on your diet and exercise to lose weight,

The number of fat cells in adults does not change, so the tendency to gain weight does not change either.

Therefore, there is a risk of gaining weight again at any time.

The only way to change this constitution is

Liposuction surgery removes the fat cells themselves.

If you undergo liposuction, you will not only become slim right away, but also

It is possible to have a body type that does not gain weight at all.

It's very intriguing, isn't it?

The statement that the number of fat cells in adults does not change means that

Hospitals that perform liposuction found it to be a very good material for promotion.

By actively utilizing this for promotion, it will spread to people at a really fast pace.

Did the hospital where I had liposuction do something wrong?

No, that's not the case.

At that time, I truly believed that the number of adult fat cells does not change.

There was simply no reason not to use that information for promotion.

But do the number of fat cells in adults really not change?

That's not the case.

If the number of adipocytes in adults remains unchanged,

A person who has undergone liposuction should not gain weight again.

Because there are no fat cells to store fat.

There are indeed reviews stating that the areas where liposuction was performed do not gain weight.

However, that was when I had just undergone liposuction.

As time goes by, people who gain weight again start to appear.

A representative case is the story of a celebrity who lost 36 kg in 2001.

There was a very popular celebrity who was a chubby character that ate a lot of food.

I suddenly showed up after losing 36kg, surprising everyone.

As people's interest in how I managed to lose weight grew,

A diet video has also been released.

There was a huge uproar when the doctor revealed that they had undergone full-body liposuction.

Even if you undergo full-body liposuction, it is not possible to lose 36 kg.

I think it's fair to say that I lost enough weight through diet and exercise, and received a little help from liposuction.

Anyway, it became a major social issue.

That celebrity is still active now.

My body shape now, 20 years later, is similar to what it was before I started dieting.

So, I had a full body liposuction.

The fat cells have increased again and returned to their original state.

This doesn't only happen to celebrities.

Similar incidents have occurred frequently among ordinary people who have undergone liposuction.

There is a realization that experiments on fat cells need to be conducted again.

So, an experiment was conducted to confirm whether adult fat cells really do not change.

While increasing weight by 3.8 kg

I observed the fat cells in the upper body, lower body, abdomen, and thighs.

There was no change in the subcutaneous fat in the thighs and upper body.

Subcutaneous abdominal fat has undergone hypertrophy, resulting in an increase in the size of fat cells.

The subcutaneous fat in the lower body has undergone proliferation, resulting in an increase in the number of fat cells.

So it has been confirmed that the number of fat cells in adults can increase.

Why did the results differ from the experiments in the 1900s?

This is because the purpose of the experiment is different.

The purpose of the experiments in the 1900s was

The purpose was to observe the differences between adults and children when body fat increases.

So, I compared the abdominal subcutaneous fat of adults and children.

In experiments from the 2000s, abdominal subcutaneous fat was found to be hypertrophied.

It is difficult to view the experiment at that time as manipulated or incorrect.

I just didn't think that fat cells would react differently in different areas.

The number of fat cells in the upper body, abdomen, and thighs hasn't increased, has it?

Is it just the lower body that is getting bigger?

The duration of the experiment was about 4 weeks, and the weight gain was 3.8 kg.

So under these conditions, the number of fat cells only increased in the lower body.

If the weight increases more over a longer period of time,

The number of fat cells in other areas is also likely to increase.

In the case of the celebrity we talked about earlier, they underwent full-body liposuction.

Not only has my lower body returned to its original state, but my entire body has returned to its original state as well.

The fact that the number of fat cells in adults can increase again means that

It is also possible to reduce the number of adipocytes in adults.

Therefore, it is possible to change a body type that gains weight into one that does not gain weight.

It's a story filled with dreams and hope, right?

A body type that doesn't gain weight also involves factors beyond just fat cells.

It is influenced by basal metabolic rate, muscle mass, absorption rate, and gut bacteria.

I will continue the discussion in the next video.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the body type that doesn't gain weight,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

If you found this video helpful, please subscribe and like it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
