If you think you can't diet because healthy foods are not tasty, take a look at this - Part 4 of Cravings That Make You Gain Weight.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the fourth video about gaining weight due to cravings.

In the last video, we discussed the reasons why people develop a taste for foods that make them gain weight and want to eat them frequently.

We talked about ways to change a taste for foods that make you gain weight.

However, even if you change your taste based on the previous video, there is one more problem.

I don't want to eat the diet meal plan.

In order to diet, we should avoid eating foods that make us gain weight.

Because I have to follow a diet plan at the same time.

Not wanting to follow a diet plan is also a problem.

There are several reasons why people dislike diet meals, but the biggest reason is the taste.

Diet meals are tasteless, which is why you don't want to eat them.

In this video, we will discuss why diet meals are often tasteless.

I would like to talk about how to enjoy it deliciously.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it is better to watch them in order.

The link to the previous video is displayed in the top right.

The reason diet meals are tasteless is due to preconceived notions.

Many people have the preconceived notion that diet food is tasteless.

Such prejudices lead to the belief that if you make something delicious and eat it, you won't be able to diet.

Because of this, many people make their diet meals taste bad.

Are you saying that you make it taste bad and eat it?

If the diet food is delicious, it would be easier to stick to the diet.

Who would intentionally make food taste bad to eat?

There are a lot. I think we should do it that way.

For example, if you say you eat salad for dieting,

Many people believe that they should eat only salad without any dressing at all.

If you eat a salad without dressing, it will obviously taste bland.

Another example is if you eat chicken breast for dieting.

There are cases where people think that it should be eaten without adding salt.

So there is a perception that seasonings like salt and sugar should not be used in a diet plan.

The reason for that perception is said to be due to prejudice.

Of course, if the seasoning is too excessively sweet or salty, it could become a problem.

That doesn't mean it has to be so unappetizing that it's hard to eat.

You can season it to a level that is comfortable for me to eat.

So, are you saying that it's okay to add delicious seasonings to the unrefined foods that Ronka mentioned?

No, what kind of diet plan is that!

Even eating like that is part of a diet plan.

I have mentioned it several times in other videos, but...

When you eat certain foods, if your blood sugar rises quickly and significantly,

To lower that blood sugar, insulin is secreted in excess.

Excessively secreted insulin increases body fat and makes us obese.

So, foods that quickly and significantly raise blood sugar levels are classified as fattening foods.

Foods that slowly and slightly raise blood sugar are classified as diet foods.

Ramen is synonymous with fattening food.

In reality, when you eat ramen, your blood sugar rises quickly and significantly.

But what would happen if you eat this ramen with vegetables?

Vegetables help suppress the rise in blood sugar from ramen, which can prevent weight gain.

Among ramen, when you eat bibimyeon, which has a sweet and sour seasoning, just as it is, and

When comparing the situation of eating a total of 210g of vegetables, consisting of 70g each of lettuce, perilla leaves, and cucumber,

When I just ate bibim-myeon.

Fasting blood sugar is 116, 30 minutes after eating it is 156, 1 hour after eating it is 179, and 2 hours after eating it is 185.

When I ate vegetables with bibimyeon,

Fasting blood sugar is 122, 30 minutes after eating it is 135, 1 hour after eating it is 137, and 2 hours after eating it is 121.

When I only eat bibim-myeon, my blood sugar rises quickly and significantly.

When I ate vegetables together, my blood sugar rose slowly and only a little.

I ate bibim-myeon, which is a fattening food, but I only added vegetables, and this is how much I was able to control it.

Eating foods that do not cause weight gain in the first place and adding some seasoning is not a problem.

So, why did the perception arise that we shouldn't consume salt or sugar?

That was discussed in detail in the seasoning series.

In Part 1, we talked about salt, and in Part 2, we discussed sugar.

Why has the perception arisen that one should not eat seasoning?

And I discussed in detail how much you can eat while dieting.

The seasoning series link is currently available at the top right, so if you're curious, you can click to check it out.

So it's okay to eat food that doesn't make you gain weight if you season it.

So, what exactly is food that doesn't make you gain weight?

It is unrefined food.

There is a video I made in the past about how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight.

In that video, we talked about the key principles of dieting and unrefined foods.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have a video on how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight on the right side.
