Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second part of the video where I respond to a question that was posted in the comments.

If you have any questions about the content, please pause the screen and check the question details.

Visceral fat is easy to lose, but subcutaneous fat is not. Is there a good way to lose subcutaneous fat?

In part 1 of the video, the differences between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat are discussed.

We looked into why men's diets and women's diets are different.

Since this continues from the video in Part 1,

For those who have not seen Part 1, there may be misunderstandings or difficulties in understanding the content.

The link to Part 1 of the video is at the top right, so if you haven't watched Part 1, please go and check it out.

In this video, I will talk about exercises to reduce subcutaneous fat.

Considering the content of Part 1 of the video,

I feel like doing thigh exercises will help me lose thigh fat, and doing abdominal exercises will help me lose belly fat.

There is no specific order in which fat is lost, so doing abdominal exercises does not necessarily lead to losing belly fat.

Why is there such a story?

Exercise is an activity that places a strong load on the muscles for a set period of time.

However, the book thighs, natural hip band, and Pilates breathing techniques mentioned in Part 1 of the video are

It is a common behavior in daily life that occurs without a set time, and the burden itself is not high.

Common thigh exercises include half squats, and for abdominal exercises, there are crunches.

The bookworm and natural waistband, as well as the Pilates breathing technique, have a much lower intensity compared to half squats and crunches.

So... "Doing abdominal exercises doesn't make belly fat go away."

The abdominal exercise being referred to in this statement is crunches.

Just because you do crunches diligently doesn't mean that abdominal subcutaneous fat will decrease.

The reason there is such a story is that

Full-body workouts are more effective at reducing subcutaneous fat than targeted exercises.

Usually, when I exercise, I work out for about an hour.

Men, who have higher levels of male hormones, find it relatively easier to build muscle.

At first, I did a full-body workout for one hour.

Once your muscles are developed to a certain extent, you can split your workouts into upper body one day and lower body the next.

If the muscles develop further here, I will split the workouts into one day for chest, one day for back, and one day for lower body.

The reason for starting with full-body workouts instead of splitting them up at first is

At first, the chest muscles are not developed, so the chest muscles are weak.

Because weak chest muscles cannot sustain exercise for an hour.

If I exercise at a low intensity, I can manage to fill an hour, but...

I cannot fill an hour with high-intensity exercise.

Do I have to exercise at a high intensity? Can't I do it at a lower intensity?

There are two main reasons why you should engage in high-intensity exercise.

The first is muscle development.

The reason for exercising is to build muscle and reduce body fat.

If the exercise intensity is low, the muscles do not develop well.

The second is the heat generated by exercise.

In Part 1 of the video, body fat acts as clothing that prevents the loss of body heat.

When a lot of heat is generated by the muscles, it is necessary to dissipate that heat in order to maintain body temperature.

It was said that the reduction of subcutaneous fat occurs because it hinders the dissipation of heat.

As the intensity of exercise increases, a lot of heat is generated during the workout.

Even after the workout is finished, the afterburn effect continues to generate heat.

I discussed the afterburn effect in detail in another video.

The video link is available in the top right, so if you're curious, you can click to watch it.

So, when trying to exercise only specific areas like the abs, thighs, and arms,

You exercise using the small muscles without engaging the large muscles.

Because the muscles are small and weak, they get tired easily, resulting in a low intensity of exercise.

Because it is low-intensity exercise, muscle development is slow.

Because there is no afterburn effect, heat is generated only during exercise.

The heat generated is low because the exercise intensity is low.

However, full-body exercises engage all the muscles in the body, including the large muscles.

The load on each individual muscle is distributed, allowing for high-intensity exercise even if the muscles are weak.

High-intensity exercise leads to rapid muscle development and generates a lot of heat during the workout.

Even after the workout is over, the afterburn effect continues to generate heat.

To reduce subcutaneous fat, full-body exercises are much more effective than exercises targeting specific areas.

So, the recommendation is to avoid exercising specific areas and instead focus on full-body workouts.

If low-intensity exercise is ineffective,

Shouldn't book thighs, natural waistbands, and Pilates breathing techniques also be ineffective?

The book thigh, natural waistband, and Pilates breathing techniques differ from regular exercise.

It's not about having designated exercise time; it's about incorporating it into daily life.

This type of everyday exercise is called NEAT (Non-exercise activity thermogenesis).

Knitting also uses muscles, so every time you knit, you will generate some heat.

The exercise intensity is low, so I don't have much heat.

If you continue doing knit exercises, the heat will be maintained.

If this time is extended, you can achieve effects similar to the afterburn effect of high-intensity exercise.

And while low-intensity exercise for one hour has a light load that makes it difficult for muscles to develop,

Even low-intensity loads applied consistently in daily life can lead to muscle development.

A typical example is the muscles of individuals with severe obesity.

In the case of individuals with severe obesity, if you conduct an InBody test,

I don't exercise at all, but I have a characteristic of having a high muscle mass.

To continuously support a heavy body, muscles are used, and as a result, they develop.

Even low-intensity knit exercises can lead to muscle development if performed frequently and for a long duration.

So, if you do knit exercises occasionally for a short time, it doesn't have much effect, but...

If done frequently, it can help reduce body fat.

And it's not just the book thighs, natural waistbands, and Pilates breathing techniques that are knit exercises.

Standing rather than lying down  
Walking rather than standing

I use the stairs instead of the elevator.

Every action that uses muscles and generates heat in daily life can be considered non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT).

Do you have to exercise to lose body fat?

I’ve seen women who lose body fat without exercising.

There are women who actually do not exercise at all and still manage to lose body fat.

There should be a link to the third part of the video in the top right.

In Part 3 of the video, there will be an explanation of how to reduce subcutaneous fat through dietary control.

Let's summarize the content of parts 1, 2, and 3 to find out the best way to reduce body fat.
