Let's become a person who doesn't gain weight even when eating with a lower absorption rate - Part 6 of becoming a non-weight-gaining body.

All videos have subtitles.

For videos where subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the sixth video about having a body type that doesn't gain weight.

If you're curious about the content of the previous video, the link is available in the top right corner.

You can click and take a look.

In this video, I would like to talk about absorption rates.

Many people think that all the food I eat is fully absorbed by my body.

When you eat food that contains 500 kcal, you think that 500 kcal has been absorbed by your body.

However, that's not actually the case.

A typical example is the comparison between brown rice and white rice.

White rice is what you get when you remove the husk from brown rice.

There is not much difference in nutritional content between brown rice and white rice.

If a person could absorb all the food they eat,

Whether you eat brown rice or white rice, there should be no difference because their nutritional components are similar.

However, in reality, a person who used to eat white rice will lose weight if they switch to brown rice.

This means that the amount of brown rice absorbed by the body is less compared to white rice.

Even if it's not necessarily this difference,

When the body is not well or under stress, digestion does not go well.

If digestion is not good, then absorption will naturally not be effective either.

So, because a person is not a machine,

It means that we cannot necessarily digest and absorb 100% of the food we eat.

What percentage of the food I eat is absorbed by my body? This is called the absorption rate.

This absorption rate is not fixed.

It changes based on the condition of my body and the food I eat.

If it is possible to lower the absorption rate,

Even if you eat a lot of food, the amount absorbed by the body is small.

In that case, it would be possible to have a body that doesn't gain weight even if you eat a lot.

How can the absorption rate be increased, and how can it be decreased?

I will talk about it in detail.

Many people follow a low-calorie diet by reducing the amount of food they eat for weight loss.

Our bodies require energy to survive.

If you reduce the amount of food you eat, you will decrease the energy that enters your body.

Our bodies need to extract as much energy as possible from a small amount of food.

The absorption rate will increase.

It is said that dieting with a low-calorie diet can easily lead to a yo-yo effect.

When following a low-calorie diet, the body's metabolism may decrease.

This is also because the absorption rate increases, leading to a greater amount being absorbed when eating the same food.

Then a question arises here.

When the amount of food consumed is reduced, the absorption rate increases.

If you absorb a lot relative to the amount you eat and have a body type that easily gains weight, then...

On the contrary, when the amount of food consumed increases, the absorption rate decreases.

Is it possible to have a body type that doesn't gain weight even when eating a lot?

It is possible.

When you eat a lot, the absorption rate decreases, resulting in a smaller amount being absorbed by the body.

If it can lead to a body type that doesn't gain weight.

Why do some people become obese from overeating?

If you eat a lot of food, the absorption rate should decrease, so you shouldn't gain weight.

Why do people who eat a lot exist and still gain weight?

It's due to insulin and false hunger.

In the last video, it was mentioned that insulin has the effect of increasing appetite.

Even if you eat a sufficient amount of food,

If that food is a refined food that causes a lot of insulin to be released,

You said that you don't need food, but the insulin causes you to feel hungry again.

It's a hunger that arises even when food isn't needed, so it was referred to as false hunger.

In other words,

In reality, there is not a shortage of food.

It means that our body is misunderstanding that there is a lack of food due to the insulin hormone.

If food is too scarce, the absorption rate increases.

It was said that if there is too much food, the absorption rate decreases.

In reality, there is not a shortage of food.

If our body misunderstands that there is a lack of food because of insulin...

What is the absorption rate?

A high state is maintained.

It's a misunderstanding, but from the body's perspective, it perceives that there is a lack of food.

So, when you eat processed foods, even if you eat a lot, the absorption rate doesn't decrease, which leads to obesity.

When eating unrefined foods, it's said that if you eat a lot, the absorption rate decreases.

However, everyone says they want to eat a lot and not gain weight.

The food that I want to eat a lot at this time refers to refined foods, right?

I know that it's bad for my health and makes me gain weight.

Because it's delicious and I want to eat a lot of it.

Even if it is said that eating a lot of unrefined foods lowers absorption rates,

When you eat refined foods, the absorption rate goes back up.

In the end, isn't this absorption rate meaningless?

No, that's not the case.

The human body does not change quickly.

If you starve yourself or follow a low-calorie diet, your metabolism decreases and your absorption rate increases, but...

Just skipping one meal doesn't mean it will happen right away.

If you skip a meal, and immediately your metabolism decreases and your absorption rate increases, then...

Even if you starve or follow a low-calorie diet, your body fat should not decrease.

I ate less food, but my absorption rate increased, so I absorbed as much as possible.

If the metabolic rate decreases and energy expenditure is reduced,

There is no lack of energy, so there is no need to use body fat.

However, in reality, going on a hunger strike or following a low-calorie diet is something that can be done starting today.

It takes time to lower the body's metabolic rate or to increase absorption.

So the energy supplied by food has decreased, but...

The energy consumed by the body still has a period during which it has not yet decreased.

During that period, body fat will decrease due to energy deficiency.

Because of this, following a low-calorie diet may have a weight loss effect in the beginning.

As time goes by, the effects diminish.

Later on, even if you eat less, you won't be able to lose weight.

After the decrease in the amount of dialogue and the increase in absorption rate,

Reverting this back to its original state also takes a long time.

This often leads to yo-yo dieting.

The amount of food consumed can easily be increased, and the absorption rate is also heightened in this state.

The energy supplied to the body can be increased quickly.

It takes time to increase the metabolic rate, which is the energy the body consumes.

The same goes for lowering the absorption rate.

A diet that includes a sufficient amount of unrefined foods will lead to a lower absorption rate over time.

And this lowered absorption rate does not immediately increase just by eating refined food once.

So, if you have been eating a lot of unrefined foods for a long time, it can lower your absorption rate.

Sometimes, even if you eat a lot of refined foods, the absorption rate remains low.

It is possible to eat a lot of processed foods without gaining weight.

Of course, if you continue to eat a lot of processed foods, your absorption rate will change and you will gain weight again.

While maintaining a diet based on unprocessed foods,

It's okay to eat processed foods occasionally.

So, eating unrefined foods until you're full and lowering the absorption rate is not meaningless.

Rather, I want to have a body type that allows me to eat a lot of the foods I want without gaining weight.

For such people, it is one of the most important factors.

I will summarize.

Processed foods are a cause of obesity.

You should reduce the intake of refined foods and focus on eating unrefined foods.

When I heard this story

One of the concerns many people have is whether they should avoid eating processed foods for their entire lives.

I understand that processed foods themselves are not healthy and that eating a lot of them can lead to obesity.

Most of the food being sold is processed food.

There are situations where one has no choice but to eat processed foods.

Sometimes, there are times when I crave the taste of refined foods.

Processed foods are primarily created for the purpose of selling.

It is made with flavors that people like.

So it's not strange to crave refined foods.

Since you made me like it in the first place, it's only natural that I want to eat it.

In modern society, it is impossible to live without consuming processed foods at all.

That's correct.

So, do we have to eat processed foods and become unhealthy and obese?

This is not right.

If you have no choice but to eat processed foods, you need to create a body that can handle it.

To do that, until I become healthy.

It means to reduce the intake of refined foods and focus on eating unrefined foods.

If you mainly eat unrefined foods,

As I diet, my body becomes healthier and my absorption rate decreases.

After this, even if you eat processed foods, you can somewhat prevent the problems that arise from it.

When I watch mukbang YouTubers,

I have been following a diet that consists of a lot of processed foods for a long time.

Why don't these people gain weight?

There are two main reasons.

The first reason is due to digestive limits, and the second is because of body constitution.

In the next video, I will talk about the body type of a mukbang YouTuber.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 7 of the body type that doesn't gain weight, then I am still in the process of making the video.

Please wait a few days.
