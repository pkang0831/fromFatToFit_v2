The topic of this video is about cutting out refined carbohydrates and tips for consuming diet-friendly carbohydrates.

A question about the content currently displayed on the left side of the screen has been posted in the comments.

This is the third response video regarding this matter. (Please pause to check the question content.)

pkang's theory is understandable and plausible. However, have you ever been obese in your life?

When hungry, people eat, and when not hungry, they don't eat, or they follow theories about healthy carbohydrates, which are indeed good. 

But overweight people are always hungry. And they really love refined carbohydrates.

They know it's not good, but they can't control themselves. They try to quit and attempt again, but they keep failing.

Even strong-willed people crumble in front of food. Please create useful information about severe obesity as well.

Those who have watched the previous video would have understood that refined carbohydrates trigger hunger and increase body fat.

So if we can cut out refined carbohydrates, which we call bad carbohydrates,

You probably understand that it's possible to diet without difficulty because you don't feel frequent hunger.

If you haven't seen the previous video, you can click the link in the top right corner to watch it.

There are two tips for reducing the intake of refined carbohydrates.

The first thing is to start in the morning.

Since a person cannot eat while sleeping,

During sleep, blood sugar levels gradually decrease.

So when I wake up in the morning, my blood sugar is at its lowest.

When blood sugar is at its lowest, eating foods that exclude refined carbohydrates...

Because blood sugar does not rise significantly.

The issue of blood sugar fluctuations mentioned in the first video does not occur.

If there is no issue with blood sugar fluctuations, there is no false hunger, making it easier to cut out refined carbohydrates.

On the contrary, if you have a meal with refined carbohydrates in the morning,

Blood sugar levels become excessively high.

When there is a problem with blood sugar fluctuations, it leads to false hunger, making it difficult to cut out refined carbohydrates.

When we decide to go on a diet, we often can't start right away.

The reason I decide to say "I'll start my diet tomorrow" is this.

The first tip is to start your diet in the morning.

The second tip is to eat until you are full.

The term "eating to fullness" mentioned here refers to

It's not just about eating low-calorie foods that are large in volume to feel full, but rather...

It refers to consuming the calories that the body actually needs.

Most people who try to reduce refined carbohydrates do so for the purpose of dieting.

So, many people tend to reduce their meal portions while also cutting down on refined carbohydrates.

In this case, you have to resist the temptation of refined carbohydrates while also enduring hunger.

It is very difficult to believe both of these things at the same time.

However, it is not necessary to endure both of these at the same time.

If you cut out refined carbohydrates, your meal portions will naturally adjust without me having to restrain myself.

It's not a matter of wanting to eat but holding back.

You will no longer want to eat an excessive amount.

If you don't eat an excessive amount, your weight will naturally decrease.

So there is no need to endure both at the same time.

First, focus on cutting out refined carbohydrates.

Then how should one plan their diet?

If you are hungry, make sure to eat enough vegetables and meat.

If you're full but your mouth is bored and you crave something sweet, you can eat some fruit.

By doing this, the hunger caused by a lack of calories can be resolved with vegetables and meat.

The craving for sweet foods is satisfied with fruit.

You can cut out refined carbohydrates without stress.

After about three days, the cravings for refined carbohydrates will disappear.

When I eat, it tastes good, but I feel like "it's okay if I don't eat."

However, please specify the quantities. Some people might wonder what to do if they eat too many vegetables, meat, or fruits.

It's okay, I won't gain weight.

It is true that eating too much can lead to weight gain.

I ate too much, so how can I not gain weight?

However, eating too much is overeating, and this is not a normal state.

The human body is designed to want to stop eating when it has consumed enough food.

However, refined carbohydrates interfere with this, which is why it leads to obesity.

Cutting out refined carbohydrates.

If you compose your diet with unrefined carbohydrates such as vegetables, fruits, and meat,

It automatically adjusts so that you don't eat too much.

It is not necessary to measure the grams of food.

If you eat enough to feel full, it will naturally be an appropriate amount.

And if we eat a moderate amount, unnecessary fat in our bodies will naturally decrease.

You will be surprised if you try it yourself.

"I'm eating less than I thought?" "I'm eating a little less than I expected?"

You might think this way, but you need to try it yourself to understand.

In summary, eat a hearty meal with this type of diet composition.

If you consume this from the morning, you can easily cut out refined carbohydrates.

The method of dieting that can be done for those who are severely obese is what the person who asked the question is inquiring about.

Sounds plausible, right?
