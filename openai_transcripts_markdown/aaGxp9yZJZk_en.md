I get off work late, so I eat and go straight to bed. How can I diet?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

If you don't eat dinner, you will lose weight.

Fasting after 6 PM leads to weight loss.

There are stories like this, but is there actually any effect?

A question with this kind of content came up, so I made a video to answer it.

In that video, it was mentioned that we need to distinguish between dinner and a late-night snack.

There are many cases where the issue of late-night snacks is discussed as evidence that not eating dinner leads to weight loss.

The problem with late-night snacks is eating food late at night.

It means sleeping without having digested food.

In this case, while sleeping, digestion progresses, leading to various problems.

That issue is causing difficulties with dieting or leading to weight gain.

Based on a typical meal size, the time required for digestion is about 4 hours.

Therefore, if I go to sleep 4 hours after having dinner and my digestion is complete,

There is no problem sleeping after digestion is complete.

If you eat dinner late and go to bed less than four hours after digestion is complete,

Digestion occurs while sleeping, and that could be a problem.

This can also be confirmed in experiments.

A group that primarily eats breakfast and either eats little for dinner or skips it altogether.

When comparing the group that primarily eats dinner and the group that eats little or no breakfast.

In an experiment where dinner was scheduled around 6 PM, there was no difference observed.

In the experiment where dinner time was set until 11 PM,

In the group that primarily eats dinner and either eats little or skips breakfast,

The effects of the diet have appeared to be much less significant.

If you set dinner time too late, it will turn into a late-night snack.

Eating late-night snacks and not eating them makes a big difference in dieting.

The experiment I observed has a meal time until 11 PM, but...

There was also an experiment that included the condition of having to sleep three hours after eating.

If I ate late at night but digested it and then slept, it shouldn't be considered a late-night snack.

In that experiment, the group that ate primarily in the morning had better results in their diet.

Why is this like this?

It is due to the difference in sleep.

Allowing meals until 11 PM.

Under the condition that you should sleep three hours after eating,

In the worst case, you have to eat at 11 PM and stay awake until 2 AM.

In this case, compared to the group that has breakfast,

The sleep duration is short, and the quality of sleep inevitably declines.

As mentioned in the sleep diet series, sleep has a significant impact on dieting.

When there is a difference in the quality and quantity of sleep,

There will inevitably be differences in the effects of dieting.

However, after reviewing the content up to this point,

A question has been raised about what is the best approach for office workers.

For those whose workplace is far from home,

Even if I leave work right at 6, I will get home after 7.

Even if I wash up and prepare dinner right away, it will still be 8 o'clock.

If you have a meal at 8 o'clock, digestion will be complete 4 hours later, which will be midnight.

Because the distance to work is far, I have to wake up early in the morning.

That would result in a lack of sleep time.

In reality, the distance between home and work is far, so I have to wake up at 6 AM to commute.

If I don't sleep until midnight after having dinner at 8 o'clock,

The next day, a comment was posted saying that it was very tiring and difficult to work.

In such cases, it's best to have a light dinner.

The body's response varies depending on what you eat.

It's a very obvious statement.

However, in diet information, this aspect is often overlooked.

A typical example is the debate between intermittent fasting and eating small amounts frequently.

In intermittent fasting,

When you eat food, insulin is released, and insulin inhibits the burning of body fat.

There are people who believe that fasting periods without eating are necessary for dieting.

From that person's perspective, eating a little bit frequently can never be a way to lose weight.

If you eat frequently, insulin will continue to be released.

Then, fat burning will not occur.

However, until intermittent fasting became popular,

It has often been recommended as a dieting method to eat small amounts frequently.

In fact, many people have succeeded in their diets by eating small amounts frequently.

When you eat food, insulin is released, and when insulin is released, fat burning will be suppressed.

How is it possible to diet while eating frequently?

It's not that I eat it often, but rather that I can do it because I eat a little bit frequently.

Insulin is not just a hormone that inhibits the burning of body fat.

Store carbohydrates as glycogen.

Help proteins to be used for muscle synthesis.

Storing fat as body fat.

I work on securing energy to use during the time I don't eat.

So it means the hormones that process the nutrients from the food I eat.

Because it is a hormone that processes nutrients.

The amount of insulin released varies depending on the quantity of food I eat.

If you eat only a little food, the amount of insulin released will also be small.

If the amount of insulin released is low, the duration of fat burning suppression will also be shorter.

Therefore, even if you eat often, you can still lose weight if you eat a little at a time.

Returning to the original story.

After finishing the last meal, I have to sleep in four hours.

This is based on a typical meal portion.

If you eat lightly, it doesn't necessarily take 4 hours.

So to summarize,

A person who can sleep four hours after finishing dinner and digesting.

Having dinner does not pose a problem for dieting.

However, I have no choice but to eat dinner late or go to bed early.

If you need to sleep within 4 hours after having dinner,

It's better to have a light dinner if possible.

The body's response varies depending on what and how much you eat.

If you have a light dinner, the time needed for digestion decreases.

So it might not be a problem if you don't sleep exactly after 4 hours have passed.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

You mentioned that sleeping on an undigested stomach can cause various problems.

Please explain in detail what issues lead to weight gain.

If you eat the same and move the same, will you gain weight if you eat and go to sleep right away?

There was a question like this before, so I made a detailed explanation video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.
