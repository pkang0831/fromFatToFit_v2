Why do bodybuilders only eat chicken breast salad?

Hello, this is pkang.

Among the foods that people who build muscle eat, the most representative ones are chicken breast and protein shakes.

But why do people eat chicken breast and protein shakes when they want to build muscle?

It may be easy to think that it's mainly to eat a lot of protein, but that's just one reason; there are other reasons as well.

In this video, I will talk about different reasons.

If you consume a lot of refined carbohydrates, your blood sugar levels can rise significantly.

To lower blood sugar, a hormone called insulin is secreted.

Insulin is responsible for storing glucose and fat as body fat.

Excessive insulin secretion leads to obesity.

So, we need to reduce the intake of refined carbohydrates to lower insulin secretion.

This is the recent common knowledge about dieting that has been widely shared.

The less insulin is secreted because of this, the better.

There are cases where people think that not secreting it at all is the best for dieting.

The problem is that too much insulin is being secreted to lower the elevated blood sugar.

Insulin itself is not a bad hormone.

Insulin does not only increase body fat.

Insulin also plays a role in converting glucose into glycogen for storage.

It also helps in the synthesis of protein into muscle.

Glycogen is the energy used by muscles, primarily during exercise.

When there is a lack of insulin, glycogen becomes insufficient, making it difficult to exercise properly.

Even if you force yourself to exercise, your muscles won't develop well.

Insulin, which helps protein to be synthesized into muscle, is lacking.

To achieve a slim figure by reducing body fat, it is necessary to develop muscles through exercise.

Insulin is helpful for dieting, right?

When the low-carb, high-fat diet, which reduces carbohydrate intake, became famous as a method for dieting.

In the bodybuilding community, the reason they say "a low-carb, high-fat diet hinders dieting" is because of this.

If carbohydrates are restricted too severely, the secretion of insulin decreases.

When insulin levels decrease, it's hard to exercise, and even if you do exercise, your muscles don't develop well.

And one more important thing is

Insulin does not only respond to carbohydrates.

It also reacts to proteins and fats.

It gets interesting from here.

Protein increases the secretion of insulin, while fat has the effect of reducing insulin secretion.

A representative experiment involves eggs.

The egg white is mostly made up of protein, while the egg yolk contains fat.

When comparing the case of eating only the egg white without the yolk to the case of eating both the egg white and yolk together,

When I ate the egg white and yolk together, the insulin secretion was lower.

So, even if you consume the same amount of protein, if you eat fat along with it, the amount of insulin secretion decreases.

In order for muscles to grow, glycogen is needed for exercise.

Protein necessary for muscle growth.

Insulin is needed for glycogen to be stored and for proteins to be used in muscle synthesis.

Carbohydrates serve as the building blocks for glycogen while simultaneously inducing the secretion of insulin.

Protein serves as the building block for muscles while simultaneously inducing the secretion of insulin.

Fat actually suppresses the secretion of insulin.

In theory, it is possible to eat only carbohydrates and proteins without consuming fats.

It is said to be the best for muscle development.

Eating refined carbohydrates at this time can significantly raise blood sugar levels, leading to obesity.

You should eat vegetables and fruits that do not raise blood sugar levels significantly.

In that case, chicken breast, which is low in fat and high in protein,

It is said that a chicken breast salad with vegetables and fruits is the best.

This is why bodybuilders eat a lot of chicken breast salad.

And when I exercised while taking supplements like protein shakes.

The reason why it feels more effective is

This phenomenon occurs because only protein was consumed without any fat.

So, is it good for dieting to either not eat fat or take supplements?

That's not the case.

This is a story about someone who practices bodybuilding and needs to increase their muscle mass by at least 1 gram.

Unrefined carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables, and brown rice are

Because the carbohydrate content is low or it is not easily digested and absorbed.

Even if you eat a large amount, it won't be a problem due to excess carbohydrates.

However, refined carbohydrates like white rice, flour, and sugar have a high carbohydrate content and are quickly digested and absorbed.

Eating a large amount can lead to problems due to excess carbohydrates.

When there is an excess of carbohydrates, blood sugar levels rise too high, leading to a large secretion of insulin.

Due to the large amount of insulin secreted, body fat increases, leading to obesity.

However, the problems caused by processed foods do not only arise from carbohydrates.

The same problem can occur with refined fats and refined proteins.

The protein shake that we commonly refer to as a supplement is

It is a product that has been processed to make it easy to consume a lot of protein.

Because it is in a powdered form that is mixed with water, it has the characteristic of being quickly digested and absorbed.

If you consume too much protein through protein shakes,

As the body receives an excess supply of protein, there can be side effects due to protein overload.

Otherwise, it could lead to problems due to excessive secretion of insulin.

In the case of someone who does bodybuilding, they need to increase their muscle mass, even if just a little.

Even if health issues arise from excessive protein, there are people who are willing to accept that to some extent.

And even if insulin is secreted in large amounts, leading to an increase in body fat,

Because I have a lot of physical activity, it's not difficult to burn body fat.

However, for the average person, there is no need to take such risks to increase muscle mass.

And because they have less physical activity than bodybuilders,

Following this method may actually increase body fat and hinder your diet.

So in the case of the general public,

If you change the types of carbohydrates you eat to non-zero and intentionally do not eat insufficiently,

The reduction in insulin secretion due to fat can be sufficiently increased by unrefined carbohydrates.

So in the case of the general public,

Eating a balanced diet of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from unrefined foods is the best approach for dieting.

It's best to think of protein shakes as a supplement when it's difficult to consume enough protein.

In the next video, we will find out how much protein you need to consume for muscle growth.

There are currently two videos on the screen, and once the next video is completed, I will have it appear on the right.

If the video on the right is not about muscles and proteins, please wait a few days as we are still in the process of making the video.
