When does the food we eat a lot during the holidays actually turn into real weight?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

A question about holiday dieting has come up, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the content of the question.

It's almost Chuseok, Mr. pkang.

The foods we eat during holidays are mostly those that can make us gain weight.

I know that not eating is the best option, but realistically, it's difficult to do that.

The weight gained during the holidays can be lost quickly now.

If you don't lose weight quickly, it will turn into fat that's hard to lose over time, so you need to start dieting soon.

I heard this story. Is it really true?

It's a question about this kind of content. Let's discuss it in detail.

Dieting is a difficult and challenging task. This perception is quite common.

Why is this happening?

Many people go on diets, but there are often many cases of failure or giving up.

So why do many people fail and give up on their diets?

There are various reasons, but the biggest reason is time.

Body fat does not increase quickly, nor does it decrease quickly.

Dieting needs to be maintained for a considerable amount of time.

The longer the time, the more variables are bound to arise.

At first, my determination to diet was strong, but as time went on, it gradually weakened.

So there are times when people lose the motivation to continue their diet and stop.

My surroundings have changed, making it difficult to maintain my diet and exercise.

So there are cases where one cannot continue dieting.

If it were possible to quickly reduce body fat, it would be great to be able to lose weight in a short period of time.

It is possible to finish the diet before such variables arise.

If that were the case, there wouldn't be so many people who fail at dieting.

Losing body fat takes a long time.

So dieting is hard and difficult.

I unconsciously learn this kind of information while I am on a diet or when I observe someone who is dieting.

This is information I have acquired through experience.

However, there is information that directly contradicts this.

During holidays, it is common to eat more food than usual.

If you eat more than usual, your weight will naturally increase.

However, reducing the weight that has increased like this is not that difficult.

In reality, it usually takes about 1 to 2 weeks to return to the original weight.

Reducing body fat takes a long time, which is why dieting is difficult and challenging.

I am aware of it this way.

The weight gained during the holidays can be reduced in a short period of time.

This does not only happen during holidays.

When you go on a trip, you eat a lot of food or

It feels like we ate a lot of food during the year-end and New Year's parties.

I ate more food than usual because of the event.

In cases of rapid weight gain, it applies to everyone.

Dieting conflicts with the existing information that it takes a long time.

However, both of these pieces of information are obtained through experience.

Dieting takes a long time.

This is also information I gained through my experiences.

The weight gained from eating a lot during an event can be lost quickly.

This is also information I gained through my experiences.

The information I have gained through experience is quite reliable.

We will find a way for both of these to be correct.

The method I found is to think separately.

Eating a lot of food can lead to weight gain.

This fat is not real fat yet; it is fake fat, so it can be easily lost.

However, as time passes, fake flesh becomes real flesh.

When it actually becomes fat, it takes a long time to lose weight.

Is there really such a thing as real fat and fake fat? Does that even make sense?

The expression "real fat, fake fat" does have its issues, but...

It can be explained based on weight.

The human body is made up of 60-70% water.

The water that remains in the body is called body water.

Water has weight and volume.

When body water increases, weight goes up and the body becomes bulkier.

This body water is influenced by two factors.

The first is carbohydrates, and the second is sodium.

Carbohydrates are stored in the body along with water.

If you eat a lot of carbohydrates, the amount of carbohydrates stored in your body will increase.

The amount of water stored along with those carbohydrates also increases.

Sodium must maintain a constant concentration in our body.

If you consume a lot of salt, the amount of sodium entering your body increases.

We try to adjust the concentration by increasing the moisture content.

If the food is too salty, you can think of adding water to make it less salty.

During the holidays, people eat more food than usual.

Since I'm eating more than usual, a lot of carbohydrates and sodium are entering my body.

This causes an increase in body water.

When body water increases, weight goes up and the body becomes bulkier.

As I gain weight and my body becomes thicker, I start to look like I've put on weight.

It's not that I've actually gained weight, but I look like I have.

Unlike body fat, body water can be increased or decreased quickly.

When looking at the changes in the body due to body water levels,

It seems like you gained weight in a short period and then lost it just as quickly.

However, it's a bit difficult to call this a diet.

Just because we sweat in the sauna and lose 1 kg of weight,

You wouldn't say that you've lost 1kg of weight.

It's not body fat that has been lost, but body water.

By drinking water to replenish the fluids lost through sweat, you can return to your original weight.

In the same concept.

Even if you eat a lot during the holidays and your body water content increases, leading to weight gain...

It is not that I gained weight.

It is an increase in body water, not body fat.

As time passes and moisture is lost, you return to your original weight.

The weight gained from water retention is not real fat, so it's fake weight.

Weight gained from body fat is truly weight gained, so it is real fat.

If we express it this way, saying "real fat" and "fake fat" is not completely incorrect.

However, if you don't quickly reduce the fake weight, which is increased by body water, and time passes,

It's not that dieting becomes difficult because it actually turns into fat.

Body water does not turn into body fat over time.

Therefore, even if you have gained weight from eating a lot of holiday food during the holidays,

You don't have to feel the pressure to reduce it quickly.

As time passes, body water decreases, and you naturally return to your original weight.

After following a diet plan, I stopped the diet once it was over.

If you eat the foods you used to eat before starting your diet,

Like returning to the original weight.

While eating holiday food during the holiday, I stop eating holiday food after the holiday ends.

If you eat the food you had before the holiday,

It is natural to return to your weight before the holidays.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

Body fat does not increase in a short period of time, nor does it decrease in a short period of time.

A diet to lose body fat can take a long time.

Second

When a special situation arises, such as a holiday, where people eat more food than usual,

Weight can increase rapidly in a short period of time.

This is an increase in weight due to body water, not body fat.

Weight gained from water retention can be reduced in a short period of time.

Third

Just because time passes, it doesn't mean that body water turns into body fat.

To reduce weight gained from water retention, no special methods are needed.

I can organize it like this.

There is no need to be surprised or worried if your weight has increased after the holiday.

You just need to consistently follow the proper diet you were already doing.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

You said not to look for special methods, but to consistently follow a proper diet.

What is a proper diet?

Can I just eat chicken breast and sweet potatoes?

I explained the diet methods in detail in another video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have a video about the principles of dieting and meal plans available in the top left.

After watching that video, you can choose a diet that suits you and follow it.

While dieting with a diet plan,

If you stop your diet and eat the foods you used to eat before the diet,

You mentioned that you would gain weight again.

So, does that mean I have to eat a diet plan for my whole life?

You don't have to eat a lifelong diet plan.

In the past, there was a comment saying that they didn't want to eat diet food for a thousand years, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

Eating a lot during the holidays can lead to weight gain.

At this time, the weight is increased due to body water, so it will naturally decrease after the holiday, right?

So, how is your period?

When a woman has her menstrual period, her appetite increases, leading her to eat more and gain weight.

Does this also go away on its own after my period ends?

This is a frequently asked question, so I made a video about it in the past.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

I know that eating a lot leads to weight gain, and that's why I need to diet, but...

What should someone do if they gain weight even when they eat little?

There was a similar question that came up before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
