Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video where I respond to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

I recommend reading books that encourage vegetarianism.

You requested reviews for two books in the comments.

In the first video, we talked about...

The first video link is at the top right, so if you're curious about the content of the first video, please click to watch it.

In this video, I will talk about.

The content of the book can be summarized into two main points.

The first is that health issues can be resolved through dietary habits.

The second point is that various interest groups are aware of this information.

It means that they are either refusing to acknowledge or hiding information for their own benefit.

These two topics always appear in vegetarian-related documentary videos or recommended vegetarian books.

As always, I agree that health issues can be resolved through dietary habits.

I believe that there can certainly be interest groups that do not acknowledge certain issues for their own benefit.

The idea that dietary habits can solve health problems can be divided into three main points.

The first is that eating unprocessed plant-based foods has health benefits.

The second point is that when consuming protein, cancer cells grow.

The third point is when looking at extensive statistical data.

There is a difference between areas that are affected by diseases and those that are not.

Regions that do not suffer from diseases have consumed fewer animal products.

Combining these three reasons leads to the conclusion that a vegetarian diet, which excludes animal products, is beneficial for health.

Let's take a look at this one by one.

The first unprocessed plant-based food.

So I completely agree that consuming unrefined plant-based foods is good for health.

So I also tell people to eat a lot of unrefined plant-based foods.

The second protein helps the growth of cancer cells. This is also true.

However, we need to consider whether we should not eat protein or eat it in smaller amounts because cancer cells grow.

The book discusses experiments that show how protein promotes the growth of cancer cells.

First, a carcinogenic substance is injected into the rat to induce cancer in the rat.

Next, the mice were divided into a group that generally consumes protein and

We divide into groups with extremely restricted protein intake.

After conducting the experiment this way,

The group of mice that consumed a typical amount of protein all developed cancer cell growth, leading to health issues.

It is reported that the group with extremely restricted protein intake did not experience cancer cell growth.

If this experiment is misinterpreted, it could be understood as saying that eating protein causes cancer.

The mice used in the experiment were intentionally injected with carcinogens to induce cancer before the experiment was conducted.

So it's not that eating protein causes cancer.

After being diagnosed with cancer due to other factors, consuming protein can lead to the growth of cancer cells.

If you don't consume protein, cancer cells do not grow. This is what it means.

Anyway, it is true that protein does promote the growth of cancer cells.

These days, there are carcinogens in the air, so it's impossible to avoid them.

So, is not eating protein good for health?

Why does protein promote the growth of cancer cells in the first place? This is where we need to start thinking.

People who exercise to build muscle consider protein intake to be very important.

Because protein is a nutrient that makes up the body.

This is because muscle cells need protein to grow.

The important thing is that protein not only helps to build muscle.

Nutrients that are involved in the growth of all cells, including nails, toenails, hair, and skin.

Protein is originally a nutrient that promotes cell growth, and since cancer cells are also cells, they grow as well.

To put it the other way around,

If I do not consume protein, cells cannot grow.

This means that while cancer cells will not grow, there is the issue that other cells will not grow either.

In fact, when young children are put on a vegetarian diet, it often leads to stunted growth due to insufficient cell development.

In some countries, there are laws that classify forcing a young child to follow a vegetarian diet as child abuse.

And the same content appears in the book as well.

Rural areas in China have extremely limited access to animal-based foods... which means protein intake is severely restricted in these regions.

In this area, the average age of menarche for women is quite late at 17 years old.

It can be interpreted that the age of menarche is delayed due to the slow rate of physical growth.

Isn't it because children are in their growth period, while it doesn't matter for adults?

The human body continuously repeats the cycle of old cells dying and new cells being created.

In reality, human skin sheds dead cells every day, resulting in the formation of keratin, while new cells are generated through division.

After about four weeks, the skin on the entire body will be replaced with new cells.

After about 7 years, all the bone cells will be replaced with new cells.

In addition to skin and bones, other cells, including muscles, also perform the same functions.

This is important from here on.

As time passes, old cells inevitably arise.

In that case, old cells must die off and new cells need to take their place.

What will happen if there is a lack of proteins necessary to create new cells?

First, the number of cells will decrease.

Dead cells continue to form, but the division of new cells is decreasing due to a lack of proteins.

The number of cells decreases, and the body's physical functions, including bones and muscles, gradually decline.

However, it is not possible to continuously reduce the number of cells.

If you keep reducing it, your body won't be able to sustain itself.

To prevent this, our body reacts in the following way:

I try to use the cells for a very long time.

Cells that should have died after completing their functions are being continuously used instead.

In that case, the cells will not function properly, and as a result, the body will weaken, leading to other health issues.

I will go back to the experiment details once more.

To reiterate the details of the experiment,

The mice used in the experiment were intentionally made to develop cancer by injecting them with carcinogens.

In the case where I have cancer, consuming protein means that cancer cells use the protein as nourishment to grow.

In other words, if I hadn't gotten cancer, there would be no cancer cells growing from the protein I consume.

In that case, the content of this experiment does not apply.

Since there are carcinogens in the air, it is impossible to avoid cancer. Shouldn't we be cautious in advance?

There are also stories like this.

If I limit my protein intake without having cancer, my body becomes weak, right?

In that case, immunity against cancer decreases, and the ability to defend against cancer diminishes.

Rather, it can lead to cancer.

Therefore, it cannot be said that drastically limiting protein intake is necessarily good for health.

The last third.

When looking at extensive statistical data, there was a difference between regions that experienced disease and those that did not.

Regions that do not suffer from diseases consume fewer animal products.

This is based on statistical data, so it is naturally true.

The important thing here is what animal-based foods are discussed in the book.

Not only the theme of this video

The vegetarian recommended books that I have received so far,

I received a recommendation for a documentary that advocates for vegetarianism.

There is a common characteristic among these types of videos.

In the case of plant-based foods, unprocessed vegetables and fruits are good for health.

I will talk about distinguishing unhealthy processed plant-based foods.

So processed plant-based foods are not good for your health, so you should avoid eating these foods.

Eat unprocessed vegetables, fruits, and starchy foods. This is what is being said.

However, there is no distinction made in animal products at all.

To make it easier to understand why this is a problem, let me give you an example.

Sugar, flour, and white rice are plant-based foods.

However, eating a lot can lead to obesity and cause various health problems.

This is something that even vegetarians agree with.

So they say not to eat things like this and to eat unprocessed foods instead.

However, if I through a YouTube video or a book

After listing various health problems that arise from consuming sugar, flour, and white rice,

What would happen if we say that not eating plant-based foods is good for health because of these issues?

First of all, that information itself is not incorrect.

It is true that consuming sugar, flour, and white rice can negatively affect health.

It is also true that sugar, flour, and white rice are plant-based foods.

Perhaps the author of this book, along with those who advocate for a vegetarian diet,

There are plant-based foods that are good for health and plant-based foods that are bad for health.

You are currently portraying all plant-based foods as if they are bad, based on unhealthy plant-based foods.

That's wrong.

The content I want to talk about is the same.

Animal products can also be categorized into processed and unprocessed foods.

Processed foods are naturally bad for health.

However, without distinguishing between these two things,

Processed animal products that are not good for health.

It is wrong to portray this as a problem with all animal products.

If we categorize plant-based foods into processed and unprocessed.

Animal products should also be categorized into processed and unprocessed.

The statistical data in the book does not distinguish between processed and unprocessed animal products.

Then, naturally, health problems will arise.

However, it is incorrect to speak of this as a problem with all animal products.

In summary, I completely agree that eating a lot of plant-based foods is good for health.

And it is true that protein promotes the growth of cancer cells.

The reason is that protein is a nutrient that helps grow the cells in the body.

Cancer cells grow because they are also cells.

Restricting protein intake to prevent the growth of cancer cells is

It can cause other health issues because it prevents the growth of cells throughout the body.

So I think it's good to consume an appropriate amount.

And the statistical data is also true.

However, in the case of this statistical data, plant-based foods are categorized into processed and unprocessed.

Animal products have differences that arise from not distinguishing between processed and unprocessed.

It is somewhat difficult to accept the idea that one should not consume animal products based on statistical data.

Sounds plausible, right?
