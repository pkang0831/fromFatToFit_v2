What do you think about the content of the book "Confessions of a Vegetarian Doctor"?

This is the second video.

In the first video, we discussed the parts of the book that we agree with and those that we do not.

The first video link is on the top right, so if you're curious, click to watch it.

In this video, we will discuss whether humans are starch-eating animals.

The book presents various reasons that humans originally did not eat meat.

It claims to be a starch-eating animal that consumes starchy foods and plant-based products.

The first argument is that chimpanzees, which share 99% of their DNA with humans, are pure vegetarians.

Therefore, considering DNA similarity, it is argued that a vegetarian diet is suitable for the human body.

However, chimpanzees were once thought to be herbivores that only ate plant-based foods.

British zoologist and peace activist Jane Goodall confirmed that chimpanzees are omnivorous animals.

And if you have watched a documentary about chimpanzees,

You may have seen the chimpanzee on the screen eating a monkey.

On November 29, 2013, SBS aired an episode of "Law of the Jungle" in Savannah.

For the first time in the country, a chimpanzee eating a monkey was broadcast.

The theory that the chimpanzee discussed in the book is a herbivore has been concluded to be incorrect.

I'm not sure why the book said that chimpanzees are herbivores.

Chimpanzees are omnivores, and

To understand what humans should eat, we need to consider the DNA similarity with chimpanzees.

It concludes that the human body is indeed omnivorous.

The second argument is that early humans expanded their range of activity on Earth.

The reason why the brain has grown more than three times larger than that of other primates is...

In summer and autumn, I eat fruit.

The claim is that calories were obtained through starchy foods like tubers and grains during spring and winter.

Among the videos I made in the past,

Can you get enough protein from a vegetarian diet? There is a video on this.

In this video, to obtain essential amino acids and proteins that are crucial for the body from plant-based foods,

It was mentioned that each person should consume 2 to 3 kg of plant-based foods per day.

On the other hand, with meat, you can obtain the same amount of essential amino acids and protein by consuming just 500g.

The video link is at the top right, so if you're curious about why this calculation came out this way, click to watch.

Let's assume there is a tribe of 100 early humans with a level of brain development similar to that of non-human primates.

If early humans had underdeveloped brains, they would have required fewer nutrients compared to modern humans.

So let's assume that when eating only vegetarian food, you only need to eat 1 kg instead of the 2-3 kg that is typically required.

If it's an animal product, it would be 250g, which is half of 500g.

Assuming that this tribe lived a vegetarian lifestyle, eating only vegetables, fruits, and starchy foods without consuming meat.

The daily required amount of plant-based food is 100 kg.

In a month, 3 tons (3,000 kg) of plant-based food is needed.

Early humans, who could not farm due to underdeveloped brains,

Was it really possible to gather 3 tons of plant-based food in a month?

If you calculate it that way, you would need 25 kg of meat per day, which amounts to 750 kg in a month.

Is this an amount that can be obtained through hunting?

The weight of a cow is approximately 600 kg.

When a 600kg cow is slaughtered, the weight of the pure meat, excluding the internal organs and bones, is approximately 350kg.

However, early humans must have eaten the organs as well, so if we consider the weight of the organs...

When a 600kg cow is slaughtered, approximately 400kg of edible animal products can be obtained.

In that case, if 100 tribe members work together, they only need to hunt 2 small animals a month.

This is not an amount that is realistically impossible.

It is not accurate to say that all 100 members of the tribe went out hunting.

Some went out hunting, while others likely engaged in gathering activities.

By combining the animal-based foods and plant-based foods obtained in this way, you would have been able to obtain much more nutrition than from a vegetarian diet.

In that case, gathering 3 tons of plant-based food per month and

If we compare the difficulty of hunting two animals in a month,

It is unlikely that early humans lived solely on a vegetarian diet without consuming meat.

Moreover, in order to obtain enough nutrients for the brain to grow three times larger, a meat-based diet was essential.

Humans do not have sharp teeth or claws like carnivorous animals, so it is said that they are not suited for a meat-based diet.

That is content from the book.

However, it is not the claim made by the author of the book.

There is a translator who has conveyed the content of the book.

The translator discusses the content.

What is the human hand suited for eating?

What types of food are human teeth suited for?

When thinking about this,

It is said that it is more appropriate to consider them herbivores because their teeth are not well-developed for a carnivorous diet and they do not have sharp claws.

Regarding this, it's from a review of the video "Capital's Table" that I made earlier.

There is a video titled "Are Humans Herbivores?"

This video covers it in detail. You can click the video link in the upper right corner to watch it.

I heard that there is a lot of evidence in books that ancient humans consumed starch.

The difference between vegetarianism and meat-eating is clearly outlined here.

When it comes to food, there are plant-based foods and animal-based foods.

Vegetarianism is the belief that one should not consume animal products.

It means that you should only eat plant-based foods.

However, Yusik believes that it is acceptable to eat both animal and plant-based foods.

In other words, the distinction between vegetarianism and meat-eating is based on whether or not one can eat meat.

Both of them commonly eat vegetables.

So, the evidence that you ate starchy foods is just evidence that you ate starchy foods.

This does not serve as evidence that one did not eat meat.

The book mentions that ancient humans primarily consumed starchy foods.

It mentions that ancient Egyptian nobles ate meat.

So just because I ate starchy foods doesn't mean I didn't eat meat.

You can eat starchy foods while consuming meat.

I will summarize.

It is true that there are many records of consuming starchy foods in the past, but

This is evidence that starch-based foods were consumed, but it does not serve as evidence that meat was not eaten.

Realistically speaking, it would have been impossible for early humans to survive solely by foraging.

They would have engaged in carnivorous activities through hunting.

And since chimpanzees, which share 99% of their DNA with humans, also eat meat,

The claim that humans should not eat meat and should only consume starchy foods as a starch-eating animal is

It's hard to understand.

Sounds plausible, right?

In the next video, we will discuss the topic that starch and carbohydrates do not convert into fat.
