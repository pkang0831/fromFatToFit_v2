Unconscious Habits That Make You Gain Weight - Sleep Diet Part 4

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitle feature.

This is the fourth video about sleep and dieting.

In the first video, I talked about the reasons why appetite increases when you can't sleep.

In the second video, I talked about the reason why you can gain weight even if you don't eat when you can't sleep.

So, if you don't get enough sleep, that alone can lead to weight gain.

On the contrary, getting proper sleep alone can lead to weight loss.

Because of this, getting enough sleep is as important as diet and exercise in a diet.

However, there are quite a few people who want to sleep but cannot.

There are various causes of this insomnia.

In the third video, we will discuss eating habits that disrupt sleep and lead to weight gain.

On the contrary, we talked about how to develop eating habits that promote weight loss by getting good sleep.

In this video, we will discuss how common behaviors can disrupt our sleep.

I will talk about what makes you gain weight because of that.

In modern society, where technology has advanced, we can live brightly even at night.

Before the advancement of technology,

The day was bright with the sun shining, and the night was dark when the sun had set.

Our bodies adjust to the environment; when the surroundings are bright, we prepare for activity.

When the surroundings get dark, it is time to prepare for sleep.

So it's natural to feel sleepy at night.

I can't sleep at night either.

This is because there is an entity that causes confusion in the body.

It's a smartphone.

Many people fall asleep just like that while lying in bed at night and using their smartphones.

In this way, our bodies become confused.

The surroundings are definitely dark, so it seems like we need to prepare well.

Strangely, only the area around the face is particularly bright.

Information keeps coming in through the eyes, so the brain is actively working.

In this way, our body perceives the situation as one where it is night, but we cannot sleep.

In the last video, we briefly talked about the fight-or-flight response to stress.

In the past, situations that caused stress for humanity were mostly life-threatening situations.

In such situations, the struggle to overcome threats to life through fighting and

I had to choose one of the escapes while quickly fleeing from a life-threatening situation.

At this time, physical abilities increase to favor struggle and escape.

This was referred to as the fight-or-flight response.

So our bodies respond appropriately to the surrounding circumstances.

What would happen if a life-threatening situation occurred at night?

I couldn't protect my life because I was sleepy at night. This doesn't make sense.

So even if the surroundings are dark, if the brain is strongly focused on something,

It is designed to prevent sleep from coming in order to not disrupt that focus.

Because of that, the body feels tired and sleepy, but it becomes a situation where I can't sleep.

If you don't get enough sleep, insulin is released even if you don't eat.

Because insulin increases body fat.

Using a smartphone before bed can negatively affect your diet.

Mr. pkang, I'm in exactly that situation. What should I do?

You need to do three things.

The first thing is, of course, not to use your smartphone in bed.

If you must use your smartphone, please get up, turn on the light, and then use it.

If you have turned off the lights and laid down to sleep, you should not use your smartphone.

The second is to relax the tension in the body.

Right now, our bodies perceive that there is some urgent matter that prevents us from sleeping.

In this case, blood sugar levels rise in order to secure energy for urgent tasks.

Breathing becomes faster to secure oxygen for urgent tasks.

To quickly deliver the secured oxygen and energy throughout the entire body.

The heart rate increases.

This is the state of tension that arises from the fight-or-flight response.

You need to relieve this tension.

How do you relieve tension?

If you say you don't want to be nervous, can you avoid being nervous?

Among blood sugar, breathing, and heart rate, there are some that can be intentionally controlled.

It's 바로 breathing.

Because blood sugar, breathing, and heart rate are working in sync like gears.

If you intentionally stabilize even one thing, the rest will follow.

After intense exercise, your breathing becomes rapid and your heart rate increases.

If you remain still without regulating your breathing, it takes quite a long time for your heart rate to decrease.

When you intentionally breathe deeply and slowly, your heart rate decreases rapidly.

Similarly, if I intentionally breathe deeply and slowly,

As the tension eases, my body relaxes.

The last third is simplifying thoughts.

Even if the tension in the body has been released,

If you have a lot on your mind, your brain keeps working, and this can interfere with deep sleep.

In fact, just using our brains a lot can cause our bodies to experience stress.

When you experience stress, a fight-or-flight response occurs, causing your body to become tense.

But can you really avoid thinking just because you don't want to think?

Yes, that's right.

It's not easy to stop thinking.

So it's not about not thinking, but rather simplifying your thoughts.

The easiest way is to focus on your breathing.

Inhale deeply for one, exhale for two.

Try repeating this according to my breathing.

As you repeat this, other distracting thoughts will fade away.

This is quite helpful for a good night's sleep.

How about using a sleep mask or listening to white noise?

Such methods are also effective.

However, effective methods vary from person to person.

What is an effective method for someone can have the opposite effect on another person.

For example, there are people who sleep well while listening to the white noise of a campfire.

Some people have trouble sleeping.

Some people sleep well with a sleep mask, but...

Some people have trouble sleeping because they feel uncomfortable with something around their face.

Just because a method has worked for someone else doesn't mean it will necessarily be effective for me.

And having thoughts like, "I was told that if I do this, I would be able to sleep, so why can't I fall asleep??" is

It can also be a cause that prevents the simplification of thoughts and keeps you from falling asleep.

If I try a certain method and feel that it doesn't work for me,

It's not strange; it's just that the method doesn't suit me.

Don't be anxious; just find a method that works for you.
