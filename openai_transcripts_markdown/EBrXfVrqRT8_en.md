The reason for becoming a body type that gains weight on a low-calorie diet - Body type that doesn't gain weight, Part 4.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the fourth video about having a body type that doesn't gain weight.

In the first video, we talked about fat cells.

Body fat is stored in fat cells.

Having a large number of fat cells makes it easier to gain weight.

The number of these fat cells is determined in childhood and does not change after becoming an adult.

People who were obese in childhood tend to develop a body type that makes it easy to gain weight.

Once you become an adult, you cannot change this constitution.

There is a claim like this.

The background of this claim and the content of the video indicated that it is not true.

It might be because the video mentions that the number of fat cells can be reduced.

A question was raised in the comments about what to do to reduce the number of fat cells.

In this video, I would like to talk about fat cells.

The human body is made up of countless cells.

When this cell was first created, it was healthy and functionally without issues, but...

As time passes, cells age and problems with their function arise.

As the number of aging cells increases, it causes problems with the body's functions.

Aging cells are eliminated through cell death, and new cells are created through cell division.

In fact, human skin completely renews itself with new cells after four months.

Bones are completely replaced with new cells after seven years.

And this applies directly to muscle and body fat as well.

As cells are created and time passes, the aging of the cells progresses.

As time passes, aging cells are bound to occur.

Therefore, the decrease in the number of cells will inevitably lead to cell death.

However, the amount of cells that die is not always the same as the amount of cells that divide.

There are more dividing cells than dying cells, so the number of cells can increase.

The number of dying cells can exceed the number of dividing cells, leading to a decrease in the total number of cells.

A representative example of an increase in the number of cells is muscle growth, which occurs when muscle mass increases.

A representative example of a decrease in the number of cells is muscle loss, which is the reduction of muscle mass.

If you understand how muscle loss occurs,

You can also understand how to reduce the number of fat cells.

If you work out hard and put a strong load on your body,

In the process of overcoming that burden, the muscles gradually develop.

On the contrary, if you don't exercise and don't put a strong load on your body,

From the body's perspective, there is no need to maintain a lot of muscle, and as a result, muscle loss occurs.

If you starve yourself or follow a low-calorie diet, you will become low on energy.

Isn't muscle loss caused by using muscle as energy?

The idea that starving or following a low-calorie diet leads to a lack of energy in the body is

This means that the energy used for activities and exercise is also becoming insufficient.

In reality, if you starve yourself or follow a low-calorie diet, your body becomes weak, leading to a decrease in activity and exercise levels.

Since the level of activity and exercise has decreased like this,

There is no need to maintain a lot of muscle, which leads to muscle loss.

Energy is generated during the process of muscle loss.

When fasting or following a low-calorie diet, energy is gained from muscle loss.

This statement is not incorrect, but...

To gain energy, muscle loss does not occur, right?

Modern humanity finds it easy to obtain food, but

Early humans who obtained food through hunting and gathering found it quite difficult to acquire food.

So there were quite a few times when I couldn't find food and went hungry.

In such a situation, if the body actively breaks down muscle to gain energy,

Because the muscles have decreased, it has become more difficult to obtain food through hunting and gathering.

Then I will starve again, and my muscles will decrease even more.

Hunting and gathering will fall into a vicious cycle that becomes more difficult.

If a person's body were like this,

It is highly likely that ancient humanity could not overcome hunger and went extinct.

And I have body fat stored for the purpose of using it as emergency rations.

It is strange that the body breaks down muscle instead of fat to obtain energy.

So, it's not that muscle loss occurs in order to obtain insufficient energy.

When energy levels decrease, activity and exercise levels decline.

When physical activity and exercise decrease, muscles are not used effectively.

Since the muscles are not being used, they become unnecessary, leading to muscle loss.

Fat cells are the same.

If fat cells are not needed, the number of fat cells will decrease.

Many people choose low-calorie diets or fasting methods as a way to lose weight.

When the calories obtained from food become insufficient,

This is because people think that using body fat as energy leads to weight loss.

Let's think about it.

When you exercise and use your muscles, the need for those muscles increases, leading to their development.

So what happens if you starve yourself or follow a low-calorie diet to use body fat?

The necessity of body fat increases.

Of course, the number of fat cells does not decrease.

From the body's perspective, situations of starvation or following a low-calorie diet are circumstances where it is difficult to obtain food.

In such situations, it is essential to preserve body fat, which serves as emergency food, as much as possible for survival.

Even if you use it, you should use it sparingly.

When you eat food, you need to store as much of it as possible as body fat.

There is no reason to reduce fat cells that can store body fat.

So, if you follow a starvation diet or a low-calorie diet, you can lose weight by reducing body fat, but...

The number of fat cells does not decrease.

So there is a problem that it's easy to experience a yo-yo effect.

So what exactly am I supposed to do?

It's not about having to do something; it's about not doing it.

The reason muscles develop is because of exercise.

If you want to reduce muscle, you should avoid exercising, which is the reason for muscle development.

The reason body fat accumulates is because of eating processed foods.

If you want to reduce body fat, you should avoid processed foods.

The human body doesn't actually need this much body fat in the first place.

All living beings exist with the purpose of survival.

A body with a high amount of body fat has reduced activity levels, which is disadvantageous for survival.

A lot of body fat itself is not good for health.

So our body is trying to reduce body fat on its own.

However, the habit of frequently and excessively consuming processed foods is preventing this.

If you eat processed foods often and in large quantities, insulin is secreted frequently and in large amounts.

Insulin inhibits the burning of body fat.

Therefore, by not eating processed foods, you can prevent the unnecessary secretion of insulin.

It naturally reduces body fat and decreases the number of fat cells.

If you just stop here, there won't be any problems.

Going a bit further from here

If you starve yourself or follow a low-calorie diet, the number of fat cells does not decrease.

Misunderstanding the situation as one where food is hard to obtain, the fat cells think they are needed.

How to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods. Please refer to the video.

Try changing the types of food you eat.

Just by doing that, you can lose weight and reduce the number of fat cells.

You mentioned that fasting is not good, so is intermittent fasting also not good?

Since I don't eat processed foods, I definitely feel full even after eating just a little.

I’m eating just a little, so the calories I consume in a day are very low.

Is this becoming a low-calorie diet?

I'm worried that this might prevent fat cells from decreasing. Should I force myself to eat more?

To put it simply,

Intermittent fasting is different from starving if done correctly, so it is acceptable to practice it.

If you are not hungry, you don't have to force yourself to eat.

The reason for that is related to the absorption rate.

In the next video, let's talk about absorption rates and discuss this as well.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 5 of the body type that doesn't gain weight.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
