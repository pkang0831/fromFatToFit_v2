Hello, this is pkang.

This is the fifth video discussing intermittent fasting.

In Part 1 of the video, the basic principles of intermittent fasting are discussed.

In the second part of the video, we will discuss the reasons why some people find it difficult to adhere to fasting times.

In the third part of the video, the error in the claim that it is okay to binge eat as long as you stick to the fasting hours.

In Part 4 of the video, we explored why 16 hours of intermittent fasting is not effective for everyone.

In this video, we will talk about intermittent fasting and insulin.

Since the content of the video is all connected, it is recommended to watch them in order starting from Part 1.

If there is anyone who hasn't watched the previous video, please click the link that appears in the top right now.

It is recommended to watch the videos in order starting from the one at the front.

At the end of Part 4, there was a question about intermittent fasting and insulin.

When food is consumed, insulin is released, and since insulin inhibits the burning of body fat,

I understand that there needs to be a fasting period without eating food for dieting to be effective.

I was curious about how the same effects can occur even with shorter fasting periods.

First, when food is consumed, insulin is secreted, and this insulin inhibits the burning of fat.

This is a true story.

However, it is important to consider that the amount of food consumed affects the amount of insulin secreted.

So if you eat a lot of food, a lot of insulin will be secreted.

Excessive insulin secretion strongly inhibits the burning of body fat.

It takes a long time for insulin to stabilize.

However, if the amount of food consumed is small, the secretion of insulin is low.

Low insulin has a weak inhibitory effect on fat burning, and the time it takes for insulin to stabilize is short.

So if you eat a lot of food frequently, insulin is released often and in large amounts.

The burning of body fat may be suppressed, which can hinder dieting.

Even if you eat food frequently, if the amount you consume is small,

The low amount of insulin secretion does not hinder dieting.

I briefly mentioned it in the video of Part 3.

When eating foods with the same calories

Many experiments have been conducted comparing intermittent fasting to not fasting.

During that experiment, as shown in the third part of the video,

There are also experiments conducted in high-calorie situations where a large amount of calories is consumed in a day.

There are also experiments conducted in low-calorie situations where the amount of calories consumed is less than the daily metabolic rate.

Even if you eat a small amount of food, insulin is released.

This insulin definitely hinders dieting. For this claim to be true,

When comparing intermittent fasting with not fasting in a low-calorie situation.

Intermittent fasting should be more effective for reducing body fat.

This is probably because the fasting period is longer here.

However, many experiments like this have been conducted, but the results have not been consistent.

In several experiments, it was found that having three meals a day is actually more effective for reducing body fat.

There were also results that showed this.

In some experiments, intermittent fasting has been found to be more effective for reducing body fat.

There were also results that showed this.

In some experiments, the results showed no difference at all.

So the experimental results didn't come out consistently; they were mixed up and came out all jumbled.

The reason this is happening is that

The important variable that was intended to be confirmed in the experiment.

So, when there isn't much difference between whether you practiced intermittent fasting or not, this kind of result comes out.

Since there is no difference in the important variables, the error arises from other factors.

So, if you eat even a little bit of food, insulin is released.

This insulin does not interfere with dieting.

And this applies not only to the quantity of food but also to whether it is refined or unrefined.

Unrefined foods are digested and absorbed slowly, which means they lead to a lower secretion of insulin.

In summary, the amount of food consumed and whether it is refined or unrefined affects the amount of insulin secreted.

If the type of food consumed is unrefined or the amount of food is small, the secretion of insulin is low.

A small amount of insulin does not negatively affect dieting.

Without considering these points

Regardless of the type and amount of food consumed, insulin is always secreted when food is eaten.

If you think that insulin secretion means you can't lose weight at all, then...

I think that the act of eating food itself is wrong or...

Alternatively, one may fall into the misconception that the longer the fasting period, the better it is for dieting.

Actually, before the intermittent fasting series that I am currently creating,

If you look at the comments on the intermittent fasting video I made a while ago,

Whether the amount of food you eat is small or the food is unrefined, a diet that you eat frequently is...

You can never lose weight because of insulin.

A diet method that does not include fasting periods can never succeed.

There were quite a few people who wrote comments like this.

Without intentionally having fasting periods.

There are many people who have succeeded in dieting simply by changing their food to non-processed options.

Before intermittent fasting became popular, the method of eating small amounts frequently was often recommended.

In fact, there are many cases of people who successfully lost weight using such methods at that time.

However, when I talk about this,

I often ate food, and it made me crave it even more, so it was actually harder to control my appetite.

There are also people who say it like this.

On the contrary, after continuously having fasting periods, I ate food and then...

Suddenly, my appetite exploded, and I was eating way too much food.

Eating a little bit often made it easier to control my appetite. There are people like this, you know.

So this is just a difference in preference regarding which method is more favored.

There is no problem with the method itself.

So, having a longer fasting period doesn't necessarily mean better weight loss results?

Yes, that's right.

In the next video, I will talk about having a longer fasting period.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the intermittent fasting part 6 video,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
