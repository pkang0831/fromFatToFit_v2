I have successfully lost weight and am currently managing it well, but...

I am worried because I feel like I am always holding back on the food I have loved my whole life.

A story with this kind of content has been posted, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the story.

I watched all of pkang's videos and found them helpful, even watching some of them 5 or 6 times.

Although the weight is normal, it is classified as skinny obesity with high body fat.

It has been 7 months since I started my diet and exercise.

Muscle has gradually increased, and I've lost about 3 kg of body fat.

I was already on the slim side, so losing weight is very slow for me.

My body is changing very satisfactorily.

After changing the types of food I eat,

I am smoothly dieting for the first time in my life without feeling much hunger.

Thank you very much.

However, even after completely changing my diet and now being seven months in,

I always feel that the foods I have loved my whole life are always there for me.

Things like bread, snacks, macarons, and chocolate.

It's not unbearable, but I feel like I'm always quietly enduring.

Because of this, I've been feeling disillusioned about dieting lately.

My body is changing satisfactorily, and I'm enjoying the exercise without feeling hungry.

However, I feel a sense of reality hitting me.

I think it's a psychological issue, and I'm wondering what I should do about it.

This is a story with that content.

To put it simply, you can eat bread, snacks, macarons, and chocolate.

Eating that kind of food makes you gain weight, you know.

There is no food in this world that makes you gain weight if you eat it just once.

I am steadily, continuously, and increasingly eating more, which is causing me to gain weight.

I know that.

Isn't it true that once you start eating, you can't stop and end up eating a lot?

There are differences depending on the dieting method.

The most common dieting method usually involves restricting something.

By limiting the amount of food consumed, one can eat less or even fast completely.

Carbohydrates are sometimes restricted, or fats may be limited as well.

This type of diet has the problem of increasing cravings for food.

People need food, and they also need carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

In reality, if you follow a diet that severely restricts carbohydrates, your cravings for carbohydrate-rich foods will increase.

If you follow a diet that severely restricts fat, your cravings for greasy foods will increase.

When you eat less or skip meals, your desire for food increases.

When this desire grows to its limit and becomes unbearable, it ultimately explodes.

In this situation, I lose my reason and binge eat.

This is what is commonly referred to as having a loose mouth.

The problem is that it's an issue to forcefully hold back when you're hungry due to a lack of food and restrict nutrients.

However, the situation of the person sharing their story is completely different from this.

Whenever I talk about my diet

Do not limit the amount you eat or restrict nutrients.

They say to change the types of food you eat.

By doing so, you can eat less or not starve while not restricting nutrients.

It is because it helps with dieting.

If you actually look back at the story,

I am dieting smoothly without feeling much hunger.

I do have a desire to eat foods like bread, snacks, macarons, and chocolate, but...

That desire is not so strong that it cannot be resisted.

In this state, I don't lose my reason and binge eat.

But even if you don't binge eat all at once, won't you gradually end up eating more?

Such foods can significantly raise blood sugar levels.

When blood sugar levels rise significantly, a lot of insulin is released.

When a lot of insulin is released, it causes false hunger.

You said that eating more and more leads to obesity.

Yes, that's right.

However, in the case of the person sharing their story, it's okay because their body has changed due to dieting.

How does the body change?

There are two major changes.

The first is to suppress the rise in blood sugar.

When you eat sweet foods like bread, snacks, macarons, and chocolate,

As the amount of glucose in the blood increases, blood sugar levels rise.

This glucose is a source of glycogen, which is the energy for muscles.

A person who regularly exercises can store a lot of glycogen.

When eating the same food, blood sugar levels tend to rise less comparatively.

Glucose, which raises blood sugar, is stored as glycogen.

The second is the improvement of insulin resistance.

If blood sugar rises quickly and significantly, leading to a situation where a lot of insulin is released repeatedly,

Even with insulin, blood sugar levels do not decrease well.

It is resistance to insulin, and this is called insulin resistance.

When insulin resistance increases, more insulin is needed to perform the same tasks.

So, more insulin is produced.

On the contrary, if you consistently manage your diet to improve insulin resistance,

Because the body changes to respond sensitively to insulin.

You need less insulin to do the same work.

So, people who usually have low activity levels and exercise amounts, and have high insulin resistance,

It cannot suppress the rise in blood sugar levels.

Due to insulin resistance, more insulin is produced.

The fake hunger is severe and it's becoming a problem.

The person sharing their story experiences less of a spike in blood sugar even when eating the same food.

Insulin resistance has improved, so insulin is not produced in large amounts.

In this case, you may not experience false hunger even after eating bread, snacks, macarons, and chocolate.

Even if you eat the same food, your body's response can vary depending on its condition.

I will summarize.

Food is not just consumed for its taste or nutrients.

I eat it as a memory of that food.

Even if you are not hungry and do not lack nutrients,

Food that brings back good memories creates a desire to eat it again.

Suppressing this desire can sometimes lead to feelings of depression.

The person is craving it for psychological reasons, as they thought.

If you change the types of food you eat without eating less or starving, you can diet.

My body is gradually changing.

If your body changes, it may not be a problem to eat foods like bread, snacks, macarons, and chocolate.

So it's okay to eat.

If I say that I need to change the types of food I eat for my diet,

One of the common statements is that you can't maintain a diet for a lifetime.

It means that one cannot go a lifetime without eating foods like bread, snacks, macarons, and chocolate.

As mentioned earlier, food is also consumed through memories.

It is true that there are foods that I cannot resist for a lifetime because they remain good memories for me.

However, because of that, I need to create a body that can handle eating.

To achieve that, you need to adjust your diet and exercise.

To diet, I have to give up the foods I like.

Don't think like this.

I am dieting to create a body that won't gain weight even when I eat the foods I like.

So let's diet and eat comfortably.

I hope you think this way.

I used to explain the principles of dieting in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

While on a diet, I completely stopped eating sweet foods.

I felt dizzy after eating for the first time in a while. Why is that?

It is one of the reactions that occur as the body's metabolism returns to normal.

I made a detailed explanation video about this before.

I will make sure to display related videos in the upper right corner.

It seems that consistently exercising is also important.

I'm so busy and exhausted just with my daily life that I really don't have any time to exercise.

What should someone like me do?

This question came up before, and I made a video about it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

Mr. pkang, I have lower body obesity.
