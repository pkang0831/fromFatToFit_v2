Isn't reducing insulin as much as possible the fastest way to lose weight?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

A comment asking how to prevent insulin from being released has come up, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the comments.

I have watched a lot of diet-related videos on YouTube.

In the end, I thought that insulin was the problem.

I heard that the insulin hormone stores body fat and prevents the burning of body fat.

If insulin is not released, then body fat will not increase and will only be consumed.

Isn't it the fastest way to lose weight?

Please let me know if there is a way to prevent insulin from being released.

This is the kind of comment, so let's discuss it in detail.

First of all, it is true that insulin is a hormone that stores body fat.

The purpose of dieting is to reduce body fat.

From a dieting perspective, insulin can be seen as a bad hormone.

However, insulin itself is not bad.

Too much insulin does make us obese.

The issue at hand is

The problem is not the insulin itself, but that there is too much of it.

The human body is

If the heart doesn't beat, it dies.

The lungs die even if they don't breathe.

You can die even if your body temperature is not maintained.

For these organs to function and maintain body temperature, energy is required.

Because the heart keeps beating every moment, the lungs are breathing, and the body needs to maintain its temperature.

Energy is needed at every moment.

The most basic energy needed for sustaining life is called the basal metabolic rate.

Humans primarily obtain energy by consuming food.

The basal metabolic rate requires energy at every moment, but...

You can't keep eating food every moment.

So, some of the food I ate is stored in my body.

It is designed to be taken out and used during times when food is not being eaten.

This is the most basic metabolism of our body.

Insulin is a hormone that helps with this storage process.

If insulin is not released,

If we cannot store the energy obtained from food,

Because energy cannot be stored, body fat decreases.

Because energy cannot be stored, it becomes necessary to eat food frequently.

Is it possible to eat frequently and still lose body fat?

Isn't that actually a good thing?

Unfortunately, that's not the case.

The carbohydrates we eat are converted into glucose in the body.

It moves through the blood.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is called blood sugar.

When you consume carbohydrates, the amount of glucose in the blood increases.

Blood sugar levels rise.

Insulin stores this glucose in the body, helping to lower blood sugar levels.

If insulin is not released, blood sugar cannot be lowered.

It means that you won't be able to control your blood sugar.

This is diabetes, right?

In reality, type 1 diabetes is a condition where insulin is not produced properly.

There is a symptom of frequently eating food along with weight loss.

Without insulin, even if you eat frequently, you will lose weight.

The problem is that complications arise.

There could be problems with the brain that may lead to a stroke.

There could be a risk of losing my sight due to problems with my eyes.

There are cases where ulcers on the foot may require amputation.

In this case, the fact that eating frequently can reduce body fat becomes less important.

I understand that having no insulin at all is a problem.

But that's an extreme situation where insulin is not produced at all.

Not in such extreme situations, but in normal physical conditions.

Isn't it true that the less insulin is produced, the faster the weight loss occurs?

As I mentioned earlier, the problem is too much insulin.

Insulin itself is not the problem.

So, just because insulin levels are lower, it doesn't mean that dieting will happen faster.

The best way to minimize insulin secretion is to...

It is to reduce carbohydrate intake and increase fat intake.

Carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels, which induces the secretion of insulin.

Fat reduces the secretion of insulin.

The egg white is mostly made up of protein, and

The yolk contains fat.

If you only eat the egg whites, you will be consuming protein without any fat.

Eating the egg white and yolk together means consuming both fat and protein at the same time.

If we compare the insulin secretion levels of these two types,

Eating the egg white and yolk together results in lower insulin levels.

Fat reduces the secretion of insulin.

So, eat as few carbohydrates as possible to avoid raising blood sugar and triggering insulin release.

If you eat as much fat as possible, it will reduce insulin.

It will be a diet that suppresses insulin as much as possible.

There is actually a diet like this.

However, there are a few problems with this diet.

Insulin can also increase body fat.

Store glucose as glycogen, which is the energy needed for exercise and activities.

It also helps in the use of proteins for muscle synthesis.

When there is a shortage of insulin,

Due to a lack of glycogen, the level of activity and exercise will decrease.

Since it doesn't lead to muscle synthesis, the muscle mass will also decrease.

When the level of activity, exercise, and muscle mass decreases,

As the energy consumed by the body decreases, dieting becomes more difficult.

On the contrary, gaining weight becomes easier, which increases the likelihood of experiencing yo-yo dieting.

The more you reduce insulin, the faster the diet does not become.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First, we need energy at every moment.

Because we cannot eat food at every moment.

Some of the energy obtained from food is stored.

It is designed to be taken out and used during the time when food is not being eaten.

One of the hormones that stores energy at this time is called insulin.

If there is no second insulin hormone.

Because energy cannot be stored, body fat does not increase.

Because energy cannot be stored, you need to eat frequently.

You will be unable to maintain your exercise volume, activity level, and muscle mass.

If you frequently eat the third type of food and do not maintain your exercise, activity level, and muscle mass,

If the diet is not going well or

Even when dieting, the problem of easily experiencing a yo-yo effect arises.

I can organize it like this.

The most important thing in dieting is balance.

If you have gained weight because you ate too much food,

It's not that you have to starve without eating food.

You should eat in moderation.

If you have gained weight due to excessive insulin production.

It is not about minimizing insulin production as much as possible.

It needs to come out just right.

This way, you will feel full for a longer time and won't want to snack.

As your activity level, exercise amount, and muscle mass increase, you lose weight and also prevent rebound weight gain.

This is the fastest way to lose weight.

If you cannot maintain your exercise level, activity level, and muscle mass.

I understand that a yo-yo can come.

You can exercise after losing weight, right?

The problem is that I'm not losing weight.

The body fat in our body is divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat located right next to the organs.

Subcutaneous fat is the fat located beneath the skin.

The only place in our body where the internal organs are located is the abdomen.

The fat on the sides, back, arms, and thighs, excluding the belly, is all subcutaneous fat.

What we commonly refer to as fat is all subcutaneous fat.

Losing visceral fat is effective with diet, but

Reducing subcutaneous fat is important for exercise volume, activity level, and muscle mass.

In the past, no matter how little I ate, I couldn't lose weight.

We talked in detail about visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

I understand that I shouldn't diet in extreme ways.

So how should I go about dieting?

I explained the principles of dieting in detail before.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right corner.

A diet that severely restricts carbohydrates and includes a lot of fats is

Are you talking about a low-carb, high-fat diet?

Are you saying not to follow a low-carb, high-fat diet because there are issues with it?

A low-carb, high-fat diet does not refer to a single diet.

It refers to a diet where the calories obtained from fat are greater than those obtained from carbohydrates.

It is close to a single concept, and there are various types of diets included within that concept.

There is also a diet that drastically restricts carbohydrates while allowing for the maximum intake of fats.

While it's advised to reduce carbohydrates, there are also diets that do not restrict them.

It's not that you should eat less fat, but there are diets that suggest you don't need to force yourself to eat a lot.

This is a message to avoid extreme diets among the various options available.

There were many questions about the low-carb, high-fat diet before, so I made a video about it.
