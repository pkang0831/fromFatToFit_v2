I've been digesting really well these days... Does that mean I won't be able to lose weight?

All videos have subtitles.

If my digestion is very good, will that prevent me from dieting or cause me to gain weight?

A question with this kind of content has come up, so I would like to discuss it a bit.

The reason we become obese is that we eat too much food.

It's because the food has been digested and absorbed, allowing many nutrients to enter the body.

The processed foods that actually make us obese are

It is transformed into a form that is easy to digest and absorb during the processing.

For example, when you grind wheat into a powder, it becomes flour.

The noodles and bread made by re-kneading this flour are

It can easily break down because it was made into powder and then reformed.

Because it is easy to break down, it is also easy to digest.

On the contrary, the foods that are said to be good for dieting are unprocessed foods.

Because it has not been processed, it does not decompose easily.

Because it does not easily decompose, digestion is also not easy.

In simple terms, foods that are difficult to digest and absorb are good for dieting.

The human body adapts to the environment.

If you consistently eat such foods, your body will adapt and your digestive ability will improve.

So, I've been consistently eating unprocessed foods, and it seems like my body has adapted to it, making digestion really easy.

If that's the case, won't eating unprocessed food still prevent weight loss?

A question with this kind of content has been posted.

That's an interesting question. Let me elaborate on it.

The reason why foods that are difficult to digest and absorb are said to be good for dieting is

Due to difficulties in digestion and absorption, the amount absorbed by the body is less when consuming the same quantity.

This is partly because the insulin hormone that increases body fat is produced in smaller amounts.

The act of eating such foods itself can create a dieting effect.

If you are someone interested in dieting,

You may have heard that chewing food thoroughly is good for dieting.

The chewing motion of food affects the brain and makes you eat slowly.

In order for a person to feel full after eating, a hormone called leptin needs to be released.

For this leptin to be secreted, it must send a signal to the brain that food is being consumed.

It takes time for leptin to be secreted.

The chewing motion of food can serve as a signal that one is eating.

If you exercise a lot and eat slowly, you will give your body time to release leptin.

Simply put, people who eat quickly without properly chewing their food are

Before the leptin hormone is released and a feeling of fullness occurs, overeating happens.

It means that you will stop doing that.

If you eat food that is not processed, it can be difficult to digest and absorb.

I naturally engage in a lot of exercise and eat my food slowly.

Because it's difficult to digest and absorb in the first place, you need to chew your food a lot.

If you put a large amount in your mouth at once, it becomes difficult to chew properly.

It's because I take small bites of food and chew a lot.

On the other hand, foods that are not good for dieting are those that are quickly digested and absorbed.

Because the food itself is soft.

Even if you put a large amount in your mouth at once, it's not difficult to chew.

It quickly turns into a mushy texture even without chewing much.

A typical example is the noodles and bread made from flour that I mentioned earlier.

Noodles and bread are made from wheat that has been ground into flour and then reformed.

It is very soft and quickly turns into a mush with just a few chews.

In reality, it is quite common for people to put a mouthful of noodles in their mouths and swallow without chewing them a few times.

So when eating noodle dishes, should you take small bites or chew a lot?

No, that's not the case.

It turns into something like mush without needing to be chewed many times, trying to go down the throat.

Forcing it and continuing to chew on it.

I want to eat a lot at once, but it's really difficult to intentionally eat just a little bit at a time.

It's not just something you do once or twice; you have to keep doing it every time you eat.

There is no one who can do that.

It's frustrating and suffocating, and it only adds to my stress, which makes my diet even worse.

And even if you force it, it doesn't really have much effect.

The chewing movement refers to the act of chewing food.

Therefore, it is effective to chew your food.

It has already been chewed and turned into porridge, so there is nothing left to chew.

Just pretending to chew it doesn't make it meaningful.

So, it's not about trying hard to chew food that turns into mush after just a few bites.

It means that you need to eat foods that require a lot of chewing in the first place.

Meatballs made by grinding actual meat.

Noodle dishes made with flour, even for those who don't chew much,

When eating steak or vegetables, I chew quite a lot.

I thought I should chew a lot, so it's not that I'm intentionally chewing a lot.

You have to chew a lot in order to swallow, so naturally, you end up chewing a lot.

So... to summarize,

Processed foods are very easy to digest and absorb, which is why we become obese.

Reducing the intake of such foods is helpful for dieting.

Simply put, foods that are harder to digest and absorb compared to processed foods are better for dieting.

Because of the saying that foods that are difficult to digest and absorb are good for dieting.

Some people mistakenly believe that not digesting food is good for dieting.

So, when food is digested well after eating, one might fall into the illusion that it won't lead to weight loss, right?

Foods that are difficult to digest and absorb have a dieting effect simply by consuming them.

You need to do a lot of chewing exercises.

So, I end up eating slowly.

This induces the secretion of the satiety hormone leptin, which helps prevent overeating.

Reasons for obesity include frequently eating large amounts of food.

This is because the food that has been overeaten is digested and absorbed, leading to a large amount of nutrients entering the body.

So, if you don't overeat, there won't be any problems even if digestion and absorption are good.

Rather, it is better for digestion to absorb the vitamins and minerals abundant in unrefined foods into the body.

It is more helpful for dieting.

So if you eat unrefined foods, there's no need to worry just because they digest well.

It is actually a good phenomenon.

I am a student, and since I eat school meals, all my friends eat the same food.

There are friends who eat quickly and friends who eat slowly.

Why is there such a difference when we eat the same food?

Chewing food thoroughly naturally leads to eating slowly, but...

To eat slowly, it is not necessary to chew a lot.

For example, if I cook, there will be food to eat.

However, just because I have food to eat doesn't necessarily mean that I cooked it myself.

It could have been made by someone else, ordered for delivery, or brought home.

If you chew your food a lot in the same concept, you will naturally eat slowly.

To eat slowly, it is not necessary to chew food excessively.

In reality, the speed at which we eat is influenced more by other factors than by the number of times we chew our food.

In a moment, three videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have a video about the speed of eating in the top left.

Earlier, when you were wrapping up, you mentioned that vitamins and minerals are helpful for dieting.

So, can we say that taking diet supplements or nutritional supplements is helpful for dieting?

This is a frequently asked question, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

I heard that unrefined foods are good for dieting.

What exactly is that?

I recently made a video that completely covers unrefined foods.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

You can choose and watch the video that you need from the three options.
