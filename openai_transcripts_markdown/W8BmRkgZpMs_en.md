How to eat ramen, a fattening food, without gaining weight.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitle feature.

Recently, a question with this content was posted in the comments.

pkang, I am planning to eat ramen after starting my diet a few months ago.

In Ronka's videos,

There are many videos that teach how to eat the same food in a way that minimizes weight gain as much as possible.

If you use all those methods, it seems like you would gain less weight than just eating ramen.

Could you summarize the best ways to gain the least amount of weight?

That's quite an interesting question.

So based on the content of a few videos,

I would like to talk about how to eat ramen without gaining weight.

The content of the video is about ramen, but it can also be applied to other foods.

If you want to eat ramen without gaining weight,

You need to understand why eating ramen can lead to weight gain.

I talked about how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight in the video. (There is a video link in the top right corner.)

Processed foods like ramen quickly and significantly raise blood sugar levels.

When blood sugar rises quickly and significantly, a large amount of insulin is secreted to lower the blood sugar.

Insulin has the effect of increasing body fat.

When insulin is secreted in large amounts, body fat increases significantly, leading to obesity.

Therefore, if you want to eat ramen without gaining weight, you need to minimize the rise in blood sugar as much as possible.

So, what can be done to suppress the rise in blood sugar?

Let me tell you about this in order.

The choice of the first ramen.

If you make and eat foods that are supposed to help you lose weight in this way, you will gain weight. I mentioned this in the video. (There is a video link in the top right corner.)

Foods cooked at high temperatures tend to raise blood sugar levels quickly.

So, when you steam sweet potatoes and eat them, they are a food that helps with weight loss, but...

It was said that if you fry it in an air fryer, it becomes food that makes you gain weight.

Ramen basically uses fried noodles made from deep-fried dough.

Recently, there are also dried noodle products that are made without frying, using hot air instead.

Dried noodles cook at a lower temperature than fried noodles.

Therefore, dried noodles raise blood sugar levels more slowly than fried noodles.

Choosing instant noodles that are classified as dry noodles can help reduce the speed at which blood sugar levels rise.

However, there is quite a difference in taste.

So I want to taste the original flavor of ramen.

People like this should choose fried noodles.

It's okay if the taste is a bit different; I just hope my blood sugar doesn't rise too much.

People like this can choose dry noodles.

If you look at the back of the ramen, it indicates whether it is fried noodles or non-fried noodles.

You can choose after looking at that.

How to cook the second ramen.

I talked about foods that are not fattening but are misunderstood as fattening in the video. (There is a video link in the top right corner.)

For insulin to be secreted in large amounts, blood sugar must rise quickly and significantly.

For blood sugar to rise quickly, digestion and absorption must be fast.

For blood sugar to rise significantly, there needs to be a high content of carbohydrates.

Conversely, even if digestion and absorption are quick, it's fine if the carbohydrate content is low.

Even if the carbohydrate content is high, it can be acceptable if digestion and absorption are slow.

In reality, fruits are quickly digested and absorbed, but they have a high water content, which results in a low carbohydrate content.

So it's possible to diet by eating only fruits.

On the contrary, an example of food that has a high carbohydrate content but is digested and absorbed slowly is brown rice.

Brown rice is a food that has a high carbohydrate content, similar to white rice.

However, because it has a shell, digestion and absorption are slow.

So just by switching from white rice to brown rice, you can lose weight.

Looking at the nutritional information of ramen, the carbohydrate content is quite high at 80g.

Because it is made by frying flour, it is very quickly digested and absorbed.

So ramen is a food that makes you gain weight.

If you reduce the carbohydrate content and slow down the digestion rate,

Eating ramen will likely result in less weight gain, right?

First, a way to reduce the carbohydrate content is to cook only half a serving of ramen.

Just doing this will reduce the carbohydrates by half.

The problem of insufficient quantity can be resolved by adding vegetables like bean sprouts, green onions, and mushrooms and boiling them together.

The problem is that I want to eat ramen, but I can only eat half of the noodles.

The question remains: how do we deal with the leftover half of the ramen?

Let's think that we can just boil it next time.

I have to eat the ramen that I intended to eat only once, twice.

Even if I think about eating it twice, there is no soup.

So it's okay to eat only half of the ramen.

I can handle about half a pack of ramen on my own.

People like this should boil half a pack of ramen together with vegetables.

Since I've decided to eat ramen, I just want to fully enjoy one bowl of it.

People like this can just boil one.

They said it's okay to choose fried noodles instead of steamed noodles.

You said that it's okay to cook one whole ramen instead of just half.

Is it really okay?

It is best not to eat ramen in the first place.

However, I have already decided to eat ramen.

In that case, since you're going to eat anyway, it's better to eat in a way that provides high satisfaction.

Otherwise, I regret it after eating.

Can I add eggs?

You can put it in.

Protein also has the effect of slowing down the rise in blood sugar levels.

How to eat the third bowl of ramen.

From here on, there are no options. You must follow it without exception.

If the amount of ramen added determines the carbohydrate content,

How you eat ramen can affect digestion and absorption.

To slow down digestion and absorption, you can add vegetables.

The dietary fiber in vegetables can interfere with digestion.

So how do you eat this vegetable?

You can enjoy it with balsamic dressing.

Balsamic dressing is a dressing made by mixing balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

As mentioned in the vinegar series, (there is a video link in the top right corner).

Vinegar has the effect of suppressing the rise in blood sugar levels.

Olive oil also has the effect of suppressing blood sugar spikes.

You only talk about blood sugar, but isn't the high sodium content in ramen also a problem?

Yes, that's right. Sodium is also a problem.

The sodium in ramen is mostly found in the broth.

If you don't drink the broth, your sodium intake will significantly decrease.

And because vegetables have the effect of expelling sodium,

If you eat it with a vegetable salad and try not to drink the broth as much as possible,

You don't need to worry too much about the sodium issue.

After eating the last fourth ramen, please walk for about 30 minutes right away.

I talked about it in the post-meal exercise series (there's a video link in the top right).

When we eat food,

As the number of glucose in the blood increases, blood sugar levels rise.

However, if you walk right at this time, you will use glucose as energy for walking.

It has the effect of suppressing the rise in blood sugar levels.

Actually, after walking for 30 minutes post-meal,

There have been experiments where blood sugar levels were suppressed, resulting in a weight loss of 3 kg in a month.

I will summarize.

When choosing ramen, opt for dried noodles rather than fried noodles.

When boiling ramen, it's better to cook half a pack rather than a whole one.

I really want to eat the ramen I had before.

People like this can choose fried noodles, and you can boil them all at once.

Eating one bowl of ramen won't suddenly make you gain a few kilograms anyway.

It's something I always say, but...

Weight doesn't suddenly gain or lose.

The reason I gained weight is that I have been eating processed foods for a long time.

It's not like that happened just because I ate one ramen.

It is best not to eat it in the first place.

If you've decided to eat it, you shouldn't regret it afterwards.

If you have cooked ramen, enjoy it with a salad drizzled with balsamic dressing.

After finishing the ramen, please walk or engage in some activity for about 30 minutes.

Doing it this way is much better for your diet than just eating ramen.
