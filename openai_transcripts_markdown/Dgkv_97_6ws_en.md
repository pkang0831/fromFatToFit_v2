If you're on a diet but find snacks too delicious, try this.

A comment asking how to handle cravings for snacks while on a diet has been posted.

I am discussing the reasons for wanting to eat snacks while on a diet and how to cope with it.

In the first and second videos, the issue of meal composition is discussed.

The third video addresses the issue of chewing cravings.

In the fourth video, we talked about the issue of basal metabolic rate.

Completely unrelated to this, there was a comment saying that the snacks are delicious.

In this video, I will talk about the taste of snacks.

Many people try to avoid eating salt and sugar as much as possible when they are on a diet.

The reason for trying to avoid eating salt is

The awareness that a low-sodium diet is necessary when dieting has spread since some point in time.

The reason for trying not to eat sugar is

It's because sweet foods raise blood sugar levels and lead to obesity.

As a result, the diet consists of very bland food without sweetness or saltiness.

If you have been frequently eating refined foods like sweet and salty snacks,

A bland diet is hard to eat.

The reason is simple: it's because it doesn't taste good.

In Korea, children are not allowed to eat snacks before their meals.

The reason is that after eating sweet and salty snacks, rice tastes bland.

A similar example is a course meal.

In a course meal, it starts with dishes that have mild flavors and gradually progresses to dishes with stronger flavors.

If you eat strong-flavored food first, you won't be able to taste anything from the milder food.

If you usually eat sweet and salty foods and then switch to a bland diet plan,

When the food doesn't taste good, I feel a desire to eat something sweet and salty.

Sweet and salty food is just like snacks.

So you can say that the desire for snacks has increased.

The cause of the problem is not consuming sugar and salt.

Adding salt and sugar to the diet will solve the problem.

But if you add salt and sugar, won't that prevent weight loss?

You can add salt and sugar. The important thing is the amount you add.

When there is information about dieting, it is often interpreted in an extreme way.

If it is said that eating too much salt is not good for dieting,

I try to avoid eating salt altogether.

If it's said that consuming too much sugar is not good for dieting,

I try not to eat any sugar at all.

However, it is said that eating too much food is not good for dieting.

Not eating at all and continuously starving yourself is not the best way to diet.

Similarly, it is true that consuming too much salt and sugar is not good for dieting, but

That said, completely avoiding salt and sugar is not the best diet.

In fact, overly restricting salt and sugar may not be good for your diet.

I talked in detail about salt in the video [Why Diet Foods Are Tasteless and Solutions].

I talked about sugar in the video titled [Is Sugar Absolutely Forbidden When Dieting? Not Really].

There are two video links appearing in the top right now.

If you would like more details, you can click to see them.

If you refer to that video, you can create your meal plan.

Because there is sweetness and saltiness in the diet, it is not difficult to stick to the diet itself.

Because both sweetness and saltiness are satisfied, it can reduce the desire for snacks.
