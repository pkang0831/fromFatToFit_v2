I heard that onions induce insulin secretion... Will eating them make me gain weight?

A question about onions and insulin has been posted in the comments.

I understood that onions are a food that helps with dieting.

I found out that onions promote insulin secretion, which is good for blood sugar control.

I understand that insulin increases body fat, so it is known as a fattening hormone.

If onions promote the secretion of insulin, doesn't that mean eating onions will make you gain weight?

Why is onion said to be good for dieting?

It can be a situation that is quite confusing, right?

I will talk about it in detail.

The reference point is very important.

For example, when talking about the number 2,

If we take 1 as a reference, then 2 would be a large number.

However, if you use 3 as a reference, it becomes a small number.

The number 2 itself does not change, but the story varies depending on the reference point.

So when interpreting any information, you need to check the reference point of that information.

Insulin is a hormone that lowers blood sugar levels.

If insulin is produced in excess compared to blood sugar, it can lead to the problem of blood sugar dropping too low.

If insulin is produced in too small an amount compared to blood sugar, it can lead to the problem of blood sugar not decreasing.

Remember the content up to this point.

If we take another look at the discussion about onions and insulin that came up in the question,

It was said that onions promote the secretion of insulin, which helps with blood sugar control.

So, the result is that onions promote the secretion of insulin, leading to an increase in insulin production.

It's not that the blood sugar has dropped too low, but rather that it has helped with blood sugar control.

For this story to hold, there must be a lack of insulin in the absence of onions.

In a situation where it is difficult to control blood sugar due to a lack of insulin,

It means that onions, which promote insulin secretion, can help with blood sugar control.

So, it means that onions can be helpful for people who have diabetes symptoms and do not produce insulin well.

In fact, behind the story that onions promote insulin secretion and help with blood sugar control is

There are claims that it has effects in preventing diabetes or that it helps with diabetes.

So, onions do promote the secretion of insulin, but...

That level is only somewhat helpful in a situation where insulin is severely lacking.

Insulin is becoming too much.

It doesn't mean that gaining body fat leads to obesity because of that.

If a large amount of insulin is released when eating onions, to the extent that it increases body fat,

When foods that do not raise blood sugar levels significantly are eaten together with onions.

Blood sugar is not high, but insulin is being produced in excess.

There are side effects of hypoglycemia symptoms, such as blood sugar dropping too low.

When you eat onions, there should be a phenomenon where body fat increases.

In reality, that's not the case.

Rather, the other components of onions are helpful for dieting.

There are many experiments that show eating onions or onion juice has a dieting effect.

That's why onions are said to be good for dieting.

Hmm... But insulin is a hormone that increases body fat.

I hope that insulin is not released as much as possible.

And the ingredients that are good for dieting in certain foods are also found in other foods.

You said that there isn't a specific food that you must eat for dieting, right?

So I plan to stop eating onions from now on.

Yes, that's right.

One of the reasons onions are good for dieting is because of a component called quercetin.

This ingredient is not only found in onions.

Because it is also found in asparagus, strawberries, apples, kale, spinach, and red grapes.

It is not necessary to eat onions for dieting.

If you like onions and want to eat them, you can go ahead and eat them.

A person who dislikes onions doesn't have to force themselves to eat onions for the sake of dieting.

However, there is a need to improve the awareness of insulin a bit.

Insulin actually works to increase body fat.

So it is true that high insulin levels are a cause of obesity.

Because of this, it is important to ensure that insulin does not spike too much during a diet.

They say that insulin should be produced in smaller amounts.

Because of this story, there are cases where people think of insulin itself as a devil.

The problem is not insulin itself, but rather having too much insulin.

In fact, to properly diet, an appropriate amount of insulin is necessary.

Why is insulin necessary?

Insulin stores glucose in the blood as body fat or

The fat we eat is stored as body fat.

Sometimes, I also engage in activities that increase body fat.

Store the glucose in the blood as glycogen, which is the energy source for muscles, or

It also helps in the use of protein for muscle synthesis.

So without insulin, there is a lack of glycogen, and the muscles cannot exert strength.

Because the muscles are unable to exert strength, the level of activity decreases, and it becomes difficult to exercise properly.

Even if you force yourself to exercise, protein won't be used for muscle synthesis, so your muscles won't grow.

In fact, among diet plans, there are those that aim to suppress insulin as much as possible.

There is a diet that severely restricts carbohydrate intake and intentionally includes a lot of fat.

One of the side effects of this diet is lethargy.

Because I intentionally eat a lot of fat, the total calories I consume are high.

Even if you consume a lot of calories, a lack of carbohydrates and insulin can lead to lethargy.

When lethargy leads to a decrease in activity and exercise, it is naturally not good for dieting.

They say that dieting is 70% diet and 30% exercise.

Diet is much more important than exercise.

I don't really want to exercise, so I don't think it would matter if I say I can't.

And I saw on the internet that...

People who lose weight through exercise say that if they stop exercising, they experience a rebound effect.

I don't have the confidence to exercise for a lifetime, so I'm just planning to diet without working out.

If one of the purposes of dieting is

If your goal is to achieve a slim and beautiful body for cosmetic purposes, you should not do that.

The fat in the human body is divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the type of fat that effectively decreases when following a diet, but

Subcutaneous fat is not easily lost through diet and is the type of fat that decreases when you exercise.

The only place in our entire body where the internal organs are located is deep inside the abdomen.

The sagging belly fat, arm fat, thigh fat, and back fat are all subcutaneous fat.

If you want to have a slim body, you need to reduce that subcutaneous fat.

Therefore, exercise is necessary.

In a moment, two videos will appear on the screen.

I will set it up so that a video about subcutaneous fat appears on the left.

What is the difference between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat?

Why is it necessary to exercise in order to reduce body fat?

What kind of exercise should I do to lose body fat?

Since we talked in detail,

If you're curious about subcutaneous fat, you can select the video on the left to watch.

And on the right, there are people who gain weight when they stop exercising; why is that?

I will make a video discussing how to solve that problem.

If you're curious about that part, you can select and watch the video on the right.
