How to Drink Water for Weight Loss - Water Diet Part 4

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the fourth video about the water diet.

In the first video, we discuss the cold water diet.

In the second video, it discusses the feeling of fullness from water.

In the third video, we talked about the warm water diet.

In this video, I will talk about how and how much water you should drink.

There is a saying that you should drink more than 2 liters of water a day.

So, for those who are trying to drink water for health or dieting purposes,

It is common to aim to drink 2 liters of water a day.

If you actually look on YouTube, there are many videos about drinking 2 liters of water.

I tried drinking 2 liters of water each day for three days.

I tried drinking 2 liters of water every day for a week.

I tried drinking 2 liters of water every day for a month. There are many videos like this.

In that video, I try to drink as much water as possible at once.

And I go to the bathroom very often.

To gain health or diet benefits from drinking water,

The water you drink needs to be absorbed by the body and utilized.

However, even though I drank more water than usual, if I just end up going to the bathroom that much, then...

Does this really have a positive effect on health or dieting?

It's hard to see it that way.

If you want to drink water for health or dieting purposes, you need to drink it in a way that allows your body to absorb it.

To absorb water into your body, you should drink it little by little and frequently.

Then why do the people in that video drink so much at once?

If you don't drink a lot at once, you can't drink 2 liters of water in a day.

Let's think about it.

To ensure that water is absorbed by the body, you should drink small amounts frequently.

If you drink a little bit often, you won't be able to drink 2 liters of water in a day.

To drink 2 liters of water a day, you need to drink as much as possible at once.

If you drink as much as possible at once, the water doesn't get properly absorbed by the body.

So, it's very difficult to ensure that 2 liters of water is absorbed by the body in a day.

Then, the claim that a person needs 2 liters of water a day has some issues.

There was a research report in the past stating that the average amount of body water a person loses in a day is 2 liters.

Based on that report, the saying that one should drink 2 liters of water a day has spread.

However, there are two errors here.

The first error is that the average amount of body water lost in a day is "2 liters."

In the first place, everyone is different.

Body types vary depending on height and weight.

A person with a larger physique naturally loses more body water than a person with a smaller physique.

The amount of body water lost through sweat varies depending on the level of activity and exercise.

The amount of body water lost through urine and feces varies depending on the frequency of bathroom visits.

So, the amount of body water lost varies from person to person.

When I calculated the average of this, it turned out to be about 2 liters.

Applying this average value directly to everyone is obviously incorrect.

The second error is that there is not just one way to obtain body water, which is by drinking water.

As mentioned in the last video, the food we eat also contains moisture.

You can replenish your body fluids by eating food, not just by drinking water.

Used body moisture is sometimes recycled.

During the process of burning body fat, water is also produced.

So even if the amount of body water lost in a day is actually 2 liters,

You don't have to drink 2 liters of water.

So, how much water should you drink in a day?

If you change the way you drink water, you'll naturally come to know it.

How should I drink water?

Keep water close by, and you can drink it whenever you want.

Modern society is very busy and has many stimulating situations.

As a result, there are cases where menstrual cycles get delayed.

For example, when playing a game, you might want to go to the bathroom, but...

Since the game is in progress, there are times when I can't go right away.

In this case, I think I should go to the bathroom after the game ends.

For now, let's focus on the game.

However, when you focus on the game, the urge to go to the bathroom gets pushed to the back.

Sometimes, even after the game is over, there are cases where people do not go to the bathroom.

Being exposed to the strong stimulation of games and focusing on them suppresses physiological phenomena.

This is not only the case in games.

It happens the same way when I'm focused on studying or working.

It applies the same way to thirst.

I have developed a thirst and want to drink water.

When you are focused on something, thirst gets pushed to the back and is forgotten.

That's why people don't drink a lot of water.

However, if I leave water within reach, my thirst doesn't go away.

So even if I don't intentionally try to drink a lot of water,

I drink water more often than I thought.

And at this time, the water you drink is not a lot; you only take a few sips, just one or two.

In this case, you will drink water a little bit frequently.

The amount of water I drink has increased, but I don't go to the bathroom often.

Because water is well absorbed by the body, it has beneficial effects on health and dieting.

And the amount of water I drink like this is the amount of water my body needs.

There's no need to think that you have to drink a certain number of liters and to make an effort for that.

In the third part of the video, you mentioned that drinking warm water is good for dieting, right?

However, if you keep warm water next to you and drink it little by little, it cools down quickly.

What should I do in this situation?

You can use a cup with insulation features.

If you purchase a product that costs around 10,000 to 20,000 won, it will keep the water warm for about 5 to 6 hours.

Whenever I drink when I want to, I end up drinking just the right amount my body needs.

I understand this, but...

Still, I’m worried that there might not be enough water, or that I might be drinking too much.

Is there a way to check if the water I am drinking is too much or too little?

You can check the color of your urine.

If the color of your urine is dark yellow, it means that you are dehydrated.

The clearer and more colorless the urine becomes, the more it means that there is too much water.

You can adjust the amount of water you drink by observing the color of your urine.

I want to drink warm water, but...

Can't I just drink coffee instead because the warm water has a smell?

In the next video, we will talk about drinking coffee instead of water.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not part 5 of the water diet,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
