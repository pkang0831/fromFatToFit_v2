Reasons for not wanting to exercise while dieting.

Hello, this is pkang.

This is part 2 of the video about reasons for not wanting to exercise.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about reasons for not wanting to exercise, specifically related to weight.

So, I focused on discussing severe obesity, which involves a significant amount of weight.

There are people who do not want to exercise even among those who are not severely obese.

In this video, I would like to talk about this kind of person.

People who are not severely obese but do not want to exercise often have dietary issues as the cause.

In the case of someone who is not severely obese but exercises for the purpose of dieting,

Since the goal is to lose weight, I am trying to limit the calories and carbohydrates in my diet.

This kind of diet makes you dislike exercising.

"If you follow a low-calorie diet that lacks calories, your basal metabolic rate will decrease."

If you are someone interested in dieting, you may have heard this story at least once.

Basal metabolic rate refers to the energy used by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

It refers to the energy that is continuously used 24 hours a day to sustain life.

The energy a person consumes in a day is not just based on their basal metabolic rate.

In addition to the basal metabolic rate, there are also the active metabolic rate and the exercise metabolic rate.

Exercise metabolic rate refers to the energy expended during physical activity.

The active metabolic rate refers to the energy expended during activities, not just exercise.

If you follow a low-calorie diet and end up with a calorie deficit,

Which of these three types of energy does our body try to reduce first?

It is the metabolic rate during exercise.

Basal metabolic rate is necessary for maintaining life.

Since I engage in activities like attending school or going to work, I also need to consider my activity energy expenditure.

Even if you don't exercise, there isn't an immediate problem.

So, I am trying to lower my exercise metabolism, but this manifests as a reluctance to exercise.

Simply put, because I'm eating little, I don't have the energy to exercise and I don't want to move.

In a low-calorie diet, the decrease in exercise metabolism and activity metabolism occurs first.

Then, the basal metabolic rate will decrease.

In that case, while following a low-calorie diet, increase your exercise and activity level.

If you maintain your exercise metabolism and activity metabolism, can you prevent your basal metabolic rate from decreasing?

No, that's not the case.

To make it easier to understand, for example,

Calories are like a salary.

Basal metabolic rate is the amount of energy needed for basic life functions.

Exercise metabolism and activity metabolism are not living expenses, but rather refer to the money I spend for my enjoyment.

It would be money for meeting friends or going on a trip.

My salary has decreased, so I am in a situation where I need to save money.

So I didn't meet any friends and didn't go on any trips.

Still, due to a lack of money, I am in a situation where I need to cut back on living expenses.

In this situation, meeting friends, spending money, and traveling cannot be a solution.

Rather, since money has been spent in that direction, a situation will arise where living expenses need to be reduced even further.

Ultimately, the problem is caused by a lack of calories corresponding to the salary.

You can only solve the problem by increasing your calorie intake.

And this applies not only to calories but also to carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates serve as the source of glycogen, which is the energy for muscles.

Even on a low-carbohydrate diet, there can be a reluctance to exercise.

In a ketogenic diet that severely restricts carbohydrates,

Even if you consume enough calories, side effects like lethargy can still occur.

If the calories and carbohydrates in your diet are too low, please try to increase them.

But if you increase carbohydrates and calories, won't you gain weight again?

It depends on the type of food being eaten.

If you approach dieting solely from the perspective of nutrients,

How many carbohydrates are in the food I eat?  
How many calories are in the food I eat?

This leads to considerations, but the important thing is the type of food being eaten.

For example, if you eat ice cream that is high in carbohydrates and calories, it will naturally lead to weight gain.

However, a diet that obtains carbohydrates from sweet potatoes and calories from meat does not lead to weight gain.

Ice cream is a processed, refined food.

It releases a large amount of insulin when consumed.

Excessively secreted insulin increases body fat.

It creates false hunger and makes us obese.

Unrefined foods like sweet potatoes and meat do not cause a large release of insulin.

In reality, this is why "not all carbohydrates are the same."

"There are good carbohydrates and bad carbohydrates."

"It's not the calories you consume that matter, but the quality of the food." This kind of talk is becoming more common.

How many carbohydrates are in the diet? How many calories are there? That's not what's important.

Is the food you eat refined or unrefined? This is important.

If you consume unrefined foods, it's okay to increase carbohydrates and calories.

I will summarize.

People who exercise for the purpose of dieting mainly follow a diet that restricts carbohydrates and calories.

When there is a lack of carbohydrates or calories, a reaction that dislikes exercise will occur.

For those who really dislike exercising,

Please check if the carbohydrates or calories in my diet are not too low.

The food you eat at this time should obviously be unrefined food.

Just because there is no shortage of carbohydrates or calories,

It's not that suddenly exercise becomes very enjoyable and you just want to do it.

To reach that level, you need to consistently exercise to increase your muscle mass so that moving your body is not a burden.

The positive effects of exercise should accumulate in the body, leading the brain to send signals to engage in physical activity.

It's not a level that someone who has never exercised can reach just by changing their diet.

What we can expect by changing our diet is

A person who has no strength in their body and can't even start exercising, or someone who really dislikes exercising.

Should I try exercising? I feel like I could do it if I really wanted to, but that's as far as my thoughts go.

You need to consistently exercise in this state to reach a level where you enjoy and like working out.
