Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video about beauty weight.

The playlist link for the previous videos is available at the top right.

If you want to watch the video in front, you can click to view it.

Since the content of the video flows continuously, it would be better to watch it if possible.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about how to achieve a beauty weight without starving or using low-calorie diets.

In the second part of the video, when the woman exercised,

We talked about how the body actually becomes thicker and bulkier.

In this video, we will talk about actual weight.

If you have watched parts 1 and 2 of the beauty weight video,

There are two methods for achieving a slim body weight: underweight and overweight.

Being underweight is difficult to achieve and hard to maintain, but...

Being overweight is relatively not difficult and easy to maintain.

You probably understand that being at a beauty weight through being overweight is better.

However, there are still cases where people have a reluctance to accept that their actual weight is high.

This aversion arises from two causes.

The first is the prejudice against women's weight, and the second is the gaze of others.

Women who are very concerned about the numbers on the scale often aim for a weight in the 40 kg range.

Why specifically 40kg?

What is the ideal weight for a slim and attractive body?

In the case of women, in order to set a target weight for dieting,

In the case of men, they may have such questions out of simple curiosity.

Most people, regardless of gender, obtain this answer through broadcasts.

The female celebrities who appear on broadcasts often wear clothes that reveal their figures.

You can easily check the body shape.

Weight can be checked either through broadcasts or in profiles.

When seen on television, female celebrities with good figures mostly weigh in the 40 kg range.

A weight of around 40kg is considered to have a nicely slim figure.

So, in the case of women, they sometimes set a target weight of around 40 kg.

In the case of men, they might think, "If someone has that body shape at 40 kg, would they be considered chubby if they weigh over 50 kg?"

These thoughts come together to say that if a woman weighs over 50kg, it's considered shameful.

The specifications of the woman with the best figure are said to be 168 cm tall and weighing 45 kg.

However, a weight in the 40kg range does not necessarily mean a beautifully slim body.

In most cases, being extremely thin results in an unappealing appearance.

Women who have experienced or know about this

A weight of 40kg is not considered pretty. People say it's too seriously underweight.

There are many people who do not believe.

Because a female celebrity weighing around 40 kg does not have a body that is extremely thin and unattractive.

It's a body that looks just right, slim and toned.

So, ah~ it's hard to achieve a body shape that looks good and slim at around 40kg.

It seems that, based on the general public's standards, being seriously underweight is considered a problem. This is how I feel.

As a result, the preconceived notion that a body weighing around 40kg is desirable becomes increasingly stronger.

However, there is a very big mistake here.

A person's face is not flat, but the result captured by a camera appears flat.

This difference causes a distortion that makes the subject appear large and widely spread.

Because there is a difference between three-dimensional and two-dimensional, they are not completely the same.

The result captured with a 35mm lens is similar to what the human eye sees.

What happens if you shoot the same person with a lens larger than a 35mm lens?

As the lens gets larger, it will appear bigger and wider.

Simply put, it makes you look fat.

The lenses used in cameras for broadcasting are mostly 230mm or longer.

Compared to a 35mm lens, which is relatively close to a real face, the difference is quite significant.

The 35mm lens appears very thin, but the 230mm and 350mm lenses look just right.

So, in reality, even if the body looks good,

When shooting with a broadcast camera, it appears distorted and makes things look fat.

Even if a celebrity has a slim body in real life, they shouldn't appear overweight on television.

So, I end up losing weight until I become seriously underweight.

In reality, I have a very thin body.

Due to the distortion of the camera, it creates a body shape that looks just right.

So when you actually meet your favorite celebrity

Many people are often surprised to see that they are much thinner than they appeared on television.

So, the body shape that I thought looked just right is not a body weight in the 40 kg range.

A seriously underweight body of around 40kg appears distorted and stretched due to the lens distortion.

So if you aim for a weight of 40kg, it's not about having a slim and pretty body like on TV.

You will end up becoming too seriously thin.

So the saying that a woman's weight is considered shameful if it exceeds 50kg means that...

It's nonsense from someone who has never actually seen a woman weighing around 40kg or 50kg, so you can ignore it.

If the body shape of celebrities seen on television is your goal,

You should aim for a weight that is higher than the celebrity's actual weight.

Sounds plausible, right?
