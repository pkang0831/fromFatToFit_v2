Is there a way to eliminate the reward psychology associated with dieting?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I received a question about the psychology of compensation, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the content of the story.

Hello, I'm a subscriber of pkang.

I got to know pkang through a friend's recommendation, and I watched a lot of videos over the past few days.

I have been obese since I was young, so I have tried various diets, but

Most have failed, and while some have succeeded, ultimately, they experienced a yo-yo effect.

I gave up on my diet and lived my life.

However, after watching your video, I feel like I can succeed in my diet this time.

I am trying to diet again after a few years.

However, I'm worried about the compensation mentality.

I really worked hard on my diet, but...

The reason for failure or experiencing a yo-yo effect is that I overate due to a reward mentality.

Is there a way to eliminate or weaken the sense of compensation?

This is the story with such content, so let's talk about it in detail.

There is a reward experiment aimed at preschoolers.

I love drawing, so I encourage children who draw on their own.

When I started drawing, they began giving me star stickers.

Here, star stickers were items that children could feel rewarded by and liked.

Then, at some point, they stopped giving out star stickers.

Because they don't give star stickers.

The proportion of children who draw pictures has decreased.

Before receiving star stickers, the children who loved to draw would draw on their own.

If you don't give them star stickers, they have changed so that they won't draw pictures.

I used to enjoy drawing.

Does that mean that giving star stickers has changed the way they feel about drawing, so they no longer like it?

How can that be?

Because what you want to do and what you have to do are different.

There is a saying that when a hobby becomes work, it is no longer enjoyable.

A hobby is something I do because I want to.

Because it is something I want to do, the act of doing it itself is rewarding and enjoyable.

Even if it's the same work, when it becomes something you have to do for the sake of earning money, you start to dislike it.

If you give star stickers to the children who drew pictures,

Star stickers are recognized as rewards.

Drawing is perceived as something that needs to be done in order to receive star stickers.

Because of this, drawing has become an unenjoyable task.

It's not enjoyable, so you end up not drawing by yourself.

Now, let's read the story again.

The person shared that they have failed at dieting or experienced a yo-yo effect due to binge eating as a result of compensation psychology.

So, it means that binge eating is perceived as a form of compensation.

The most representative cause of this is a cheat day.

Many people go on diets in difficult and painful ways.

I think of dieting as something that is originally difficult and painful.

This is because people believe that dieting in a difficult and painful way will yield better results.

So, while enduring hunger, I eat less or sometimes skip meals.

While eating food that does not use seasonings that create sweet and salty flavors like sugar and salt,

Diet food is often thought to be tasteless.

Certain nutrients, such as fats or carbohydrates, are sometimes extremely restricted.

This type of diet is difficult and painful, so it's not easy to continue.

There are limits to what can be endured by willpower alone.

So when you diet this way, most people end up having cheat days.

One day a week, I eat whatever I want.

The goal is to reduce the stress caused by dieting and to gain the motivation to continue with the diet.

So the goal is to continue dieting, and to achieve that, having a cheat day is necessary.

When you actually have a cheating day,

Cheat days are recognized as a reward.

Dieting is perceived as something that needs to be done in order to earn the reward of a cheat day.

The goal was clearly to lose weight, and to achieve that, I had a cheat day.

The purpose of dieting gets reversed when you have a cheat day.

Why does that happen?

Dieting is difficult and painful, but cheat days are not.

Let's say there are two drinks.

The drink on the left is a bitter-tasting beverage, and

When it was said that the drink on the right is a sweet-tasting beverage.

If one is a reward and the other is a task that needs to be done,

Which drinks are rewards and which drinks are tasks that need to be done?

I feel that sweet drinks are a reward, while bitter drinks represent the tasks that need to be done.

It makes sense to endure a bitter drink in order to enjoy a sweet beverage, but...

To drink a bitter beverage, it would be strange to say that one is drinking a sweet beverage.

The reason this happens is

Because we unconsciously recognize better things as rewards.

The difficult and painful diet and the non-restrictive cheating day.

When looking at these two aspects, a cheat day is recognized as a reward.

When a cheat day is perceived as a reward, dieting is recognized as something that must be done.

I love drawing, so even the kids who used to draw by themselves...

You said that because drawing became something you had to do, you started to dislike it.

When dieting is perceived as something that must be done, it becomes even less appealing.

The already difficult and painful diet is making me want to give up even more.

In such a situation, if you force yourself to continue dieting, the desire for rewards will become stronger.

So I want to strengthen the reward of cheat days.

On cheat days, you might indulge in binge eating by increasing the amount of food you consume.

It means having cheat days more often.

This is why people fail at dieting or experience a yo-yo effect.

To solve this problem, we need to change the way we approach dieting itself.

The human body is regulated through hormones.

The food we eat affects hormone metabolism.

The reason why people want to eat so much food that they become obese in the first place is...

It's because my appetite has increased abnormally.

This happened because I ate foods that affect hormones and increase appetite.

In a situation where appetite has abnormally increased,

It is difficult to diet because I need to eat a lot to feel satisfied, to the point of becoming obese.

So, in order to diet, you first need to normalize your appetite.

By changing the types of food you eat, you can normalize your appetite.

You can feel full and satisfied without eating so much that you become obese.

I want to eat more food, but I'm just holding back and eating a little.

I ate enough to feel full and satisfied, but that amount is actually less than what I usually eat.

In this way, it becomes possible to diet while eating plenty.

In fact, when looking at success stories of dieting,

In the past, I needed to eat a lot to feel satisfied, but now I feel satisfied with just a little.

Such stories often come up.

The reason this happens is that the appetite has returned to normal.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First, when a hobby becomes a job, it is no longer enjoyable.

Even if it's something I enjoy, if it becomes a task I have to do for other rewards, then...

You start to not want to do that work.

Second. If you have a cheating day while dieting,

Cheat days are a reward. Dieting is perceived as something that must be done.

Because of this, dieting has become more difficult.

The compensation mentality becomes stronger, making it easy to binge eat.

Third. The reason I feel the need for a cheat day while dieting is

It's because they are dieting in a difficult and painful way.

You don't have to suffer and struggle for a diet to work.

Just because it is difficult and painful doesn't mean that the effects of dieting will be greater.

It is advisable to change your dieting method.

I can organize it like this.

In success stories about dieting, there are often mentions of being satisfied even without eating a lot.

The reason for that is because your appetite has returned to normal, right?

But isn't it because your stomach has shrunk from eating less while dieting?

No, it is not.

The human stomach is an elastic organ that can expand and contract in size.

Even if your stomach is full, if you have the appetite to eat more food,

The stomach expands, creating empty space.

I talked about this in detail in another video I made earlier.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

So, to go on a diet, you should first normalize your appetite, right?

What should I do to normalize my appetite?

You need to change the types of food you eat.

I previously explained the principles of dieting and talked about this part in detail.

I've heard that starving or eating very little is not good for dieting, so I understand that.

Isn't it inevitable that a diet meal plan is not tasty?

The perception that diet food is tasteless arises because it restricts sugar and salt.

You don't have to do it that way if you don't want to.

I made a video about this before as well.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

The reason why there is a perception that limiting sugar and salt is good for dieting is

If you're curious about why it's not necessary to do that, you can click here to find out.

Our bodies have a mechanism called homeostasis that helps maintain a stable weight.

They say that even if you succeed in dieting, the yo-yo effect keeps happening.

How can we break homeostasis?

Homeostasis is not something to be broken, but something to be utilized.

I previously made a video about methods that utilize homeostasis.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right corner.
