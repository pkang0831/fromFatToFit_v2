Reasons Why It's Okay to Eat More Carbohydrates - Appetite Part 6

All videos have subtitles.

If you can't see the subtitles, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the sixth video about appetite.

In the last video, we discussed that the reason we become obese is because we eat a lot of food.

The reason for eating a lot of food is said to be due to issues with appetite.

The reason for problems with appetite is said to be the types of food consumed and the imbalance of nutrients.

At the end of this story, several questions arose.

Even if you eat plenty of vegetables and fruits, why does a deficiency in carbohydrates occur?

I mentioned that eating a lot of fats and carbohydrates together is the most fattening combination.

If you are in a situation where you are eating a lot of meat and want to eat carbohydrates, what should you do?

The desire to eat carbohydrates is very strong.

If you eat it, you might lose your reason and end up eating a huge amount.

What should I do in this situation?

In this video, I will try to answer this question.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it is recommended to watch the videos in order starting from the earlier one.

For those who haven't seen the previous video, the link is displayed in the top right corner.

You can click and watch the videos in order starting from the one at the front.

First question: Why is it that even when eating plenty of vegetables and fruits, there is still a lack of carbohydrates?

To understand this question, you need to know what I talked about in the last video.

Right now, our stocks are grains like rice or wheat.

So, I eat a lot of carbohydrates.

This is a situation that has occurred since the beginning of agriculture.

Before agriculture began, people ate meat obtained from hunting and vegetables and fruits gathered from foraging.

Vegetables and fruits have a low carbohydrate content, and due to the nature of foraging, it was not possible to eat large quantities.

Since it is not cultivated through agriculture, we need to find what has been naturally created in the wild.

Finding a large quantity of vegetables and fruits is itself a difficult task.

Even if diarrhea is discovered, there are no means of transportation like cars.

I couldn't bring a large amount.

For this reason, humanity originally did not consume a lot of carbohydrates.

However, with the advent of agriculture and the cultivation of grains, people began to consume carbohydrates in large quantities for the first time.

Many people are experiencing obesity as a side effect because they are unable to adapt to a high carbohydrate diet.

You should reduce your carbohydrate intake.

This is what I talked about in the previous video.

However, if this story is true,

If you eat plenty of vegetables and fruits, you should not be lacking in carbohydrates.

As mentioned earlier, it's difficult to eat a lot of vegetables and fruits through foraging.

It's difficult to discover and also difficult to bring it back.

But we are different now.

Large quantities of vegetables and fruits are being cultivated through agriculture, and because there is a means of transportation called cars.

If I want, I can eat a large amount of vegetables and fruits every day.

So even if you only eat vegetables and fruits,

We can consume a much larger amount of carbohydrates compared to the past.

So from this perspective, the intake of carbohydrates has already increased.

Therefore, there is no reason to be lacking.

But why do symptoms of carbohydrate deficiency occur even when eating a lot of vegetables and fruits?

Should you intentionally eat high carbohydrate density foods like potatoes, sweet potatoes, and brown rice?

This is because the consumption of carbohydrates has increased.

The carbohydrates we consume are primarily used as energy in the brain and muscles.

However, both of these require much more energy compared to the past.

Modern humans have more developed brains than ancient humans.

I think I will use my brain more.

Is it the same for muscles?

Compared to modern people with low activity levels

Didn't ancient humans who lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle have more muscle mass?

The types of developed muscles are different.

Muscles are made up of two types of muscle fibers: slow-twitch fibers and fast-twitch fibers.

While the strength that can be exerted momentarily is weak, it has the characteristic of good endurance.

Fast-twitch muscles are characterized by their ability to generate strong force momentarily, but they have weak endurance.

So, the more developed the fast-twitch muscles are, the stronger the force can be exerted instantaneously.

The more developed the endurance is, the better the stamina is.

In the past, humanity engaged in a lot of hunting and gathering activities.

As a result of that activity, my skills have developed significantly.

You must keep moving until you find something to hunt or gather.

If you succeed in hunting and gathering, you need to transport the results over a long distance.

In this process, endurance, which allows for consistent strength rather than a momentary burst of power, is important.

Therefore, it develops mainly with a focus on slow-twitch fibers.

On the other hand, modern society aims for the development of fast-twitch muscles.

To develop endurance, one needs to engage in prolonged exercise.

Busy modern individuals cannot spend much time on exercise, and

Due to the nature of the muscle, even with development, muscle mass does not increase easily.

So even though I exercise hard, there isn't much change in my body.

However, the fast-twitch muscle fibers are the exact opposite of this.

Because it is a muscle that generates strong power instead of having endurance.

Even if the workout time is short, if you apply a strong load, it will lead to development.

Due to the characteristic of generating strong force momentarily, if fast-twitch muscles develop, muscle mass will also increase.

As muscle mass increases, the body will also change.

In modern society, there is often a lack of time to exercise, and the main purpose of exercising is mostly for beauty.

What meets these two conditions is called a "fast muscle."

So, in contrast to past humans who primarily developed slow-twitch muscles, we are focusing on developing fast-twitch muscles.

This leads to a need for more carbohydrates.

Due to the characteristics of fast-twitch muscles, which require a strong burst of power in an instant, they consume a lot of carbohydrates.

Because of this, the body can store more carbohydrates in the subcutaneous fat than in the visceral fat.

Moreover, in the past, it was difficult to obtain carbohydrates, and protein and fat were also hard to come by.

So, the protein intake was not high, and the calorie intake was also lower than it is now.

Even if you have a high level of activity and exercise, if you lack protein, your muscle mass will not increase.

Even if muscle mass increases, if calories are not consistently supplied, muscle loss can occur.

So, modern humans have more muscle mass than humans in the past.

That muscle develops primarily as fast-twitch fibers, which use and store more carbohydrates.

The amount of carbohydrates stored and used in muscles is much greater than that of past humans.

The brain of modern humans is more developed and used more than that of past humanity.

So, in the case of people who use their brains a lot or have high levels of activity and exercise,

It can be difficult to meet carbohydrate needs with just vegetables and fruits, which may lead to symptoms of carbohydrate deficiency.

Feeling weak in the body makes it difficult to exercise or engage in activities.

Even if I force myself, I get tired easily.

I often find it difficult to think and end up zoning out.

To make up for the lack of carbohydrates, the desire for food can become stronger.

I only eat carbohydrates from vegetables and fruits.

Since I'm only eating vegetables and fruits, I feel like I'm lacking carbohydrates. Even when I'm full, I still want to eat something, and I have cravings for binge eating.

However, I am currently eating quite a lot of meat.

In the last video, you mentioned that eating a lot of carbohydrates and fats together is the most fattening.

I'm worried that if I eat carbohydrates while consuming a lot of meat, I might gain weight.

What should I do?

In order for that to happen, the amount of meat consumed should not change even if carbohydrates are eaten.

However, that's not actually the case.

Let's think about the stage before the current state of eating a lot of meat.

Since I started my diet, I probably haven't eaten much meat.

However, there was a phenomenon where my appetite increased due to a lack of carbohydrates in my diet.

Because of the belief that eating carbohydrates leads to weight gain, I chose to eat more meat.

As a result, we have ended up in a state where we eat a lot of meat now.

In reality, among those who follow a ketogenic diet that restricts carbohydrate intake,

There are quite a few people who are worried about eating too much meat.

However, if you stop the ketogenic diet and add sweet potatoes to your meals,

Most of the time, I can't even eat half of the meat I used to eat and end up leaving some behind.

The reason I initially ate a lot of meat was due to a lack of carbohydrates, which led to increased appetite.

Eating carbohydrates makes my appetite disappear and prevents me from eating a lot of meat.

If you are following a diet low in carbohydrates,

Try adding high-carbohydrate foods like sweet potatoes, potatoes, and brown rice to your diet.

You need to check how your meal portion changes after eating carbohydrates.

You will probably end up eating less meat instead of carbohydrates.

Out of the three questions that were presented at the beginning of the video, two have been answered.

The last question is about the amount of food consumed.

The desire to eat is so strong, but what should I do if I eat too much?

In the next video, I will discuss meal portions along with the answer to this question.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the appetite episode 7, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.
