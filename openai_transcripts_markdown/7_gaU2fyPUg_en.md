Does fasting to lose weight not lower your basal metabolic rate? Basal Metabolic Rate Part 1

Hello, this is pkang.

If you follow a starvation diet or a low-calorie diet, your basal metabolic rate decreases, making it easier to gain weight.

If you are someone interested in dieting, this is a story you have probably heard often.

I have mentioned this several times in other videos as well.

There are research findings that indicate that even when fasting, the basal metabolic rate does not decrease.

There is a comment asking what you think about this.

In this video, I would like to talk about fasting diets and basal metabolic rate.

If you skip meals and go hungry, your basal metabolic rate decreases, making it easier to gain weight.

In this sentence, there is no discussion about how long one needs to starve for their basal metabolic rate to decrease.

Many people misunderstand that even skipping one meal can lower their basal metabolic rate.

Skipping a meal does not lower your basal metabolic rate.

The problem is that there are quite a few people who have such misunderstandings.

From their perspective, methods like intermittent fasting appear to be very unfavorable.

Intermittent fasting is a dietary method that involves intentionally having periods of fasting during which no food is consumed.

There is a fasting period where you don't eat food, so it is thought that the basal metabolic rate decreases.

However, intermittent fasting and starvation diets are completely different.

The purpose of intermittent fasting, to begin with, is not to lose weight by starving yourself.

The original purpose of intermittent fasting is to prevent overeating, which is consuming more food than necessary.

Modern humanity is overeating, consuming more food than necessary, and as a result, is becoming increasingly obese.

Because the digestive system is being overworked and health is deteriorating.

Having fasting periods without eating helps to prevent overeating.

The goal is to give the digestive system a rest and recover health.

This means that dieting will happen naturally that way.

So the goal is not to lose weight by eating less or not eating at all.

The goal of this eating method is to reduce the amount of food that you have been eating excessively to a moderate portion.

So, just as the fasting period during which you don't eat is important, the meal times are also very important.

However, recently, there have been quite a few cases where people focus too much on the fasting period and neglect their meal times.

For example, even though I reduced my food intake by fasting,

Eating low-calorie foods during meal times.

Alternatively, you can continue to extend the fasting period, gradually eating less and less.

In this case, it is called intermittent fasting, but...

It becomes no different from a low-calorie diet or starvation diet.

So if you want to practice intermittent fasting, you need to understand the essence of it accurately.

I covered intermittent fasting in detail in a previous series of videos.

For those who want more details, you can click the link in the upper right corner to view it.

Returning to the original story.

Intermittent fasting and starving to lose weight are completely different, but there has been a misunderstanding that they are the same.

Because of this misunderstanding, I have continuously faced criticism that intermittent fasting lowers the basal metabolic rate.

In intermittent fasting, to counter this attack,

Research results have shown that even with intermittent fasting, the basal metabolic rate does not decrease.

The people who initially attacked intermittent fasting are...

I had the misconception that intermittent fasting and starving to lose weight are the same.

So, reporting on the research results of intermittent fasting.

Even if you lose weight by starving yourself, your basal metabolic rate does not decrease. This leads to a new misunderstanding that losing weight by starving is acceptable.

However, intermittent fasting and starvation diets are completely different.

Intermittent fasting does not lower your basal metabolic rate.

If you lose weight by starving yourself, your basal metabolic rate will decrease.

Modern humanity finds it easy to obtain food, but past humanity had a hard time finding food.

When you are unable to find food and go hungry, your basal metabolic rate decreases.

Humanity, which struggled to obtain food in the past, would not have survived and would have all died.

Humanity has evolved to resist hunger.

It is logically incorrect to say that the basal metabolic rate decreases when one is starving.

There is a story like this; what do you think about it?

It's somewhat true.

In fact, humanity has evolved to resist hunger.

One of the processes involves a reaction that tries to prevent the basal metabolic rate from decreasing as much as possible.

This is something I briefly mentioned in the video [Reasons for Not Wanting to Exercise While Dieting].

The energy a person consumes in a day consists of three components: basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate.

Basal metabolic rate refers to the energy used by major organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

The term "active metabolic rate" refers to the energy used in activities, not exercise.

Exercise metabolic rate refers to the energy used during physical activity.

If you starve yourself or follow a low-calorie diet, you will end up in a situation where you lack energy.

First, there is a reaction aimed at reducing energy consumption.

If you lower your basal metabolic rate, the functions of your major organs will decline.

This can negatively impact health and life, making survival unfavorable.

In order to protect the basal metabolic rate, a reaction occurs that lowers other metabolic rates first.

So, the metabolic rate from exercise and activity tends to decrease before the basal metabolic rate.

If you starve yourself or follow a low-calorie diet,

The reason I don't want to move and don't want to exercise is because I feel weak.

So, in a situation where there is a lack of energy,

There is a reaction that lowers other metabolic rates first to protect the basal metabolic rate.

Thanks to this reaction, humanity in the past was able to survive hunger.

However, this is based on a short period of time.

When the smartphone battery is low

If you close the app you were using and lower the screen brightness, you can use your smartphone a little longer.

This is because the power consumption has been reduced.

Just because the power consumption has been reduced doesn't mean that the smartphone will never turn off.

If you don't charge the battery, it will eventually reach 0, and the smartphone will turn off.

Similarly, in a situation where the calories obtained from food are insufficient,

Even if you lower your activity metabolism and exercise metabolism to protect your basal metabolic rate,

If the situation of insufficient calories continues, you will eventually have to lower your basal metabolic rate.

In a situation where food is not available, the body stores fat as emergency food.

If you can't obtain food, your body will use body fat for energy, not break down muscle for energy.

Therefore, it doesn't make sense that muscle loss occurs and basal metabolic rate decreases when following a starvation diet.

I've heard such claims. What do you think about this?

In the next video, we will discuss this question.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to display the next video on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the basal metabolic rate video, please wait a few days as we are still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
