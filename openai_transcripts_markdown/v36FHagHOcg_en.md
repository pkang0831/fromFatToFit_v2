Reasons for binge eating after sticking to a diet - Appetite Part 4

All videos have subtitles.

If you can't see the subtitles, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

In the last video, we talked about refined foods that increase appetite.

Overeating due to increased appetite from processed foods is the cause of obesity.

Reducing refined foods and eating unrefined foods is the foundation of dieting.

Even when following a diet with unrefined foods, there are times when my appetite increases and I end up binge eating.

Many comments have been posted asking for help after experiencing this phenomenon.

In this video, I would like to talk about the reasons why people suddenly binge eat after following a diet well.

To conclude, the reason for that phenomenon is due to a deficiency in the diet.

There are two types of human appetite.

The first is the judgment of the need for food, which involves hunger and fullness.

The second is the type of food needed, which is the food you want to eat.

So, when there is a lack of carbohydrates, you crave foods that are high in carbohydrates.

When there is a lack of protein, you crave foods that are high in protein.

When you're lacking fat, you crave foods that are high in fat.

If you actually restrict certain nutrients, you can clearly feel this phenomenon.

A typical example is the ketogenic diet.

The ketogenic diet is one type of low-carb, high-fat diet.

It is a diet aimed at putting our bodies into a state of ketosis, which is characterized by a lack of carbohydrates.

So, carbohydrate intake is greatly restricted, while there are no limits on the intake of protein and fat.

When a meat lover first encounters this diet, they might think that the diet will be very easy.

If you only restrict carbohydrates, you can eat as much meat as you want.

However, when you actually try to stick to a diet, it's not easy to maintain it.

At first, the meat is delicious and very enjoyable, but as time goes by, I gradually lose my appetite for it.

Sometimes I find myself wanting to eat fruits that I usually don't eat, or I have a stronger desire to eat rice rather than meat.

Since I can eat meat without restrictions, there is no shortage of food and the calories are sufficient.

The lack of carbohydrates creates a desire for them.

So if there is something lacking in the diet you are currently following,

To fill what is lacking, a phenomenon occurs where appetite increases.

If there was something lacking in the diet, shouldn't there have been a problem already?

It's been a few months since I started my diet, and there haven't been any issues until now. Why has my appetite suddenly increased?

It's because my body has changed and my lifestyle has changed.

The reason for deciding to diet is that there is a lot of body fat.

Excess body fat is not only undesirable for aesthetic reasons, but it is also detrimental to survival.

A body with a lot of body fat is less active.

Excess body fat causes inflammation, which is not good for overall health.

Therefore, a body with high body fat and obesity has a response to reduce body fat for survival.

However, due to the increased appetite from processed foods, I end up eating too often and too much.

I want to reduce body fat, but I haven't had the chance to do so.

If I don't eat processed foods and my appetite returns to normal,

A body with a high amount of body fat prioritizes reducing body fat.

During the process of reducing body fat, it supplies energy to our body.

Because of this energy, a phenomenon occurs where one feels satisfied even without eating a lot of food.

If you look at the comments on my videos, there are quite a few questions about meal portions.

As I was advised, I reduced my intake of refined foods and started eating unrefined foods.

My appetite has decreased, so my food intake has reduced.

Even eating about 1000 calories a day is enough to feel full, and I don't want to eat food.

Is it okay to eat it like this?

Should I force myself to eat more food? This is the question I'm asking.

In the first place, the energy a person consumes in a day is over 1000 calories just from their basal metabolic rate.

Why is it that I don't feel hungry even when I only eat 1000 calories?

It is due to the energy supplied from body fat.

However, if this situation continues, body fat will gradually decrease.

When body fat decreases, the body's natural response to reduce body fat will weaken.

In the past, I had so much body fat that it threatened my survival, but now my body fat has decreased significantly.

In the beginning of starting a diet because of this, weight decreases rapidly, but...

The more body fat decreases, the harder it becomes to lose weight.

When the body's response to reducing body fat weakens, the energy supplied from body fat decreases.

If the energy supplied from body fat decreases, you will need to obtain that amount from food.

So, during the time when there was a lot of body fat, it was okay to have a diet low in fat.

As time goes by, if body fat decreases, it becomes a problem that the diet lacks fat.

And this applies equally to carbohydrates and proteins as well.

It takes little energy to move a light object, but...

To move a heavy object, a lot of energy is needed.

A person who is overweight due to obesity requires a lot of energy to move.

So there is a reaction to not wanting to move much.

Conversely, when weight decreases due to dieting, there is an increase in activity levels.

For example, the body of a person who weighs 100 kg is

In order to support and move a body weighing 100kg, the muscles inevitably have to develop accordingly.

If the muscles do not develop like this, that person won't be able to get up and walk.

In such a situation, if weight decreases by 10 kg,

With muscles capable of supporting 100kg, if you only need to support 90kg, it creates a relative ease.

So, the level of activity increases.

In this case, after losing weight through diet alone and feeling lighter, some people may start exercising.

If you had been exercising consistently, you might have become accustomed to it and increased the intensity of your workouts.

When there is a change in activity level and exercise, it is natural that there will also be a change in the food needed.

If you increase your activity level and exercise, you will consume a lot of carbohydrates.

To supplement that carbohydrate, the amount of necessary carbohydrates will increase.

When muscles increase due to the effects of activity and exercise,

The amount of protein needed increases for muscle synthesis.

In such a situation, maintaining the same diet will naturally lead to deficiencies.

The purpose of dieting, whether to reduce body fat or increase muscle mass, is to change my current body.

To do that, you need to change your diet and lifestyle patterns.

When the body changes and lifestyle patterns change, it is natural for the necessary nutrients to also change.

To put it simply, the diet that worked for me when I started my diet was

After a few months, my body and lifestyle patterns have changed, and they can't just fit as they were.

In such a situation, it is only natural that problems will arise if you force yourself to stick to the same diet.

Rather than sticking to the same diet, it is better to adjust your diet according to the changes in your body.

I want to eat cake. Does that mean my body needs cake?

No, that's not the case.

In the next video, I will talk about how to change your diet according to your appetite.
