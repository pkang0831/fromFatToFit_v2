Hello, this is pkang.

This is the fourth video about cellulite, created in response to questions about cellulite that were posted in the comments.

The link to the previous video is displayed at the top right, so if you want to watch the previous video, you can click on it.

Since there is a lot of content that continues from the previous video, I recommend watching it if possible.

In the first video, there is a person who is obese.

In the second video, a person with a normal weight.

In the third video, among the thin people,

We looked into the reasons why cellulite develops in people who stand for long periods or walk a lot.

In this video, we will discuss individuals who are thin and do not stand for long periods or walk much.

I will talk about the reasons why cellulite forms.

In the case of the videos that were shown earlier, it's not unusual for cellulite to appear.

Because I can see some reasons why cellulite might develop.

The person with obesity mentioned in Part 1 has a lot of subcutaneous fat.

So one might vaguely think that this is how cellulite forms.

In the case of dry obesity, even though the weight is normal, there is a lot of subcutaneous fat.

You might think, "This is caused by the fact that there is a lot of subcutaneous fat in that area," because there is a lot of fat there.

In the case of the thin person mentioned in Part 3, there is no subcutaneous fat, but

The leg muscles are overworked, and this causes cellulite to form.

During the process of overworking the legs, there may be symptoms such as pain or swelling in the legs.

I don't know the detailed principles, but...

You can vaguely guess that this is what causes cellulite.

However, the person in this video is thin, so they don't have much body fat.

My legs don't hurt or swell.

So even if cellulite forms, I have no idea why it happens.

So they are feeling quite frustrated.

The cause is a fluid circulation disorder.

What is a fluid circulation disorder?

The outermost layer of skin that we commonly refer to as skin is called the epidermis.

Beneath the epidermis, there is the dermis layer.

There is subcutaneous fat beneath the dermis, and below that, there are muscles.

In the dermis, there are various structures such as blood vessels, sebaceous glands, lymphatic vessels, and sweat glands, which serve as pathways for the circulation of different bodily fluids.

However, among the bodily fluids, blood is pumped by the heart, and it circulates with that force.

Other bodily fluids are not pumped by the heart, right?

So, circulation is done through the power of muscles.

In the case of thin people, they have less muscle mass.

In that case, the strength of fluid circulation will also be weaker due to the lower muscle mass.

If a person like this sits in a chair for a long time, their thighs and buttocks get pressed against the chair.

At this time, the dermis layer of the thighs and buttocks is subjected to pressure, which disrupts fluid circulation.

If you have a lot of muscle mass and strong fluid circulation, there shouldn't be any issues with circulation even under pressure.

If you have low muscle mass and are weak, it can lead to problems with fluid circulation.

If fluid circulation is not functioning properly, the dermis layer becomes weakened.

When the dermis weakens, subcutaneous fat can penetrate into the dermis.

When infiltrated subcutaneous fat entangles with body fluids and forms lumps, this becomes cellulite.

Even if you don't lead a lifestyle of sitting for long periods, clothes that put pressure on the body.

For example, people who wear very tight jeans also develop cellulite for the same reason, as the clothing puts pressure on the body.

So, should I only wear loose clothing that doesn't constrict my body and avoid sitting in a chair for long periods?

The cause is that the dermis layer is being pressed due to external pressure.

The more fundamental reason is that the force driving fluid circulation itself is weak.

So when you build muscle through exercise, the strength of the muscles increases.

The force of fluid circulation will also become stronger.

In that case, even if there is external pressure, fluid circulation becomes possible.

So if it's difficult to avoid wearing tight clothing or sitting for long periods of time,

Building muscle through exercise can also resolve cellulite caused by fluid circulation disorders.

So far, we have been discussing the various causes of cellulite and ways to address it.

If none of the content covered in the video applies to you so far,

It could be a problem related to the last food consumed.

In the next video, we will talk about foods that cause cellulite.

Once the video is completed, I will place a link in the upper right corner.

If the link is not available, it means that the video is still being made, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.
