Does living in the cold make you lose weight? Does it lead to the accumulation of body fat? Which one is correct?

In the subcutaneous fat series I created before,

If you exercise to increase muscle mass and boost your activity level,

Heat is generated in the muscles.

Humans are warm-blooded animals, which means that their body temperature must be maintained at a constant level.

This heat needs to be released from the body.

The subcutaneous fat with insulating properties interferes with this.

It was said that exercising is an effective way to reduce body fat.

After watching that series, I wonder if living in a hot environment reduces body fat.

Many people ask whether living in a cold environment increases body fat.

In the video right before this one, I talked about living in a hot environment.

In this video, I would like to talk about living in cold conditions.

To put it simply, let's start with the conclusion.

In cases of living in a cold environment, subcutaneous fat may increase.

I heard that there are research results indicating that living in a cold environment can reduce body fat.

Yes, that's right. It is true that such research exists.

However, saying that body fat decreases is not the same as saying that subcutaneous fat decreases.

Body fat refers to all the fat present in our body.

This body fat is divided into subcutaneous fat, which is located under the skin, and visceral fat, which is located next to the internal organs.

So, when you combine subcutaneous fat and visceral fat, it's referred to as body fat.

If we take a closer look at the research that suggests living in cold conditions can reduce body fat,

In cold environments, more energy is consumed to maintain body temperature.

It states that body fat decreases because more energy is consumed.

As mentioned in the subcutaneous fat series,

The role of supplying energy to our body is performed by visceral fat.

So, if you live in a cold environment, you consume more energy.

This means that visceral fat decreases because more energy is consumed.

This visceral fat is also a type of body fat, so we can simply say that body fat is decreasing.

However, from the perspective of subcutaneous fat, it actually increases.

Just like we wear clothes to prevent the loss of body heat when it's cold.

Our body also increases fat reserves when it's cold to prevent the loss of body heat.

In the first place, body fat itself protects the body from external shocks.

Because fat serves the role of clothing that prevents the loss of body heat.

Of course, just because it's a bit cold for a moment doesn't mean that body fat will suddenly increase.

It means that continuous exposure to cold environments increases the amount of subcutaneous fat.

In summary, there is research indicating that living in cold conditions can reduce body fat, but...

The body fat mentioned in that study refers to visceral fat, not subcutaneous fat.

In the case of subcutaneous fat, it can actually increase to prevent the loss of body heat.

So, does living in a cold environment actually help reduce visceral fat?

Well... this is correct in the short term, but not in the long term.

In the next video, I will talk about whether visceral fat decreases when living in a cold environment.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not about living in the cold and visceral fat, then...

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
