Hello, this is Geungha. This is the eleventh video about eating disorders.

So far, I have talked about my workplace over the course of 10 videos, but this time...

In the video, we summarize the content of previous videos and discuss solutions for anorexia and binge eating disorder.

I would like to share a helpful story.

First, let's discuss the type of anorexia where individuals eat very little, and then we will draft after they have eaten.

There is a type.

Although the types are different, the issue lies in the thought that one should not eat food, which is the same.

In severe cases, the act of eating itself can be seen as dirty and disgusting.

I do listen to it.

To overcome anorexia, you need to change this mindset.

You should have the mindset that it's okay to eat food and that you need to eat food.

Ah, if you actually look at the process of treating anorexia, there is a set amount to be consumed at a designated time.

Make sure to eat the food.

After eating, I make sure to spend time together so that they don't throw up.

If you leave food uneaten or throw up, you will receive a calorie injection.

However, at this time, the calories from many calorie injections are much more concentrated than those from food.

There is.

The reason I'm throwing up without eating is because of my diet.

If you leave food or throw up, you'll end up consuming more calories, so you should eat the food.

You need to make it so that you're outside. After maintaining a regular eating schedule like this,

After conducting a physical examination, the results of the white test show that I have been consistently eating food, but...

You can tell that body fat is not very noticeable.

Just because you show this doesn't mean that eating food will necessarily reveal body fat.

It was said that it is okay to eat food, and various health indicators were good.

Show the space and create a self-card to express that you also feel the space has improved.

It makes you think that you need to eat food.

The content of the movie from the entrance to the exit of the 30th chapter is helpful in this part.

This is the content.

Please point out where the thinking is wrong regarding not eating food.

It is content that helps you develop the mindset that you need to eat food.

In the case of binge eating disorder and anorexia, there are various reasons, but there is one major cause.

It has been organized.

However, in the case of binge eating disorder, the causes can be divided into three categories.

The first is binge eating caused by ringing in the ears, and the second is eating too little food.

The third type of binge eating that comes as a reaction is due to psychological issues.

If you frequently consume processed refined foods, a large amount of insulin will be secreted.

Insulin secreted into the bloodstream increases appetite and triggers binge eating. Pack 11.

The method is to reduce the intake of processed foods, but it means you have to eat less.

No, we need to change the type of food we eat.

The video on foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight explains what kinds of food you should eat.

I explained it in detail.

The video event is appearing in the top right, so please refer to that video to see if you are eating.

Please change the paper.

In the case of eating less of the second meal and then experiencing a rebound binge, what should be done?

The cause is eating too little, so the solution is to eat more food.

Ah

The thought of not wanting to eat is connected to anorexia, which is an eating disorder.

If you keep in mind that you should eat from the entrance to the exit,

At this time, it's obvious that you shouldn't eat Lee Jung-jae's food.

If you study or refer to foods for bracelets and weight loss, please choose unrefined options.

It works.

I am experiencing a third mental issue related to Mahjong, which is leading to binge eating and feelings of emptiness, similar to other negative experiences.

It is a symptom of binge eating that occurs when trying to forget emotions by eating food.

The solution is to acknowledge and release these negative emotions themselves.

In the 8th episode of the eating disorder series, the content from 0 to 10 minutes discusses the causes of negative emotions and their relationship to the disorder.

I have looked at all the solutions based on the causes, so you can refer to the content of the video.

In cases of light binge eating or something like that, you can watch the videos I just mentioned.

If you correct your thinking, you can definitely resolve it.

However, in severe cases, it can be difficult to resolve these issues solely with knowledge and personal will.

There are also cases.

In such cases, please make sure to visit a hospital and seek help.

I hope this can be of some help to those who are struggling with eating disorders.

It is becoming more and more.

Thank you.
