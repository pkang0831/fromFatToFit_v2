Why do people say ramen makes you gain weight when one serving is 500 kcal? - Ramen Part 2

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

Ramen is not very high in calories and there are no issues with its nutritional components.

Ramen is not a fattening food.

I saw a video on YouTube with this kind of content, and there was a question in the comments asking what I think about it.

So I created a response video.

As the views of that video increased, various comments were posted.

Among them, eating only ramen will never make you gain weight. Ramen is not a fattening food.

There were many comments like this.

You are completely opposite to me in classifying ramen as a fattening food.

So, I would like to talk in more detail about whether ramen is a fattening food.

The link to the previous video is displayed in the top right corner.

If you want to watch the videos in order from the last one, you can click and watch them.

The claim that ramen is not a fattening food is based on three main reasons.

The first is the calorie content of ramen.

The second is exercise.

The third type is a person who doesn't gain weight even after eating ramen.

First, let's talk about the calories in ramen.

Looking at the nutritional information for ramen, one serving contains about 500 kcal.

Assuming three meals a day,

If you eat ramen for all three meals, the total calories you would get is 1500 kcal.

Considering that the daily metabolic rate for adult men and women is between 2000 to 2500 kcal,

1500 kcal per day is not that high. In fact, it's rather insufficient.

Therefore, you can cook and eat 2 or 3 packs of ramen at once.

It's not just about finishing with eating ramen; it's about eating more rice or snacks, which leads to gaining weight.

Ramen itself is not a fattening food.

This concludes the argument that ramen is not a fattening food based on its calorie content.

This claim itself is entirely correct.

It is true that one serving of ramen has 500 kcal.

It is true that the daily metabolic rate for adult men and women is between 2000 to 2500 kcal.

If you eat exactly 3 servings of ramen a day, the maximum calories you can obtain is 1500 kcal.

In the first place, a person cannot absorb all the calories from the food they eat.

In reality, the amount absorbed is likely to be less than 1500 kcal.

Q. So, is it correct to say that ramen is not a fattening food?

What foods can be considered fattening? It depends on the criteria used.

I have mentioned it several times in other videos, but...

Processed foods, foods high in carbohydrates, and salty foods have the effect of increasing appetite.

Ramen is a processed food.

Looking at the nutritional components of ramen, the density of carbohydrates is quite high.

It is also a very salty food with a high sodium content.

So when you eat ramen, it increases your appetite because of the ramen.

Because of this increased appetite, one bowl of ramen is not enough to satisfy me.

You can cook and eat 2 or 3 packs of ramen at once.

After eating ramen, I either eat more rice or have more snacks.

So the reason we gain weight is due to overeating.

The cause of overeating is foods like ramen.

So the cause of obesity is overeating, not ramen.

This is a statement from the perspective that ramen is not a fattening food.

The cause of obesity is overeating. However, the reason for that overeating is ramen.

Therefore, ramen is a fattening food.

This is the story I am telling.

It's not that one side is right and the other side is wrong.

To what extent should we consider the causes of obesity? It varies depending on this criterion.

So eating one bowl of ramen doesn't make you gain weight, but...

Ramen increases appetite, so it's considered a food that makes you gain weight.

Is there a reason why the criteria for fattening foods is based on foods that increase appetite?

To distinguish between foods that cause weight gain, it's because it can't be helped.

I mentioned it in the last video as well.

No food in this world makes you gain weight if you eat just a little bit.

It's because you eat a lot of ramen at once or eat ramen and then eat more food, which causes you to gain weight.

When you eat a little bit of ramen, you don't gain weight.

From this perspective, there can be no such thing as fattening food in this world.

It's because I'm drinking a lot that I'm gaining weight.

Without drinking too much alcohol

Drinking just a little won't make you gain weight.

It's because I eat a lot of fried food that I'm gaining weight.

If you don't eat a lot of fried food and only have a little, you won't gain weight.

Drinking a lot of carbonated beverages is the problem.

Drinking a little soda won't make you gain weight.

That's all true.

Alcohol, fried food, carbonated drinks, snacks, cake.

Eating a small amount of any food does not lead to weight gain.

So, if the standard for fattening food is that even a little bit can make you gain weight, then...

Such food doesn't exist in the world in the first place.

To distinguish between foods that cause weight gain and those that do not,

There needs to be a standard for identifying foods that cause weight gain.

That standard refers to foods that increase appetite.

It is true that foods like ramen increase appetite, and if that is the standard for foods that cause weight gain, then...

If I don't eat foods like ramen, I guess I'll lose weight?

Yes, that's right. It's to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and those that don't.

Distinguish between foods that increase appetite and those that do not.

When you eat according to this distinction, your appetite will return to normal.

When your appetite returns to normal, the desire to eat a lot will disappear.

When the craving for food disappears, you can feel satisfied even without eating a lot.

In that case, there would be no reason to eat a lot of food.

If you don't eat a lot, you will naturally lose weight.

It's not about forcing myself to eat less while feeling hungrier and wanting more food.

Since my appetite has returned to normal, I can eat until I'm full and satisfied, but the amount isn't that much.

That's how dieting works.

If you actually look at the comments on my video,

I thought I was originally someone with a big appetite and a hearty eater.

When I changed the types of food I eat, my cravings disappeared and I started eating less.

There are quite a few experiences like this.

It actually has an effect.

So, the problem is foods that are high in carbohydrates, right?

So, should I not eat carbohydrates?

No, that's not the case.

It's not that carbohydrates themselves are the problem.

The problem is that eating too many carbohydrates is an issue.

It means that you need to reduce the carbohydrates you are consuming too much to an appropriate level.

It doesn't mean to completely avoid carbohydrates.

I will summarize.

It is correct that ramen has a relatively low calorie count, with one serving containing 500 kcal.

However, it is a processed food that is high in sodium and carbohydrates, which can increase appetite.

When appetite increases, one needs to eat a lot of food to feel satisfied.

If you continue this kind of eating habits, you will become obese.

The cause of obesity is overeating, and the reason for this overeating is foods like ramen.

Even though ramen itself is not high in calories, it can be classified as a food that makes you gain weight.

Let's wrap up this video here.

In the next video, we will talk about exercise and ramen.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears in the top right corner.

If the top right is blank, it means I am still in the process of making the video.

Please wait a few more days.
