Why do we gain weight when we can't sleep? - Sleep Diet Part 1

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitle feature.

Recently, a question like this was posted in the comments.

They say that when we sleep, our bodies rest, which lowers our metabolism.

So that means if you don't sleep, you consume more energy.

It seems that consuming more energy would be better for dieting.

Why do people say that not getting enough sleep leads to weight gain?

That's an interesting question.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

During sleep, our body's metabolism decreases.

This is a true story.

Therefore, if the duration of sleep is short and the metabolic rate is low, more energy is consumed.

This is also a valid point.

If you think about it simply,

Because the sleeping time is short, it consumes more energy.

It seems like it would be better for dieting.

In reality, it is not like that.

Humans are animals of adaptation, and depending on the situation, the condition of the body changes.

I talked about the reasons why you might not lose weight even when you do exercises that burn a lot of calories in the video.

By following a low-calorie diet, you will reduce the calorie intake that enters your body.

Our bodies change to adapt to the situation.

The calories consumed by the body decrease.

This means that if you follow a low-calorie diet or a starvation diet, your basal metabolic rate decreases.

This applies directly to exercise as well.

Many people believe that increasing the calories burned through exercise will...

I think that body fat decreases by that amount of calories.

In reality, a response occurs to replenish the calories expended during exercise.

Increased appetite leads to eating more food to replenish the energy expended.

The absorption rate has increased, allowing us to obtain more energy from the same food.

By lowering other metabolic rates such as basal metabolic rate or activity metabolic rate.

You try to secure the energy needed for exercise.

Similarly, if the sleeping time is short and the energy consumed by the body increases,

It's not that body fat decreases in proportion to the increased energy.

An increase in appetite occurs as a response to replenish the energy that has been expended.

An experiment comparing the levels of leptin hormone in cases of actual deep sleep versus those without it was conducted.

In the case of having a good night's sleep, it is 5.3, and in the case of not having a good night's sleep, it is 3.7.

When you do not get enough sleep, there is a phenomenon where the leptin hormone decreases further.

What is the leptin hormone?

It is a hormone that induces a feeling of fullness.

It is a hormone that pairs with ghrelin, which makes you feel hungry.

When the situation arises that food is needed

Leptin decreases and ghrelin increases, leading to feelings of hunger.

On the contrary, if you have eaten enough food,

Ghrelin decreases and leptin increases, which makes you feel full.

The statement that leptin hormone levels were lower in cases of not getting enough sleep means that...

If you don't get enough sleep, it means you feel hunger more intensely.

However, that's to replenish the energy consumed due to not sleeping.

Well, that doesn't mean you'll gain weight from it.

That's what happens when you eat foods that don't make you gain weight.

The problem is that the food I want to eat at this time is unhealthy food that makes you gain weight.

Sleeping is fundamentally an act of resting, but

The subjects of rest here include both the body and the mind.

Having a short amount of sleep means that the time for the mind to rest is also short.

This leads to feelings of irritation and depression.

I find myself unconsciously looking for sweet foods.

Sweet foods increase the secretion of serotonin, which is known as the happiness hormone.

This serotonin helps reduce irritability and feelings of depression.

As mentioned in the video about distinguishing between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight,

Sweet foods high in carbohydrates quickly raise blood sugar levels significantly.

When blood sugar rises rapidly and significantly, a large amount of insulin is secreted.

This is the cause of obesity.

In the end, the problem is that eating sweet foods leads to a lot of insulin being released, right?

So, if I don't get enough sleep, is it okay as long as I don't eat sweet foods?

It is better not to eat sweet foods than to eat them.

Still, it doesn't solve the problem.

Even if you don't eat sweet foods,

If you don't get enough sleep, insulin is released.

Are you saying that insulin is released even when food hasn't been eaten?

Yes, that's right.

In the next video, we will discuss why insulin is released when you don't get proper sleep, even if you don't eat.

I will talk about this.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the sleep diet video,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
