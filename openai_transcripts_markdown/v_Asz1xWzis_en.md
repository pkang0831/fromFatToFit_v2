Does skipping dinner have any effects? Can it help with weight loss?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

If you eat breakfast like an emperor, lunch like a commoner, and dinner like a beggar, you will lose weight.

If you skip dinner for a month, you will lose weight.

There are many stories like this, but is it really effective?

A question like this was posted in the comments.

To put it simply,

Under the same circumstances regarding the amount of food consumed in a day, the types of food, and the calories of the food.

Eating less for dinner compared to breakfast and lunch, or not eating dinner at all, is

It is not that it has a dieting effect compared to not doing it.

There is actually an example of an experiment that was conducted.

41 overweight individuals who have symptoms of diabetes or are in the pre-diabetes stage were divided into two groups.

The first group is instructed to consume 80% of their total calories before 1 PM.

The second group was instructed to consume 50% of their total calories after 5 PM.

So, the first group mostly had their meals for breakfast and lunch.

The second group was instructed to have half of their total meals for dinner.

At this time, the amount of food consumed, the types of food, and the calories of the food were all the same for both groups.

The composition of the diet was a diet plan.

After 12 weeks in this state, I checked my weight and blood pressure.

Both groups lost weight and experienced a decrease in blood pressure, but there was no significant difference.

So, if the amount of food you eat in a day, the types of food, and the calories of the food are the same,

It doesn't really make much difference whether you eat most of it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

From a dieting perspective, not eating dinner may not be good for your diet.

Why is not eating dinner not good for dieting?

It's because of consistency.

In the past, I thought that any method was an effective diet as long as it resulted in weight loss.

Recently, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of sustainable dieting.

The reason people become obese in the first place is due to issues with their lifestyle patterns and eating habits.

To diet, it is necessary to improve this lifestyle pattern and eating habits.

Reaching your target weight or body shape means you have succeeded in your diet.

If you return to your original lifestyle and eating habits, it's only natural that you would gain weight again.

Simply put, a person who has become obese by not exercising and eating only junk food every day.

Even if you succeed in dieting through a diet plan and exercise,

If you stop exercising again and eat junk food, you will gain weight.

Therefore, dieting should be done in a sustainable way, not through extreme methods.

However, a diet that involves skipping dinner is almost impossible to maintain.

Most people schedule appointments for the evening because mornings are busy and hectic.

Even if it's not a promise with someone else,

Having meals with family is more convenient in the evening than in the busy morning.

For the sake of dieting, I can refrain from eating dinner for a certain period of time, but...

It is almost impossible to never have dinner for a lifetime.

Then someday, we will have dinner.

That means there is a possibility of a yo-yo effect.

Not eating dinner does not necessarily lead to weight loss effects.

There's no need to insist on not having dinner.

I know that skipping dinner doesn't have a dieting effect, but isn't it good for health?

When you sleep at night, your digestive system also needs to rest.

If you eat food in the evening, you have to digest it while you sleep at night.

When the digestive system works to digest food, the body cannot rest.

They say that when the body doesn't get enough rest, various health problems can arise.

Symptoms such as migraines, tinnitus, and heartburn.

On the contrary, many people say that their symptoms improved when they didn't have dinner.

First of all, if you sleep before your food has digested, your digestive system has to work on digestion while you are sleeping.

It is true that health problems can arise because of that.

It is true that symptoms such as migraines, tinnitus, and heartburn are representative.

However, if you sleep before digesting your food...

The food eaten at that time is not dinner, but a late-night snack.

Late-night snacks are the problem, not dinner.

How do you distinguish between a late-night snack and dinner?

It can be divided into the time for eating and the time for sleeping.

Generally, the food we eat takes about 4 hours to digest.

If I sleep within 4 hours after eating, digestion will continue while I am sleeping.

Then, the health issues mentioned earlier will arise.

On the other hand, if I eat food and then go to sleep 4 hours later,

Since it is already digested, it does not digest while sleeping.

Therefore, there are no health issues.

Simply put, if you eat food and then sleep within four hours, it counts as having a late-night snack.

If you sleep four hours after eating, it means you have had dinner.

So to summarize...

It takes about 4 hours for food to be digested.

If you sleep within 4 hours after eating,

To digest that food, the digestive system works while you sleep.

This can lead to various health problems.

Food eaten this way is called a late-night snack.

Late-night snacks are not good for health or dieting.

Therefore, it is advisable to finish your last meal 4 hours before sleeping.

And if you finish eating 4 hours before sleeping,

Whether you have dinner or not, it doesn't make much difference in dieting.

It is difficult to maintain a lifestyle of not eating dinner for a lifetime.

It's hard to say that skipping dinner is an effective dieting method.

You mentioned that if you change your eating habits and lifestyle to lose weight and then go back to your original habits, you will gain weight.

So does that mean I have to eat a diet plan and exercise for my entire life?

Many people dislike diet meals because they think they taste bad.

People often dislike exercising because it is hard.

So I don't want to eat diet food for a thousand years.

If you lose weight through exercise and then stop exercising, you will gain weight again.

I want to diet without exercising.

There are many cases where people talk like this.

But you don't have to worry too much.

These two topics were previously asked, and I made a response video for them.

On the top left, I will have videos about the diet, and on the top right, there will be videos about exercise.
