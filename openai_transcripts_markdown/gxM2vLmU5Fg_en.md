The reason why limbs are thin but the belly sticks out - Losing belly fat Part 4

This is the fourth video about losing belly fat.

The abdomen is the only part of the body where both visceral fat and subcutaneous fat coexist.

Depending on eating habits and lifestyle, weight can be gained in various forms.

Many people are struggling with belly fat.

In the first video, we talked about subcutaneous fat in the lower abdomen, also known as the lower belly or belly fat.

In the second and third videos, we talked about abdominal visceral fat caused by dietary habits.

In this video, we will discuss the ET body shape, also known as the tadpole belly.

I will talk about skinny obesity, where the body is thin but the belly sticks out.

Why is it that only my belly gets fat while I go to other places?

There is quite a reasonable explanation for this.

The human body has many important organs.

Basically, these organs are protected by hard bones.

The brain is protected by a hard skull.

The heart and lungs are protected by the rib cage.

However, the organs of the abdomen are certainly important organs, but they are not protected by bones.

Because the stomach is located at the center of the human body.

If there is a solid bone here, it will impose restrictions on movement.

You will be unable to bend your body forward or lean back.

So, we need to protect the organs in ways other than using bones.

The job involves fat and muscle.

"Skinny fat" refers to a condition where a person has a low body weight and appears thin, but has a high amount of body fat, indicating obesity.

If there is a lot of body fat, it is natural for the weight to be high, but what is the reason for being able to have a low body weight?

It is because there is a low amount of muscle mass that the weight is decreasing.

Because the overall muscle mass in the body is low, it is natural that the amount of abdominal muscles, or abs, is also low.

Due to the lack of abdominal muscles, the internal organs in the abdomen cannot be protected.

In this case, there arises a need for the body fat in the abdomen to increase in order to protect the organs.

As a result, there is a phenomenon where fat accumulates only in the belly, while other areas do not gain weight.

Because of this, the arms and legs become thin, but the belly sticks out.

It is said that dieting is 80% diet and 20% exercise.

And in a state of muscle deficiency, exercising itself is difficult.

I don't have much motivation to exercise.

People with normal weight obesity try to lose weight through diet alone without exercising.

I don't want to exercise, but they say diet is more important anyway.

I think we should focus more on our diet rather than exercise.

However, in the case of dry obesity, dieting with just a meal plan without exercise is less effective.

The reason why other parts of the body are thin while the belly sticks out is that there is a lack of overall muscle mass.

This is because you are only focusing on your diet without addressing the lack of muscle mass.

In this case, the amount of food consumed often decreases gradually.

I am definitely eating less, but my belly fat is not coming off easily.

Since my belly fat isn't coming off easily, I'm trying to reduce the amount of food I eat even more.

However, if the amount of food you eat decreases, it becomes difficult to build muscle.

If you don't build muscle, you'll fall into a vicious cycle where belly fat won't decrease any further.

So in the case of skinny fat, it's important to prioritize eating well and exercising first.

However, when I eat well and exercise, my weight seems to increase a lot.

Yes, that's right. But that's normal.

It was said that dry obesity is when there is a lot of body fat, making one obese, but with low muscle mass, resulting in a low weight.

So it's not like "I was thin, but after eating and exercising, I gained weight."

I am originally obese.

It is a distorted state where the person is originally obese but has reduced muscle mass and body water, resulting in only a lower weight.

Gaining weight from eating well and exercising is not actually gaining fat.

As the body returns to normal, the state of obesity becomes apparent.

To solve the problem of skinny obesity, you need to accurately recognize that you are obese.

Do I need to do abdominal exercises?

It is better to do a variety of exercises rather than just doing abdominal workouts.

Skinny obesity refers to having low overall muscle mass in the body, which results in low physical strength and cardiovascular capacity.

Due to low physical strength and cardiovascular capacity, exercise performance ability is low.

Because your exercise performance ability is low, even a little bit of exercise feels difficult, which makes you not want to exercise.

In this state, it doesn't make sense to only exercise the abdominal muscles, which are small and easily fatigued.

Even if I try, I quickly get tired and feel like giving up because it's too hard.

So what kind of exercise should I do?

It is recommended to start with light full-body exercises that can improve your strength and cardiovascular ability.

A typical example is brisk walking and running.

I need to build my abs, but should I walk or run?

The abdominal muscles are located at the center of the body.

No matter what exercise you do, you will engage your abdominal muscles.

Running also uses the abdominal muscles.

In fact, doing abdominal exercises can increase your running speed.

When overall exercise improves cardiovascular capacity and physical strength, exercise performance ability increases.

When exercise performance improves, working out becomes much easier and more enjoyable.

If I want to build my body a bit more here, you can start doing targeted exercises at that time.

Before that, doing full-body exercises is more effective.

Diet is more about nutrition than exercise. This is definitely true.

However, in cases of being skinny fat, where there is a lack of muscle, diet is just as important as exercise.

I go to other places, but I particularly have a lot of belly fat.

No matter how hard you stick to your diet, if that belly fat isn't going away...

Adding exercise can help increase your overall muscle mass.
