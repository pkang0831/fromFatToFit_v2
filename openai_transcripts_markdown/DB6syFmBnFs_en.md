This is a video responding to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

There are so many vitamins and minerals, like how magnesium is needed for calcium to be absorbed by the bones. Can you explain it simply?

To get straight to the point,

If you are eating enough unprocessed foods, you do not need additional supplements.

To help with your understanding, I will show you a fictional supplement advertisement.

There are really many people who take care of their health.

What is the most important thing to consider when taking care of your health? It's hormones!

It’s really upsetting when our kids are short.

What do you need to grow taller? You need growth hormones.

Men really work out hard, don't they?

What do you need to build muscle? You need male hormones.

Women also desire a curvy body, right?

To create a curvy body, female hormones are necessary.

And the never-ending war on dieting!! This is also related to hormones.

There are appetite-regulating hormones, and if they are not properly secreted, appetite does not stop, leading to overeating and obesity.

In the end, everything is related to hormones.

So, what is the raw material for making this hormone? It's cholesterol.

If there is a deficiency of cholesterol, hormones cannot be produced properly.

In that case, there will be issues such as not growing taller, not developing muscles, lacking volume, and becoming obese.

It must be really serious, right?

It is said that the body consumes about 2,000 to 3,000 mg of cholesterol per day.

Do you know how much cholesterol we can obtain from food?

According to a study, even eating eggs, which are high in cholesterol,

It is said that one egg contains 60mg of cholesterol.

Then you need to eat 50 eggs.

You can obtain 3,000mg of cholesterol consumed in a day from food, right?

But can we eat 50 eggs a day? We can't, right?

The cholesterol supplement contains 1,000mg of concentrated cholesterol per tablet.

If you take about 2 to 3 pills a day, you could get 2,000mg to 3,000mg, right?

Please call me right now.

There isn't really any falsehood in the advertisement that just came out.

It is true that our body uses about 2,000 to 3,000 mg of cholesterol each day.

So, should we buy low cholesterol supplements for our health?

That's not the case.

This is because the liver produces and uses 2,000 to 3,000 mg of cholesterol on its own every day.

So, you can have no cholesterol from food at all without any health issues arising.

I usually create and use it on my own.

In that case, will taking that supplement cause problems due to excess cholesterol? No, it won't.

Because when we receive cholesterol from external sources such as food and supplements,

The liver tries to adjust the concentration by reducing the production of cholesterol.

In a way, it reduces one task that needs to be done.

As the burden on the liver decreases, your condition may temporarily improve.

However, this is a temporary phenomenon that occurs due to reduced burden on the liver, so it's hard to say that health has improved.

In the advertisement earlier, it mentioned that a lack of cholesterol can lead to health problems, right?

Since it can be produced in the liver, a situation where there is a lack of cholesterol does not occur.

If there is a problem with the liver and it cannot produce cholesterol, then health issues will naturally arise.

If we assume that cholesterol is "insufficient," then naturally, health problems will arise.

An egg contains 200mg of cholesterol, but if only 60mg is absorbed, isn't that a lie?

There was a sentence that said, "According to a study."

This way, it won't be a lie.

In fact, there is research indicating that the absorption rate of cholesterol from food is 30%.

Some of the smaller eggs may contain only 180mg of cholesterol.

Combining these two, it means that there is an egg with a cholesterol absorption amount of 60mg.

So the advertisement itself is not lying.

In fact, when advertising pharmaceuticals or health supplements, lying can lead to legal issues.

So I don't lie.

However, it is possible to make people misunderstand using only facts.

In that case, how should we understand vitamins and minerals?

You can understand it in three main concepts.

First, all vitamins and minerals can cause health problems if they are deficient.

If we put this in reverse, we can say that...

The statement is that all vitamins and minerals can be beneficial to health if consumed in appropriate amounts.

If you don't take care of your diet, your health will deteriorate. If you do take care of your diet, your health will improve.

So, I heard that taking certain vitamins and minerals is good for health. This isn't new information; it's obvious.

First, do not be deceived by this.

If there is a vitamin that is difficult to obtain from food, it is because that vitamin is produced by the body itself.

The cholesterol that was briefly mentioned earlier is similar, and a representative example is vitamin D.

Vitamin D is one of the vitamins that is difficult to obtain from food, as there are few foods that contain it and the amounts are low.

The reason for this is that vitamin D is produced by the body when it is exposed to sunlight.

So, it's not that you have to take supplements just because it's hard to get vitamin D from food.

The third is the complementary relationship between vitamins and minerals.

I will quote the content mentioned in the question.

In order for calcium to be absorbed by the body, magnesium is necessary. That's correct.

And there is a certain ratio to this.

However, there's no need to think too much about it...

Let's think about it.

To absorb calcium in our bodies, magnesium is necessary.

Then, in order for the animals and plants we eat to have calcium,

Magnesium is needed to absorb calcium.

So, foods that are high in calcium also tend to be high in magnesium.

It is a natural phenomenon.

There is no need to try to eat this in a specific ratio.

When you eat foods high in calcium, you also consume a lot of magnesium, so the absorption ratio in the body is balanced.

However, if we were to extract only calcium from a food product that has a balanced ratio of nutrients to create a supplement,

The supplement has no magnesium, which is a problem.

Oh? There's no magnesium. So if we extract just magnesium again, we can make a supplement.

This time, something else is needed for calcium and magnesium to work together.

Then pulling that out again... This is a meaningless act.

If you eat the food itself, you don't need to worry about the ratio.

The problem arises because we extract and consume it like this.

To summarize,

If you eat foods rich in vitamins and minerals, such as fruits and vegetables,

There is no need to specifically take separate supplements.

Sounds plausible, right?
