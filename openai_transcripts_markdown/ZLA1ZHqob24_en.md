The reason why we crave late-night snacks when we're hungry in the early morning - How to resist late-night snacks Part 1

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I shouldn't be eating late-night snacks, but I saw a comment saying that resisting them is really difficult.

I would like to talk about late-night snacks.

There are many different reasons why one might crave late-night snacks.

If we categorize them broadly, we can divide them into three areas: eating habits, sleep disorders, and late-night snacking habits.

In this video, let's talk about issues related to eating habits.

Let's start by discussing the simplest cases that can be resolved.

There are times when the meal times and sleeping times are very different.

For example, there are cases where one has dinner at 7 PM and goes to sleep around 2 to 3 AM.

In this case, there will be a difference of about 7 to 8 hours between the time dinner is eaten and the time of going to sleep.

With this much of a time difference, it's only natural to be hungry.

So I want to eat a late-night snack.

The way to solve this is simple.

You can reduce the gap between meal times and sleep times.

The best method is to move your sleep time earlier and go to bed early.

If that's difficult, we can just push back the meal time.

However, if you postpone meal times, you'll end up eating at night, and isn't that considered a late-night snack?

It is said that one should fast after 6 o'clock.

The most basic reason why late-night snacks are not good for health and dieting is digestion.

It takes about an average of 4 hours for the food we eat to be digested.

If you sleep within 4 hours after eating, you will sleep in a state of incomplete digestion.

While you sleep, digestion takes place, and various problems can arise.

So it's not good to eat late at night and go to bed without having digested the food.

Food that is eaten this way is called a late-night snack.

So, based on going to bed at 10 PM,

Going back four hours needed for digestion.

As the idea that it's better to eat only until 6 PM has spread,

There have been claims that fasting after 6 PM can lead to weight loss and improved health.

So if you go to sleep around 2 to 3 AM...

When I had a meal around 9 to 10 PM, going back 4 hours...

I sleep four hours after my digestion is complete, so there is no issue with late-night snacks.

Of course, this lifestyle pattern of going to bed so late can cause problems.

Therefore, it is better to move your sleeping time earlier rather than postponing meal times as much as possible.

If you can't change your lifestyle of sleeping at 2 to 3 in the morning,

Having dinner at 7 PM and then eating a late-night snack in the early morning, going to bed with an upset stomach.

Rather than waking up in the middle of the night because I'm hungry after forcing myself to sleep while hungry,

It is better to delay meal times instead.

The second reason for eating late-night snacks due to eating habits is the type of food consumed.

In a previous video, there was a brief mention of late-night snacks.

There was a quite interesting comment on that video.

Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are eaten every 4 to 5 hours.

In that case, it's only natural to want to have a late-night snack.

Why is eating late-night snacks a problem?

It was a comment with this kind of content.

If we elaborate on the content of the comment a bit more,

Most companies start their work at 9 AM, so

Considering the commute time, I have breakfast before 8 AM.

The company's lunch hour is mostly from 12 to 1 o'clock.

There is a difference of about 4 to 5 hours compared to breakfast time.

Dinner time is similar too.

In Korea, dinner time is usually set around 6 PM.

There is roughly a 5-hour difference from lunchtime, which ends at 1 PM.

Of course, there are quite a few cases where I leave work at 6 and can't eat right away.

In Korea, when it comes to dinner time, people usually think of around 6 PM.

So, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I eat food with a gap of about 4 to 5 hours in between.

It is natural to feel hungry at such intervals.

If there is no problem with eating food at that interval,

It's natural to feel hungry at around 11 PM to midnight, 4 to 5 hours after having dinner.

In that case, it's only natural to want a late-night snack, isn't it? This is the content of the comment.

That's right.

This time, let's change our perspective a bit.

The average time needed to digest food is said to be 4 hours.

In that case, eating every 4 to 5 hours means that

Once the digestion of the food I ate in the morning is complete, I will have lunch right away.

It means that as soon as the digestion of the food I ate for lunch is finished, I will have dinner right away.

Eating the next meal immediately without any break right after digestion ends is

Is it normal, and is there no problem?

In that case, I don't feel hungry every 4 to 5 hours.

Is there a way to maintain a feeling of fullness for at least 6 to 7 hours?

If this is possible

Instead of eating the next meal immediately after digestion, there is a gap of 2 to 3 hours.

Eating too often doesn't happen, and the digestive system gets a chance to rest.

And even four hours after having dinner, when digestion is complete, I am not hungry.

It would be nice if I didn't have to look for late-night snacks because I'm having a hard time sleeping due to hunger.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

There are various reasons for having a late-night snack.

It can be broadly divided into three categories: eating habits, sleep disorders, and late-night snacking habits.

If there is too large a gap between the second meal time and sleep time,

It's natural to be hungry, and that's why I want to eat a late-night snack.

Go to bed earlier by moving your sleep time forward.

Postponing meal time.

It is advisable to reduce the gap between meal times and sleeping times.

The third breakfast, lunch, and dinner have an average gap of 4 to 5 hours.

Considering that the time required to digest food is 4 hours,

Eating every 4 to 5 hours is

As soon as the digestion of the food is finished, the next food is eaten immediately.

There is something wrong with this.

It can be organized like this.

I feel hungry every 4 to 5 hours, and I think it's strange to be eating food.

Don't everyone eat like that? If that's the problem, then why does everyone eat that way?

What should I do to maintain a feeling of fullness for 6 to 7 hours?

You need to change the types of food you eat.

Processed foods increase appetite and create false hunger.

This fake hunger makes me eat often and a lot.

In modern society, consuming processed foods has become a common occurrence.

So feeling hungry every 4 to 5 hours and having meals has become a routine.

This is why the global population of obese individuals continues to increase.

In the diet principle video I made before,

Why fake hunger occurs and how to change the types of food you eat.

I talked about it in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have a video about the principles of dieting appear in the top left.

In the next video,

I can't sleep if I don't eat a late-night snack.

I will talk about late-night snacks due to sleep disorders.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears in the top right corner.

If the video is not showing, it means we are still in the process of creating it.

Please wait a few more days.

I eat too often. The digestive system needs time to rest.

Seeing this kind of content reminds me of intermittent fasting.

Can you provide more details about intermittent fasting?

Many people often think that intermittent fasting simply means fasting for more than 16 hours.

I previously created a series of videos that explain intermittent fasting in detail.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom left.
