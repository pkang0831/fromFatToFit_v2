Is it true that sweet potatoes are more fattening than cake?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

Recently, a question was raised in the comments asking whether sweet potatoes are more fattening than cheesecake. Is this true?

First, let's summarize what the question is about.

They said they watched a video on YouTube.

In that video, 200g of sweet potato contains 65g of carbohydrates, of which 32g is sugar.

A 200g cheesecake contains 58g of carbohydrates, of which 30g is sugar.

There are different types of carbohydrates, and among them, sugars raise blood sugar levels the fastest.

Since the sugar content in sweet potatoes at 32g is higher than that in cheesecake at 30g,

It is said that sweet potatoes raise blood sugar levels faster than cheesecake, and therefore are considered a food that makes you gain more weight.

You are asking if this is correct, right? I will explain in detail.

Recent diets report that consuming a lot of carbohydrates is a cause of obesity.

Eating a lot of carbohydrates can significantly raise blood sugar levels.

When blood sugar levels rise significantly, a hormone called insulin is secreted in large amounts.

Insulin has the effect of increasing body fat.

Eating foods that significantly raise blood sugar can lead to weight gain.

Eating foods that are not like that means you will lose weight.

Carbohydrates are broadly classified into dietary fiber and sugars.

Dietary fiber is a type of carbohydrate that is not digested, so it does not raise blood sugar levels.

On the other hand, carbohydrates refer to substances made up of sugars, and they raise blood sugar levels.

The sugars mentioned in the question refer to a term that groups monosaccharides and disaccharides separately within carbohydrates.

Monosaccharides and disaccharides raise blood sugar levels more quickly, relatively speaking.

Therefore, when displaying nutritional information, it is required to indicate sugars separately from carbohydrates.

So, is sweet potato actually more fattening than real cheesecake?

No, that's not the case.

Since it is separately indicated on the nutrition label, it has lost its meaning.

There is a simple way to understand how meaningless the sugar content on nutrition labels can be.

It is to look at the sugar content in the nutrition labels of snacks and ramen.

I used to like snacks in the potato chip category.

Looking at the nutrition label of that snack, it shows that there are 16g of carbohydrates, but less than 1g of sugars.

The package of snacks has a weight of 66g, but the nutritional information is indicated per 30g.

In reality, when you eat a whole bag of this snack, you end up consuming about twice the amount of the nutritional values indicated on the label.

However, even if you eat that way, the amount of sugar you consume will not exceed 2g.

This time, let's take a look at ramen.

This is the nutrition facts label of the most famous ramen in Korea.

The total carbohydrates are 80g, but the sugars are only 4g.

So, if we consider sugar content as the standard, these snacks or instant noodles are not fattening foods.

The sugar content is less than 2g, only 4g.

Snacks and ramen are clearly foods that can make you gain weight. But why are they low in sugar?

This is because sugars are indicated separately.

With the mandatory labeling of nutritional information on food products,

Consumers have started to choose their food by referring to the nutrition label.

From the company's perspective, in order to increase product sales,

It needed to appear as a good food according to the nutritional information label.

So we improved the product by reducing the sugar content as much as possible.

So, the snacks and ramen have low sugar content.

However, if the nutrition label is not lying,

Snacks and ramen do have low sugar content, don't they?

But why do we gain weight?

This is because carbohydrates are more important than sugars.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video, carbohydrates are made up of dietary fiber and sugars.

So, excluding dietary fiber from carbohydrates, the remaining carbohydrates are all sugars.

Carbohydrates refer to substances made up of sugars, and therefore they have the effect of raising blood sugar levels.

So, even if the sugar content is low, if the carbohydrate content is high, blood sugar levels can increase significantly.

If we look again at the nutrition labels of the snacks and ramen mentioned earlier,

A bag of snacks contains 32g of carbohydrates, while a bag of ramen contains 80g of carbohydrates.

Since dietary fiber is not indicated separately,

All carbohydrates are sugars.

It has low sugar content but a lot of carbohydrates, which is why it leads to weight gain when consumed.

Now let's think about the sweet potato and cheesecake that were mentioned in the question.

The sweet potato mentioned in the question contains 65g of carbohydrates and 32g of sugars per 200g.

The cheesecake contains 58g of carbohydrates and 30g of sugars per 200g.

Unfortunately, there is no discussion about dietary fiber.

As everyone knows, sweet potatoes are a food rich in dietary fiber.

Cheesecake is not that kind of food.

In that case, the carbohydrate content excluding dietary fiber may be higher in cheesecake.

Additionally, dietary fiber has the effect of suppressing the rise in blood sugar levels.

There is an experiment comparing eating bibim-myeon alone and eating it with 210g of vegetables.

When I eat bibim-myeon on its own, my blood sugar rises to 185.

When I ate 200g of vegetables along with bibim-myeon, my blood sugar did not rise above 140.

You can determine how much the dietary fiber in 210g of vegetables suppresses blood sugar levels.

Sweet potatoes rich in dietary fiber compared to cheesecake without dietary fiber.

Of course, the blood sugar levels that rise from sweet potatoes are lower.

Therefore, cheesecake becomes a more fattening food.

Oh, it's really complicated... Do I need to know all about carbohydrates and sugars?

No, that's not the case.

Rather, knowing that it is sugar.

When you compare only that, errors occur when comparing sweet potatoes and cheesecake.

You don't need to know such complicated information; there is a simple way to distinguish that doesn't lead to errors.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make a video that explains how to distinguish between foods that cause weight gain and those that help with weight loss.
