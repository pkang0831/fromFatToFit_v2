Exercise helps with dieting vs. it doesn't - Part 3 on calories

This is the third video about calories.

In the first video, I talked about the fundamental errors of the calorie diet theory.

In the second video, a Western person working in an office...

I mentioned the reason why the daily caloric intake of a tribe that practices hunting and gathering is the same.

If you've seen that video, you might think that exercise is not helpful for dieting.

However, there are people who have lost weight by walking or running 10 km while eating the same as usual.

What happened to these people?

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it is recommended to watch them in order.

For those who haven't seen the previous video,

The reason why you can lose weight by simply adding exercise while maintaining the same amount of food intake is that exercise increases your overall energy expenditure.

It can be divided into short-term reasons and long-term reasons.

The short-term reason is that the body has not yet adapted.

There are two reasons why body fat does not decrease based on the calories burned through exercise.

The first reason is that they secure the calories needed for exercise in other ways.

The second reason is that as exercise efficiency improves, the calories burned decrease.

How to secure the calories needed for exercise.

I explained in the video why you may not lose weight even if you do exercises that burn a lot of calories.

The reason why the calories burned decrease as exercise efficiency improves is

It was explained in the second part of the calorie video.

However, a certain amount of time is needed for these two things to be applied.

You need to spend time consistently repeating your workouts to become accustomed to exercising, which will increase your efficiency.

You need to spend time consistently repeating exercise in order to trigger the response that burns calories.

So what happens to someone who has just started exercising?

Since I just started exercising, my exercise efficiency is not high, so I'm burning a lot of calories.

The reaction to preparing this many calories has not occurred yet.

It uses body fat.

So in the short term, it means that body fat is lost through the calories burned from exercise.

The reason why fat is stored in the human body in the first place is...

This is emergency food to be used when a situation suddenly arises that requires energy.

Actually maintaining the same amount of food intake

There are quite a few experiences shared about losing weight after walking or running 10km for a month.

You can consider that most of the weight loss is due to this short-term reason.

No, what I mean is that if you suddenly increase your energy expenditure by exercising...

That means using that much body fat.

Then, if you exercise, shouldn't you be continuously using body fat?

When a person who hasn't been exercising starts to work out, it is true that their energy expenditure suddenly increases.

If you continue to exercise consistently, this is no longer a sudden situation.

Since it is not an unexpected situation, we are preparing.

That's why emergency rations end up not being used.

So should I not exercise regularly and instead do it irregularly?

No, that's not the case.

There are long-term effects that occur when you consistently repeat exercise.

The long-term effect is the body's changes aimed at improving exercise efficiency.

In the second part of the video, it was mentioned that the human body changes to adapt to the environment.

If you exercise consistently, your body will change to improve exercise efficiency.

It was said that as the body changes, the calories burned through exercise decrease.

The part where the bodies change is important here.

For ships navigating the sea, they are fundamentally designed to be streamlined.

It is because a streamlined shape can pass through water with the least amount of energy.

So, the most efficient shape for aerodynamics is streamlined.

Conversely, if it is not streamlined, the efficiency of the ship is poor.

Then what does it mean when we say that the body changes to increase the efficiency of exercise?

For example, when we are doing running exercises,

If you are overweight, you may have a lot of belly fat and your weight may be heavy.

Every time I run, my belly fat shakes, and my weight is heavy, which puts a strain on my ankles.

What can I do to improve my running efficiency here?

You need to reduce belly fat to stabilize it and lose weight to lessen the impact on your ankles.

So, if we continue to repeat exercise in the long term,

Our bodies adapt to perform that movement well.

It means that you naturally lose weight in the process.

The effects that appear in the long term are stronger than those that appear in the short term.

It is more beneficial to exercise consistently rather than irregularly.

Every time I create a video related to exercise, I keep saying this.

Exercise is not about "How many calories will I burn when I do this exercise?" That's not what's important.

What's important is whether I can continue that exercise consistently without giving up.

So I can keep going steadily without giving up.

Exercising at a moderately intense level is the most beneficial for dieting.

There is meaning in consistently continuing to exercise.

There is a lady in our neighborhood pool who has been consistently swimming for several years.

You have a slightly chubby figure.

If the body changes to be able to exercise more efficiently.

Isn't that lady who swims regularly supposed to be slim?

In the next video, I will talk about this question.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the calorie 4-part video, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
