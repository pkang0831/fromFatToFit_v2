The topic of this video is about a low-carb, high-fat diet and regular diets.

This video is also a response video to the questions from the comments.

A question with the following content was posted in the comments.

The diet that Mr. pkang is following consists of stir-frying meat and vegetables for breakfast and dinner.

You mentioned that you would have a regular meal for lunch.

If the regular meal I want to have for lunch contains an excessive amount of carbohydrates (e.g., 200g).

I don't think this lunch can be low-carb.

So, does that mean I need to pay attention to the amount of carbohydrates every time I eat a regular meal?

I want to have a meal comfortably...

And you said not to worry about calories when eating meat and vegetables.

If you combine the calories from a regular lunch and the vegetables and meat from breakfast and lunch, wouldn't that mean you're eating more than your basal metabolic rate and gaining weight?

You left this question, and I will provide an answer to it.

First, let me explain the background of that question.

Among the videos I made in the past, there is one titled "How to Practice a Low-Carb, High-Fat Diet."

After watching this video, you left that question.

The content of the video is...

I want to follow a low-carb, high-fat diet, but I'm struggling because of this issue and that issue.

Many people say it like this.

So this was a video providing tips to solve those problems.

One of the tips was about lunch.

Many people, like office workers and students, have to buy their lunch outside.

In the case of such a person, it was said that they can comfortably have a regular meal for lunch and follow a diet for the rest of the time.

Looking at this, is it okay if a regular meal for lunch has a bit more carbohydrates?

Or should I be concerned about the amount of carbohydrates?

If you don't have to worry about it... Is it possible to follow a low-carb, high-fat diet while eating that?

Is the calorie issue okay?

You asked this kind of question.

To answer your question first...

As long as it doesn't exceed the range of a regular meal, it's okay if the amount of carbohydrates is slightly higher.

Instead, you should be cautious of an increase in appetite.

Let's talk about the good reasons.

The most important point in the low-carb, high-fat diet I am talking about is to reduce refined carbohydrates.

This is the cause of obesity, so if you just reduce this, you will see the effects of dieting.

The reason we need to reduce the general diet is that it includes refined carbohydrates.

It is best not to consume refined carbohydrates.

In cases where office workers or students have to buy lunch outside, it's an unavoidable situation.

If a person who originally ate three regular meals a day only eats a regular meal for lunch and follows a diet for the rest of the meals, then...

The amount of refined carbohydrates that used to be three meals' worth is reduced to just one meal's worth.

The amount you lose will result in a dieting effect.

Conversely, if the food you eat for lunch is not at the level of a regular meal, it obviously won't have a dieting effect.

For example, going to a buffet for lunch or

Order a pizza and eat it all.

Eating Korean food, but consuming 3 to 4 bowls of rice, etc.

If you eat like this, you will consume a lot of refined carbohydrates, so problems will naturally arise.

It's just a general meal level, but depending on the type of food, there are some foods that have a bit more carbohydrates.

That kind of food is fine.

It doesn't mean that it's okay to eat until you're stuffed.

You should not misunderstand this part.

The reason why you can lose weight by relatively reducing refined carbohydrates without completely cutting them out is

I discussed it in detail in my recent video titled "How to Distinguish Fatty Foods (It Varies from Person to Person)."

If you're curious about the reason, you can click the video link in the upper right and watch the video.

You need to pay special attention to the increase in appetite.

The reason for reducing the intake of refined carbohydrates is

Consuming refined carbohydrates increases appetite and leads to eating more refined carbohydrates.

It is best not to eat at all, but...

The current situation is such that, unfortunately, I have no choice but to have a regular meal for lunch.

In that case, you can eat, but be careful not to consume additional refined carbohydrates and be mindful of your appetite.

In what way does an increase in appetite become a problem?

At first, I was satisfied that I could have a regular meal for lunch.

But at some point, I want to eat one more bowl of rice.

I feel like it's okay to have one bowl of rice, so that's why I end up eating it.

After eating another bowl of rice, I feel like having a sweet cup of coffee after the meal would be nice.

When I drink coffee, I feel a bit like snacking on something like chips before dinner because my mouth feels a bit bored.

If it gets worse here, I will have to eat regular meals for dinner.

The intake of refined carbohydrates is gradually increasing like this.

So you need to be careful to avoid this happening.

The reason why consuming refined carbohydrates increases appetite is that they can cause rapid spikes and drops in blood sugar levels, leading to increased hunger and cravings.

In the video "Obesity Diet - Reasons for Gaining Weight," it was explained in detail.

If you're curious about why appetite increases, you can click the video link in the top right to watch it.

The next question is... you were worried that the basics of a low-carb, high-fat diet might not be followed.

You don't need to worry too much about this either.

The reason is that the foundation of the low-carb, high-fat diet I am talking about is that the calories should come more from fat than from carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates provide 4 kcal of energy per gram, while fats provide 9 kcal of energy per gram.

When consuming the same amount, fat produces more than twice the calories.

It's not that I'm intentionally restricting fat intake.

It is generally the case that when eating normally, the calories obtained from fat are higher.

The 200g of carbohydrates mentioned in the question contains 800 kcal of energy.

Even with just 90g of fat, it produces a similar amount of calories.

Even if the regular meal you have for lunch contains a lot of carbohydrates, it will also include a certain amount of fat.

If you add up the fats from the meals eaten in the morning and evening, it results in a situation where the calories obtained from fats exceed the total.

Lastly, you were also concerned about calories.

You just need to be careful about the increase in appetite caused by refined carbohydrates mentioned at the beginning of the video.

Because when the person asking the question makes an assumption,

It was assumed that 100% of the calories from the food consumed would be absorbed.

The energy a person consumes in a day is assumed to be based solely on their basal metabolic rate.

Both of these assumptions are incorrect.

The energy a person consumes in a day is not just based on their basal metabolic rate.

Basal metabolic rate is the energy consumed by internal organs, which is the energy expended while lying still.

However, in reality, people do not lie down all day long.

Whether it's playing games, going to school, or commuting to work, we get up and engage in activities.

There is energy called active metabolic rate that is consumed during this activity.

And when you eat food, energy called the metabolic rate is also used to digest that food.

The energy a person consumes in a day is not just based on their basal metabolic rate.

The basal metabolic rate, the digestive metabolic rate, and the exercise metabolic rate all contribute to energy expenditure, so we consume more energy than we think.

And the calories in food are not 100% absorbed by the body.

The human body is not that efficient.

What is the evidence that it is not absorbed?

After eating, once digestion is complete, it comes out as poop.

If you give this manure to plants, it has the effect of helping them grow well.

This is because there are calories that have not been absorbed in the feces.

To summarize, a person absorbs fewer calories than what they have eaten.

Because it consumes more energy than the basal metabolic rate.

If you are having one regular meal and following a different diet for the rest of your meals, you don't need to worry about calories.

Then you might be curious about the reasons for weight gain.

It is due to increased appetite caused by refined carbohydrates.

With this increased appetite, the foods I eat are sweet things like coffee and snacks.

Foods like this are extremely high in calories, even in small portions.

If you go to a convenience store, you'll see that there are many snacks that exceed 1000 kcal.

But you don't just stop at eating one of those snacks, do you?

There are many cases where carbonated drinks are consumed together, and there are also instances where two are eaten at the same time.

In that case, you would consume 1000 to 2000 kcal in one sitting.

As a snack rather than a meal.

The problem arises because the calories have increased like this.

If you are eating a regular meal and the rest of your diet, you don't need to worry too much about calories.

Sounds plausible, right?

As I was answering, I realized that most of the topics have already been covered in previous videos.

It has turned into a video that just contains a lot of links.

Many people may not be able to see the videos made a long time ago.

I think it's also good to organize and post it this way.

Thank you for watching the entire video, even though it's quite long.
