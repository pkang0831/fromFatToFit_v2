The topic of this video is the reasons why a low-sodium diet is bad.

A question similar to the one on the left screen has been posted in the comments.

This is the second video response to the question.

If you haven't watched Part 1 of the video and are unaware of the questions, please pause the screen and check the questions.

You emphasize the importance of carbohydrates and fats when dieting, but does sodium not affect the increase of body fat? Is it only responsible for retaining water and causing swelling?

There is a perception that sodium is not good when dieting, and I am curious about the reason for this.

In Part 1 of the video, we discussed in detail the relationship between sodium and body fat.

I plan to talk based on the theory of video from Part 1.

If you haven't watched Part 1 of the video, please click the link in the top right corner and make sure to watch it.

A low-sodium diet can negatively impact weight loss in several ways.

There is an issue with inhibiting body fat burning.

You might be wondering why this phenomenon occurs.

You just need to reverse the content from Part 1 of the video.

Sodium is an essential nutrient for our body and must be maintained at a constant concentration.

So when sodium intake increases, it raises the amount of body water to adjust the concentration.

When sodium intake decreases, the amount of body fluid is reduced to adjust the concentration.

I mentioned in part 1 of the video that consuming a lot of sodium increases body water.

Where does the increasing moisture come from at this time?

It was said that it is moisture created by burning body fat.

In that case, you can think of it the other way around.

I have reduced my sodium intake by following a low-sodium or salt-free diet.

Then the body water will be lost outside.

If you continue to follow a low-sodium or salt-free diet here, your body's sodium levels will remain consistently low.

However, we cannot continuously release moisture outside.

There is a limit to the amount of moisture that can be expelled.

In this case, the next step is that we do not increase the amount of body water.

When body water increases, the sodium concentration becomes diluted.

However, when body fat is burned, water content increases.

I am trying to prevent the burning of this body fat.

This is where the problems start.

What should I do to prevent the burning of body fat?

You can reduce energy consumption.

The energy a person consumes in a day is divided into basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate.

Exercise metabolic rate refers to the energy expended during physical activity.

If you want to reduce your exercise metabolism, you just need to stop exercising.

Step 1 makes you not want to exercise.

If you continue to exercise while referring to this, the recovery of your muscles will slow down.

If you keep exercising like this, you will feel dizzy and may even collapse.

It completely prevents you from being able to exercise.

In reality, there are quite a few people who faint while exercising on a low-sodium or salt-free diet.

By eliminating the metabolic rate of exercise like this,

The second type of metabolic rate refers to the energy expended in all activities excluding exercise.

To reduce the basal metabolic rate, you need to remain inactive.

So, when following a low-sodium diet, symptoms of lethargy can occur.

I don't want to do anything, I just want to lie down, and even when I work, my productivity decreases.

Next is the basal metabolic rate.

The most well-known way to reduce basal metabolic rate is muscle loss.

Muscle loss leads to a decrease in the body's muscle mass.

The functions of internal organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs decline.

The function of these internal organs must decline in order to reduce the energy consumed.

The energy consumed should be low so that fat burning does not occur.

Fat burning should not occur so that moisture does not form, which helps maintain sodium concentration.

So, you can think of it this way: everything that shouldn't happen while dieting will happen.

But this is not the end.

The next problem that arises is an increased desire for refined carbohydrate intake.

Among the energy consumption mentioned earlier,

The exercise metabolic rate can be reduced by not exercising, and the activity metabolic rate can be decreased by limiting activity levels.

Basal metabolic rate cannot reduce the amount of energy expenditure, but it cannot be completely eliminated either.

Because it uses energy from internal organs like the heart, liver, lungs, and brain.

So, you need to burn your basal metabolic rate, but when you burn body fat, water is produced.

To avoid using body fat, I plan to receive food from outside.

Appetite increases explosively.

However, the food that I crave at this time is refined carbohydrates.

When we obtain energy from food, we think of three things: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

When fat enters the body and is burned, it produces moisture in the same way.

So I don't want to eat fat.

Protein is a building block of the body, but it is not a nutrient that provides energy.

So I don't really want to eat protein either.

Then carbohydrates will remain.

Carbohydrates are divided into refined carbohydrates and unrefined carbohydrates.

A representative of unrefined carbohydrates is vegetables.

Vegetables contain a nutrient called potassium.

When potassium enters the body, it has the effect of expelling sodium.

Right now, there is a lack of sodium, which is also suppressing fat burning.

In this situation, you wouldn't eat vegetables that help expel sodium, right?

In that case, the only thing left is refined carbohydrates.

So if you follow a low-sodium or salt-free diet,

At first, the weight drops quickly and it's really great, but...

As time goes by, it becomes difficult to maintain the diet, and daily life and exercise also become challenging.

As a result, many people fail at dieting.

To summarize, as you can see in Part 1 of the video, too much sodium can interfere with dieting.

As you can see in this video, having too little sodium can also interfere with dieting.

So, while you shouldn't eat food that is too salty, there's no need to eat it blandly or without seasoning.

You can season it to your taste and enjoy.

Sounds plausible, right?
