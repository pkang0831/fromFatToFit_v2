All videos have subtitles.

There are times when you are working hard on your diet, but you don't lose weight.

In such cases, there may be an issue with the diet or

There is a problem with the exercise.

Having mental health issues or

If there is a problem with the body.

In this video, I would like to talk about situations where there are issues with the diet.

One of the common misunderstandings among many people is that

It means that all the calories from the food I ate are absorbed by my body.

So if I eat 500 calories of food, 500 calories have been absorbed by my body.

I think this way.

The calories from the food I eat are not 100% absorbed by my body.

If you think about brown rice and white rice, it becomes a bit easier to understand.

White rice is made by removing the husk of brown rice.

So, brown rice and white rice do not have much difference in carbohydrate content or calories.

However, a person who eats white rice will lose weight if they switch to brown rice.

If all the calories from the food you eat are absorbed by your body,

Whether you eat white rice or brown rice, the calorie intake is the same, so there shouldn't be a difference.

In reality, it is not like that.

How many calories from the food I ate have been absorbed by my body?

This is called the absorption rate.

This absorption rate is not fixed.

What types of food do I eat?

And how much food did I eat?

It is influenced here.

Let's take another look at the examples of brown rice and white rice that were mentioned earlier.

Brown rice has a husk, and this husk interferes with digestion and absorption.

So when you eat brown rice, digestion and absorption are slow.

Because digestion and absorption are slow, the absorption rate is low.

On the other hand, white rice has no husk, so it is digested quickly.

Because digestion is quick, the absorption rate is quite high.

In other words, the more processed the food is to facilitate quick digestion and absorption, the higher the absorption rate.

The less processed the food is, the lower the absorption rate becomes.

Processed food is referred to as refined food, while unprocessed food is called unrefined food.

Because of this absorption rate

Even if you eat the same amount of food, you can lose weight by eating unrefined foods.

Conversely, even if you eat the same amount of food, consuming refined foods can lead to weight gain.

I am working hard on my diet, but I'm not losing weight.

Then, could it be that I am eating processed foods?

It needs to be checked.

Regarding how to distinguish between refined and unrefined foods,

In the video about distinguishing between fattening foods and weight-loss foods, we talked about it in detail.

The video link is displayed in the upper right corner.

If you are curious about the classification method, you can click here to see it.

Can't I just eat by looking at the nutritional information?

That's one way to do it, but in that case, there are things you need to be careful about.

There was a comment with this kind of content posted before.

I looked at the nutrition label and it said that the sugar content is less than 1g.

I thought it was a snack that wouldn't make me gain weight.

I found it strange that I wasn't losing weight, so I checked.

The truth is that it was a fattening snack.

I received a question asking why this is happening, so I made a response video.

The video link is available in the top right corner.

If you're curious about why you're gaining weight even though your sugar intake is less than 1g, you can click here to find out.

It's good to take a look at the nutrition label, but...

There are some things that are not listed on the nutrition label.

It’s better to know a proper classification method if possible.

The amount of food consumed for the second time.

To live, a person needs organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

The energy used by such organs is referred to as the basal metabolic rate.

If this basal metabolic rate is not met, the organs will not function properly.

In this way, a person cannot live.

So when the amount of food you eat decreases, the absorption rate increases.

Since the amount of food I eat has decreased,

I am trying to absorb as much as possible to maintain my basal metabolic rate.

If that's the case, and you still can't meet your basal metabolic rate, then...

The basal metabolic rate itself decreases.

When the smartphone's battery is low

Before the smartphone turns off, lower the screen brightness to reduce battery consumption.

It's an action taken to use the smartphone a little longer in a situation where the battery is low.

Similarly, if our bodies lack food,

I aim to reduce energy consumption by lowering the functions of major organs and to survive as long as possible.

This means that if you follow what is commonly referred to as a low-calorie diet, your basal metabolic rate decreases.

So, if you follow a low-calorie diet, at first, the weight loss goes well, but...

As time passes, the absorption rate increases, allowing for more calories to be absorbed from the same food.

As the basal metabolic rate decreases, the energy consumed will also decrease.

When these two factors are balanced, weight loss does not occur.

When it comes to the quantity of food, it's easy to only think about volume or calories.

A similar phenomenon occurs with carbohydrates and proteins as well.

In the case of a ketogenic diet that severely restricts carbohydrate intake,

In the beginning, the diet goes well, but...

When done for a long time, a phenomenon occurs where weight does not decrease.

To supplement the insufficient carbohydrates, the absorption rate has increased.

So what should I do?

There are deficiencies in the diet, and that leads to an increase in absorption rates, resulting in this phenomenon.

You just need to fill in what is lacking.

In reality, when a plateau occurs, having a cheat day can sometimes resolve the plateau.

This is because cheat days help to fill in the lacking nutrients or calories.

However, rather than having a cheating day,

It would be a better approach to adjust my diet according to my body.

How to adjust your diet to fit your body.

I talked about it in detail in part 5 of the stagnation video.

The video link is displayed in the upper right corner.

If there are no issues with the diet, there may be problems with exercise, mental health, or the body.

In the next video, I will talk about cases where weight loss is not happening due to exercise issues.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of why weight isn't coming off.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
