A question about stretching has come up, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the content of the question.

If you look at the comments on stretching videos uploaded on YouTube,

I only did stretching without following a diet or exercising.

Although there is no change in weight, it's like being able to wear pants that didn't fit before.

There are comments saying that it has a dieting effect.

Is it possible to lose weight just by stretching without diet and exercise?

It's a question about this kind of content, so let's discuss it in detail.

Is it possible to lose weight just by stretching without diet and exercise?

This question is a bit difficult to answer.

Stretching is also a form of exercise.

Since you are already in a situation where you are doing stretching exercises,

The question itself has an error in asking about it without diet and exercise.

Is stretching considered exercise?

It's light exercise.

Moving the body can be divided into two categories: activity and exercise.

If you walk for 30 minutes to get to work, that walking would be considered an activity.

However, if you walk for 30 minutes as exercise, that walking becomes a workout.

Walking for 30 minutes is the same action, but what is the criterion for distinguishing between activity and exercise?

The purpose of the action.

When you move your body to achieve a different purpose, that movement becomes an activity.

If the act of moving the body itself is the goal, then that movement becomes exercise.

Let's take an example.

If walking is done to achieve the purpose of going to work, then that walking becomes an activity.

However, the act of walking for 30 minutes itself is the goal.

Continuously spinning in the same spot or

If you walk on a treadmill, no matter how much you walk, you cannot move forward.

Walking at this time counts as exercise.

Now, let's think about stretching.

Stretching is the intentional act of bending or lengthening muscles, tendons, and joints.

It's not about bending or stretching the body to achieve a different purpose.

The act of bending or stretching the body itself is the goal.

Therefore, stretching is also considered exercise.

But isn't stretching too low in intensity to be effective for weight loss?

You can think that way.

Then let's change the question.

Is it possible to lose weight with low-intensity exercises like stretching?

It is possible for people who do not exercise and have low activity levels.

Because the act of moving the body itself has meaning.

The human body has the characteristic of becoming stronger the more it is used and weaker the less it is used.

If you continue to use your muscles through exercise, your muscle mass will increase.

On the contrary, if you don't use your muscles, muscle mass decreases due to muscle loss.

A person who has lost their sight due to an accident.

We tend to rely on external information through sound.

Hearing also develops during this process.

The same goes for the brain.

One of the reasons the brain exists is to move the body.

The more you move your body, the more your brain is stimulated, and the stronger its functions become.

On the contrary, the less you move your body, the weaker your brain function becomes.

There are many studies showing that exercising actually leads to brain development, which improves IQ, memory, and concentration.

Exercise has a preventive effect against dementia.

Then, conversely, if you do not move your body...

The brain will weaken, and negative effects will arise.

The most common symptoms are severe stress and depression.

This is why light exercise is said to reduce stress and help with the treatment of depression.

These days, whether studying or working, most people do it while sitting down.

There are many more people who do not exercise than those who do.

Of course, more people are experiencing depression than in the past, but...

If depression arises from not moving your body,

Shouldn't a lot more people have had problems?

Yes, that's right.

However, the reason it doesn't go that far is because there are alternatives available.

Many people are using food to cope with the stress and depression caused by a lack of physical activity.

In reality, eating sugary foods raises blood sugar levels, which makes you feel good.

Eating spicy food releases endorphins due to the pain in the tongue, which helps reduce stress.

The problem is that the way we eat can be one of the causes of obesity.

But what happens if you move your body with stretching in such a situation?

The stress and feelings of depression caused by not moving the body will decrease.

The reason I initially wanted to eat sweet and spicy food was because of stress and feelings of depression.

Since the cause has disappeared, the desire to eat decreases.

The desire to eat has decreased, so I'm naturally eating less and losing weight.

The question was whether there is a weight loss effect just from stretching without diet and exercise.

If you lost weight by eating less, isn't that a form of dietary control?

Yes, that's right.

However, it seems that stretching is not considered as exercise.

Many people do not consider the reduction in meal quantity in this way as dietary control.

Refer to the food you want to eat instead of forcing yourself to eat diet food you don't want.

Many people think that controlling their diet means eating less while enduring hunger.

From this perspective, eating less because I don't want to eat is not dietary control.

So, while the amount of food I eat has changed, I don't think I've adjusted my diet.

This is why I'm saying that I lost weight just by doing stretching without any diet or exercise.

However, in reality, stretching itself is exercise, and the amount of food intake has also changed.

So, can I succeed in dieting just by doing stretching diligently?

It depends on the goal.

People with very low muscle mass can increase their muscle mass even with light exercise.

However, light exercise alone does not continuously increase muscle mass.

To gain more muscle, you need to increase the intensity of your workouts.

In the same concept.

A person with very low levels of activity and exercise, when doing light exercises like stretching,

As a result of that influence, the amount of food intake changes, leading to weight loss.

However, it doesn't mean that you will keep losing weight continuously.

You will lose some weight and then stop.

If you are happy with your body as it is, there is no need to further adjust your diet or exercise.

You just need to consistently do stretching.

However, if you want to reduce visceral fat further in that state, you need to improve your eating habits a bit more.

If you want to increase muscle and reduce subcutaneous fat, you need to do stronger workouts.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

Moving the body to achieve a different purpose is called activity.

Because the act of moving the body itself is what we call exercise.

Stretching, where the act of moving the body itself is the goal, is classified as exercise.

The second person's body has the characteristic of becoming stronger the more it is used and weaker the less it is used.

One of the reasons the brain exists is to move the body.

If you don't move your body, it will have a negative impact on your brain.

When the brain is negatively affected, severe stress and feelings of depression can occur.

Many people are eating more food to cope with this stress and depression.

Eating additional foods like this is one of the causes of obesity.

The third stretch is a light exercise, but since it involves moving the body,

It has the effect of reducing stress and depression caused by not moving the body.

In this case, the desire for the food that was being eaten due to stress and depression will decrease.

If your desire for food decreases and you eat less, you will naturally lose weight.

I can organize it like this.

Many people believe that dieting can only be achieved through a perfect diet and intense exercise.

That's why it's hard to start a diet.

However, even light exercises like stretching can be helpful if you just do them.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

I understand that it's good to do even light exercise.

I saw on the internet that...

I exercised while dieting.

I’ve heard that some people have become bodies that gain weight if they don’t exercise.

I'm scared to start exercising because I'm worried about how my body might change.

In the past, the same question came up, and I explained in detail why that happens.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

I want to eat, but I'm trying to hold back and eat less.

It's fascinating how resolving the reasons for wanting to eat can make you not want to eat anymore.

Can similar effects be achieved through diet instead of exercise?

Yes, it is possible.

In the past, while explaining the principles of dieting,

We talked in detail about a diet that controls appetite itself.

I will make sure to display related videos in the upper right corner.

Every time I watch a video like this,

Starting tomorrow, I really need to go on a diet, I think.

When tomorrow actually comes, I end up not doing it.

Someone had posted a similar concern in the comments before, so I made a video about it.

I think watching that video will be helpful.
