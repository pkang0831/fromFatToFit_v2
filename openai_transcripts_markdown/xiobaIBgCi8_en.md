The real signs that indicate weight loss - Weight loss process Part 1

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video without subtitles, please turn on the YouTube subtitle feature.

I have been working hard on my diet recently, and I am losing weight, but...

There are quite a few comments expressing uncertainty about whether weight loss is actually happening.

Based on the use of the term "fake weight loss,"

It seems that such terms have come up on YouTube or broadcasts.

I lost weight, but could it be that my weight loss is not genuine? This is what you are worried about, right?

So in this video,

Let's find out how to distinguish between fake weight loss and real weight loss.

First, we need to understand the types of obesity.

The types of obesity can be easily distinguished by looking at the belly.

If we examine the structure of the ship,

The innermost layer contains the organs and visceral fat.

Muscles cover that area.

This muscle is covered by subcutaneous fat again.

The skin covers the subcutaneous fat.

The types of obesity classified by looking at the abdomen are broadly divided into three categories.

The first type is visceral fat obesity.

Visceral fat is the fat located right next to the organs.

When visceral fat increases, it pushes the outer muscles outward.

The muscles that have built up push the subcutaneous fat upward, causing the belly to protrude.

Because it pushes up solid muscles, the stomach has the characteristic of swelling up like a balloon.

Because of this, my upper abdomen is protruding, and it feels hard when I touch it.

Mainly, men tend to have this type of visceral fat obesity.

Second type: subcutaneous fat obesity.

Subcutaneous fat is located outside of the muscles, which means it is fat that the muscles cannot hold in place.

So, it droops down and sways according to gravity.

As a result, it is characterized by having no upper belly and a lot of lower belly fat.

The lower belly feels soft to the touch.

Mainly, women tend to have this type of subcutaneous fat obesity.

The third type is ET-type obesity.

Weak abdominal muscles are unable to support the weight of the internal organs, which is why the belly protrudes.

Because the abdominal muscles are pushed out, it feels firm when touched.

The fact that it is the lower abdomen that is protruding, rather than the upper abdomen, distinguishes it from visceral fat obesity.

The lower abdomen protrudes, but it is not soft; the firmness is what distinguishes it from subcutaneous fat obesity.

I tend to gain weight in my lower body rather than my abdomen. What type of obesity do I have?

The only place in our body where the internal organs are located is the abdomen.

So, I only have visceral fat around my abdomen.

Fat located in areas other than the abdomen can be referred to as subcutaneous fat.

If you have a lot of fat in your lower body, it would be classified as subcutaneous fat obesity.

To aid understanding, the types of obesity have been categorized, but

It is called visceral fat obesity, and it doesn't mean that there is no subcutaneous fat.

Just because it's subcutaneous fat obesity doesn't mean there is no visceral fat.

In most cases, weight gain occurs in a mixed or complex form.

It's a difference in which ratio is higher.

For example, in the case of men, in the early stages of obesity, visceral fat primarily accumulates.

If you become severely obese, the subcutaneous fat also increases.

In the case of women, in the early stages of obesity, fat tends to accumulate primarily in the subcutaneous layer.

If you become severely obese, your visceral fat will also increase.

Returning to the original story.

Now that I know the types of obesity, I can apply it to myself.

If your belly is swollen like a balloon and feels firm when touched, it indicates visceral fat obesity.

The real signs that indicate weight loss for those with visceral fat obesity.

It is about the upper abdomen going in.

The reason for abdominal protrusion in visceral fat obesity is

This is because visceral fat is accumulating inside, pushing against the abdominal muscles.

When this visceral fat decreases, empty spaces will form inside.

Everything that exists on Earth is affected by gravity.

When there is empty space, it tends to go upwards.

So the upper belly gets pulled in.

If you have visceral fat obesity and your weight has decreased but your upper abdomen remains the same,

It's not body fat; it's water or muscle that has been lost.

It's called fake weight loss.

On the contrary, if the upper abdomen has become concave, it means that body fat is decreasing well.

Second type: subcutaneous fat obesity.

Subcutaneous fat is located just beneath the skin.

When you grab the skin with your hand, you can also grab the subcutaneous fat along with the skin.

What we commonly refer to as "life."

What are the signs that indicate true weight loss in subcutaneous fat obesity?

This is the reduction in the thickness of the flesh.

As the subcutaneous fat beneath the skin decreases,

It's about the thickness becoming thinner to the touch.

As subcutaneous fat decreases, the thickness gradually becomes thinner.

Later, it will only catch the skin.

If you have subcutaneous fat obesity and your weight has decreased, but the thickness of the fat remains the same,

It's not fat loss; it's a fake loss of water or muscle.

On the contrary, if the thickness of the fat is decreasing, it means that subcutaneous fat is being lost effectively.

How do we determine that someone is severely obese, considering they have a lot of both visceral fat and subcutaneous fat?

You can check if the upper abdomen is sinking in, just like with visceral fat obesity.

Visceral fat is the fat located right next to the organs, making it easy to convert into energy.

So, it's body fat that can increase quickly but can also decrease quickly.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is located far from the internal organs, making it difficult to convert into energy.

So it's fat that doesn't increase quickly, but also doesn't decrease quickly.

If both visceral fat and subcutaneous fat are high, visceral fat will decrease first.

You can check if your upper abdomen is going in.

Where does it hurt after the upper abdomen?

Please tell me the order in which weight loss occurs.

In the next video, I will talk about the order in which weight loss occurs.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the weight loss process video, then...

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
