Hello, this is pkang.

This is the fifth video about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In Part 1 of the video, the types of low-carb, high-fat diets are discussed.

In the second part of the video, a strange low-carb, high-fat diet is created by mixing two different meal plans.

In Part 3 of the video, refined foods and unrefined foods are discussed.

In part 4 of the video, we talked about a balanced diet.

In this video, I will talk about what I consider to be a good diet.

Since the content of the video is all connected,

You need to watch from Part 1 in order to understand the content without any misunderstandings.

For those who haven't watched Part 1, the playlist link is available in the top right corner.

By clicking, you can watch the videos in order starting from Part 1.

The best diet, in my opinion, is one that consists of unrefined foods.

It means not intentionally restricting or intentionally overconsuming any of the nutrients among carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

If this happens, as mentioned in the fourth part of the video, it will become a low-carb, high-fat diet.

The Atkins, Paleo, and ketogenic diets, which are popular in Korea, are all different from each other.

For convenience, we refer to it as the pkang diet, meaning the diet mentioned by pkang.

Don't eat too much or too little. It's easy to say...

How can I tell if the amount I'm eating right now is too much or too little?

All living beings, including humans, have signals of hunger and fullness.

This signal is designed to inform you of the nutrients your body needs.

When you crave a certain food, it's because your body needs the nutrients from that food.

However, if we eat whatever we want, there is a problem of increased body fat leading to obesity.

So we check the nutritional components of food and calculate the calories.

However, the cause of this problem is the processed foods mentioned in the third part of the video.

As mentioned in the video of Part 3,

Foods that exist in nature, if they are rich in nutrients, are digested and absorbed slowly.

If digestion and absorption are quick, the nutrients will be less.

Processed refined foods are high in nutrients and are quickly digested and absorbed.

When too many nutrients suddenly enter the body, it can't process them properly.

This causes confusion in the body, and this confusion leads to false hunger.

If you eat according to this false hunger,

The food I ate because I was hungry was actually too much, and that's why I became obese.

In modern society, in the East, rice is a staple food, while in the West, it is wheat, leading to a diet based on refined foods.

Everyone is feeling false hunger.

So if you eat according to false hunger, you end up eating too much food and becoming obese.

Because of this, the perception has arisen that one should not eat as much food as they want just because they feel hungry.

The truth is that this was due to processed foods.

When you eat unprocessed foods, you don't experience false hunger.

You will be able to trust hunger signals.

The reason I feel hungry right now is that I truly need food.

If I want to eat a certain food, that food needs to have a lot of nutrients.

So, if you're hungry, eat until you're full with unprocessed foods, and if you're full, you don't have to eat.

What should I do if I eat too much?

When talking about diet, it's the most common question I receive.

In reality, if you try eating unrefined foods, it is difficult to consume a large quantity.

After eating to a certain extent, I start to feel full and think, "Should I stop eating?"

Once you have eaten, the feeling of fullness lasts for a long time, which reduces the number of meals you have.

I gained weight because I ate like that.

For those who have followed a low-calorie or low-carbohydrate diet, weight gain may occur.

When following a low-calorie diet, the body lacks energy because of this.

Lowering the body's metabolic rate to reduce energy consumption.

At the same time, in order to obtain more energy from the same food, the absorption rate of the food is increased.

This is the hunger response, and it causes the yo-yo effect.

If the hunger response has already occurred

Even if you eat unprocessed foods, you cannot completely prevent weight cycling.

This does cause some weight gain.

If you have been on a low-calorie diet and are already experiencing hunger responses,

Unless you follow a low-calorie diet for life, you will eventually experience a yo-yo effect.

The way to address the hunger response is to eat more food, but eating more food can lead to weight gain.

Eating unprocessed foods is the best way to minimize weight cycling.

This part is unavoidable.

You may have to accept a slight increase in weight.

In the case of a low-carbohydrate diet,

Because the intake of carbohydrates is restricted, the amount of carbohydrates stored in the body decreases.

Carbohydrates are stored in the body along with water.

When the amount of carbohydrates stored in the body decreases,

As the moisture stored with carbohydrates is released, body weight decreases.

In fact, a ketogenic diet that severely restricts carbohydrates has the effect of causing rapid weight loss in the initial stages.

Many people have become interested in the ketogenic diet because of this.

The weight lost at this time is not body fat, but the weight of water that has been lost.

It's hard to say that you've lost weight because consuming carbohydrates and water can lead to recovery.

The Longo diet does not artificially restrict carbohydrate intake.

Compared to a low-carbohydrate diet, the amount of carbohydrates stored in the body is greater.

So, due to the moisture in carbohydrates, body weight can increase.

However, it's not that body fat has increased; rather, it's that water retention has increased, so it doesn't mean that you have gained weight.

In the pkang diet, do you eat more carbohydrates compared to a low-carb diet?

I understand that carbohydrates cause the secretion of insulin, and that obesity is caused by insulin.

I think it's a problem that I eat so few carbohydrates that I don't even reach a state of ketosis.

Isn't it better for dieting to eat fewer carbohydrates, even if not to that extent?

In the next video, we will discuss this question.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the sixth part of the low-carb, high-fat diet series, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
