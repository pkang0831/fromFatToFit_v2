The habit of procrastination! The reasons for continually delaying the start of a diet.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

Even if I decide to really start my diet from tomorrow,

When I wake up, I wonder where the motivation I felt the day before has gone; there is not a trace of it.

Let's start tomorrow, let's start next week, let's start next month. I keep putting it off like this.

Is there a story that would be helpful for someone like me?

A comment with this kind of content has been posted, so I would like to discuss it.

I want to diet and I think I should.

It means that you can't start and keep postponing.

The biggest reason this happens is that we do not take action.

There's a saying that the hardest part of exercising is getting to the gym.

Whenever I go to the gym, I work out hard and do well.

I don't want to go to the gym.

When you actually go to the gym, the fact that you work out hard means that you don't dislike exercising itself.

Something seems off.

It's not that I dislike exercising.

I think I need to exercise.

Why might someone dislike going to the gym?

It is because of choosing a different action.

I need to go to the gym to work out, but I didn't go because I was lazy and didn't want to.

In this story, if we set the standard in terms of exercise,

It means that it can be said that I did not exercise.

If I consider my actions as the standard,

It means that a different action was chosen instead of exercising.

Just because you don't exercise doesn't mean you're not doing anything at all.

Sitting in front of the computer and playing games or

Sitting on the sofa, watching movies or dramas,

You would be lying in bed using your smartphone.

Then why choose this behavior instead of exercising?

Because it is simple.

Let's think about going to exercise.

I need to change my clothes, go to the gym, work out for over an hour, shower, and then come back.

On the other hand, lying in bed and using a smartphone just requires you to lie down in bed.

I always carry my smartphone with me.

There are many things to do if you want to exercise, which can create a reluctance to make a choice.

Lying in bed and using a smartphone is almost without any resistance.

There are many cases where I choose without even thinking, let alone worrying.

There are many cases where we are not aware that we have made a choice.

Instead of actually going to exercise, I chose to lie in bed and use my smartphone.

I didn't even realize that I made such a choice, and I just thought that I postponed going to exercise.

Lying in bed and looking at my smartphone or

Sitting on the sofa and watching a movie or

Sitting in front of the computer and playing games.

Such behaviors are a simple pleasure approach that provides immediate rewards as soon as the action is taken.

The gap between action and reward is short, and therefore it can only be simple.

On the other hand, the things we think we should do are

If you invest time, you are meant to receive rewards later, and it can’t help but be complicated.

So when the moment of choice comes, most people tend to choose actions that provide simple pleasures.

So, you don't want to do what you have to do, and it's hard to make a choice.

However, once you start, continuing is relatively easy.

I understand that it's hard to get started.

Why does it become easier to continue once you start?

People have a desire to complete a task once they have started it.

If you actually stop in the middle of doing something,

Because of the desire to finish that task, I often find myself thinking about it continuously.

This is called the Zeigarnik effect.

The desire to finish what has been started becomes the driving force to continue that work.

Before starting, even if it was something you didn't want to do,

Once you actually try it, continuing isn't difficult.

I often feel that it ends sooner than I expected.

In reality, even though I dislike studying, doing homework, washing dishes, and cleaning, I end up procrastinating for hours or even days.

When you actually try it, it's not that difficult, and there are experiences that end quickly for everyone.

Because of this

There is inertia in behavior. Once you start, you continue.

Don't think or worry, just do it.

There are many stories like this.

I understand the reasons why it's hard to get started.

I know that once you start, continuing from there is easy, but...

The problem is that it's difficult to even get started.

Is there an easy way to get started?

You just need to simplify and focus.

For example, if you need to exercise,

Don't think about the whole process of going to the gym, working out, showering, and coming back.

Focus only on the part about going to the gym at the beginning.

Let's just go to the entrance of the gym.

If you really can't exercise, then let's just go back.

If you want to play games, watch movies, and lie down in bed,

Let's go to the gym entrance and then come back.

Going to the gym entrance isn't difficult, and it doesn't take much time, so let's just go and come back.

The goal is to simplify things as much as possible and reduce the burden, so that we can focus on starting in any way we can.

If you just go to the entrance of the gym.

Because of my desire to finish, since I came to the gym anyway, let's work out and go.

I come to think this way.

If I'm going to exercise anyway, I think I might as well do it properly and with effort.

So it's hard to go to the gym. When I go to the gym, I end up working out hard.

For any task, there is the simplest action that needs to be taken first to get started.

Let's not think about anything else and just focus on that action.

I understand what you mean, but...

I'm not sure how to start a diet.

I have created various diet theories in videos up until now.

Among those theories, you can start with the ones that you can do most easily without any pressure.

For example,

After eating a hearty late-night snack, there are times when you feel the need to go on a diet.

In general, in such cases,

Since I have already had a late-night snack, I think there is nothing I can do right now.

So I'm thinking that I'll start my diet from tomorrow.

But please don't do that; take action right away.

If you have vinegar, mix a spoonful in water and drink it.

If you don't have vinegar, go out and walk for at least 10 to 20 minutes.

If you can't go out, please don't lie down or sit; you can at least stand up and walk in place.

While lying down to sleep and watching YouTube, if I start to think that I need to go on a diet...

To get even a little bit of good sleep, turn off your smartphone right now and go to bed.

If you are unable to follow a diet plan,

You can simply continue eating the foods you normally eat and just add more salad.

It is not necessary to do it thoroughly and perfectly for a diet to be effective.

If I do what I can, my body will change accordingly.

When your body changes, dieting becomes easier and easier.

In a state of not taking any action.

Let's work hard starting tomorrow. Just making a resolution with words won't be enough.

Since my body doesn't change, I keep postponing it to the next day again.

Please don't do that.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

The first thing we think we should do is to not receive rewards immediately upon taking action.

It's a method of investing time and receiving rewards later.

This makes me feel reluctant to choose to act that way.

Immediate rewards from simple pleasures that involve acting in the opposite way do not create any aversion to choice.

Therefore, when the moment of choice comes, most people tend to choose simple pleasures.

The task that needs to be done because of this is difficult to start.

The second person has a desire to finish what they have started.

Once you start something, continuing it is relatively easy.

So the things we feel we have to do are mostly the hardest to start.

Starting the third diet is also the hardest part.

It is important to start somehow.

Therefore, find the simplest thing you can do right now.

It's better to start right away without procrastinating.

I can organize it like this.

I understand that starting is important.

I understand that you suggest trying the easiest diet method to get started somehow.

Is it effective to diet in an easy way?

No matter the method, as long as you take action, there will definitely be an effect, whether big or small.

There are even cases where just changing your mindset leads to weight loss.

It's a story about an experiment conducted on housekeepers.

I talked about it in another video before.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

If you're curious about the experiment where simply changing your mindset led to weight loss, you can click here to see it.

You said to mix a spoonful of vinegar in water and drink it.

Why are you asking me to do that?

Vinegar itself is helpful for dieting.

The diet effects of vinegar were discussed in detail in a series previously.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right.

Why vinegar is helpful for dieting.

You also mentioned that I should walk for at least 10 to 20 minutes.

Is just walking meaningful if it's not proper exercise?

There is significance in walking after a meal.

In fact, without doing anything else, I consistently walked for 10 minutes after meals.

There is also an experiment that shows a weight loss of 3 kg in a month.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom left.

If it's difficult to stick to a diet,

You mentioned that I should continue eating the same foods I used to eat while also adding salads.

Does that help with dieting?

It's like adding extra calories equivalent to a salad.

Shouldn't you eat less of the food you usually eat after filling up with salad?

Eating the same foods you normally eat while adding just a salad can also help with dieting.

The reason vegetables are good for dieting in the first place is not because they are low in calories.
