Ways to Solve Insomnia and Sleep Better

Hello, this is pkang.

This is a video responding to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

As someone in a creative profession, I find it difficult to sleep because I'm constantly thinking about stories. I want to overcome this insomnia without the help of medication.

To summarize the question, it is about wanting to cure insomnia without medication.

Insomnia has a wide variety of causes, so there is no perfect solution.

I will discuss a few methods that can help with insomnia.

First of all, if I don't separate my work space from my relaxation space,

Similar symptoms may occur in the questioner.

People perceive, hear, and feel much more information than they think they do.

Such information is not processed clearly, but rather is handled vaguely in the subconscious.

If you are trained to recognize and interpret this information,

It is possible to read the situation and psychology without directly talking.

Cold reading is the ability to read situations, thoughts, and psychology through expressions, tone of voice, clothing, and body language.

Observing the living space, belongings, etc., is called snooping.

There are many cases where dramas are created based on people with such maximized abilities.

The main character of the American drama "The Mentalist," Patrick Jane, or

The main character of the British drama Sherlock is a representative example.

Not everyone is Sherlock or Patrick Jane, but to some extent, everyone has this ability.

So, it's possible to understand the situation through intuition and the atmosphere, even without speaking.

The information obtained in this way has a significant impact on behavior and psychology.

The space where I work is perceived as a place where I unconsciously do my work.

If you try to relax in this space, you may unconsciously be disturbed.

Students who do housework or study at home, and people who work from home.

Because the home is perceived as a space for work, rest is unconsciously disrupted.

Even when I try to relax, I think about the laundry I need to do and the dishes I have to wash.

Students think about studying for exams and homework, while remote workers are concerned about their work.

Even if you don't actually do that work, it still keeps bothering you.

I feel stressed because I have a heavy heart with the thought of whether it's okay to take a break like this.

So even if the body is resting, the mind is in a situation where it can't truly relax.

The body is affected by the mind, so the body is not able to recover properly.

So, a person who does not work from home

I want to relax at home on my day off, but...

A person doing household chores, a remote worker. In the case of a student studying at home...

I tend to prefer going outside on my days off.

Recently, as the number of single-person households has increased, most people are doing household chores.

Because I perceive my home as a space for work, I prefer to leave the house to relax.

With the development of low-cost airlines, airfares have become cheaper, and the desire to overeat has increased through social media.

There is also a claim that more and more people are leaving home to go on trips.

Travel is not only about relaxation but also about experiencing new environments.

Recently, I have been focusing more on rest rather than new experiences.

Traveling to a nearby hotel for a vacation is becoming popular.

Considering this point, it is not entirely unrelated.

Based on the content up to this point, if we look back at the questions and comments...

You mentioned that you have been lying down and thinking of stories in order to fall asleep for the past eight years.

It is highly likely that this habit has caused insomnia.

There are three main ways to solve it without medication.

The first method is to separate the workspace and the relaxation space as much as possible.

Right now, I am working on thinking of stories while lying in bed.

The bed has been recognized as a space for work, which may make it difficult to fall asleep.

In this case, you should rent a separate office.

Sometimes, the issue can be resolved by working only in the office and resting at home.

If it's difficult to find an office, you can separate it into a workroom and a relaxation room.

If you are living in a one-room apartment or an officetel, you can separate the space between the computer desk and the bed.

The important point is that work should never be brought into the relaxation space.

This method is more effective the more isolated the space is, and the less isolated it is, the weaker the effect.

Completely separating the office from home is the most effective approach.

In the same room, the effectiveness is relatively weak for the desk and the bed.

The second is habit.

If you repeatedly engage in certain actions before going to sleep,

There are cases where habits are formed because one unconsciously remembers that they sleep after that behavior.

For example, if you repeatedly eat a late-night snack and then go to sleep afterwards,

Sometimes, if I don't eat a late-night snack, I feel empty in my stomach and can't fall asleep.

I started drinking warm tea because I heard it was good for a good night's sleep, and then I began to sleep afterward.

If you don't drink tea, there are times when you can't sleep well.

If you develop a habit of sleeping while listening to music, you won't be able to fall asleep without it.

If you develop a habit of sleeping after reading a book, you won't be able to fall asleep without reading.

The questioner has been lying down to think of stories and then sleeping afterward.

If it has become a habit to think of a story before going to sleep,

If you don't think of a story, there is a possibility that you won't be able to sleep.

In this case, the first method of spatial isolation does not solve the problem either.

Because in order to sleep, I need to think of stories in bed.

If I think of stories in bed, the bed becomes a workspace.

In this case, creating habits is more helpful than spatial isolation.

Not being able to sleep if you don't engage in habitual behaviors means that

On the contrary, it means that if you engage in habitual behavior, you can sleep well.

So, intentionally creating habits.

If I want to sleep, this is how to engage in that habit.

There are a few rules to follow when creating a habit.

No tools or preparations will be needed for the first one.

A friend of mine informed their parents about smartphone usage.

Before going to bed, play a game of Go-Stop for fun and then sleep.

One day, my smartphone broke, and I couldn't play games anymore.

They say they couldn't sleep well at night because they couldn't fall asleep.

I have developed a habit of drinking tea, but there are times when I run out of tea.

In this case, I feel sleepy and want to go to sleep right away, but I have to go out to the convenience store to buy a drink.

So it's good to have habits that you can do right away without needing tools or preparation.

It will be an action that is not performed during the second day.

To establish a habit, you need to take action and then sleep.

If you engage in activities during the day and take a nap, it can be difficult to sleep at night.

If you act during the day and don't sleep, habits won't be formed.

Choose an action that you only do before going to bed, not during the day.

The third one can be done anywhere.

There are also times when I sleep with someone else, such as staying at a friend's house or going on a trip.

It is better not to make actions that are embarrassing in front of others a habit.

However, to form a habit, you need to take action and then sleep afterward.

In severe cases of insomnia, it may be impossible to fall asleep at all.

In this case, a habit itself is not formed, so for some people, this method can be difficult to use.

The last third method is to simplify your thoughts.

It is often said that when you can't fall asleep, you should count sheep, one sheep, two sheep.

It is a method to eliminate distracting thoughts in your mind by focusing your thoughts on counting numbers.

When you eliminate distracting thoughts, it helps you get a good night's sleep.

However, in the case of increasingly large numbers, there are instances where thinking does not become simplified.

People unconsciously try to get the right answer because of this.

To avoid making mistakes while counting numbers, I remember the numbers and think of the next one.

As a result, it can actually complicate your thoughts.

However, the bigger problem is that as the numbers increase, it becomes possible to understand the passage of time.

When the numbers increase to 500, 1000, it means that much time has passed.

As the numbers get larger, I start to think, "It's been a long time, and I still can't fall asleep."

I start to feel increasingly anxious thinking, "If I fall asleep right now, I won't be able to sleep for long anyway."

Anxiety interferes with deep sleep, which makes insomnia worse.

The way to solve this is to count by inhaling for one and exhaling for two.

Since it only repeats one and two, there’s no confusion or forgetting.

Because the numbers do not increase, we cannot tell the passage of time.

If you keep repeating one, two according to your breath, distracting thoughts will disappear and your body will relax.

This can help in resolving insomnia.

It doesn't necessarily have to be done in a one-two manner based on breathing.

As my body relaxes completely, I feel like I'm sinking into the bed.

If it's a way to clear my mind of all thoughts, anything is fine.

Sounds plausible, right?
