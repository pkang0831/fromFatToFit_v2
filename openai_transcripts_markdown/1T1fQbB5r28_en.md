Hello, this is pkang.

This is a video responding to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

I recommend that you read the book.

I read the book "The Criminal is Fat."

To summarize the entire content briefly,

The author of the book uses a diet called natural plant-based eating.

Experiences of treating patients with cardiovascular diseases and the individual stories of each patient.

This is a book that explains what a natural plant-based diet is and why one should follow it.

The rest of the content, excluding this part, suggests that one should not eat meat and that it is better to follow a vegetarian diet.

This content is very similar to what I reviewed before.

If we cover all of this part, the content will be too repetitive.

I will talk about the reasons why we should adopt a natural plant-based diet, which is the main focus of this book.

If you're curious about the review of a certain vegetarian doctor's confession, the video link is available in the top right corner, so please click to watch it.

In this video, we will discuss the reasons why the author of the book advocates for a natural plant-based diet.

I will share my thoughts on the reason for that.

The author of the book states that there are three main reasons to adopt a natural plant-based diet.

You should not eat processed refined foods because they can cause health problems.

If your second blood cholesterol level becomes excessively high, it can lead to health problems, so you should avoid eating foods high in cholesterol.

If excessive body fat accumulates, it becomes a problem, so you should avoid eating foods that contain fat.

A diet that adheres to all three of these prohibitions is called a natural plant-based diet.

So, it's about a natural diet that doesn't include processed foods.

Combining a plant-based diet that does not include animal products containing cholesterol.

You can consider this a diet that prohibits all fats, regardless of whether they are plant-based or animal-based.

My thoughts on this are...

Eating processed refined foods can lead to health problems, so it is advised not to consume them.

I completely agree with what I have been saying in other videos.

However, if you eat foods that contain cholesterol, it is said that cholesterol accumulates in the body, so you shouldn't eat them.

Eating foods that are high in fat can lead to fat accumulation in the body, so it should be avoided.

I have different thoughts on these two matters.

The topic of cholesterol and fat has been covered in other videos, so it's repetitive.

Since this is the main content that forms the backbone of the book, please understand that it is necessary for the book review.

First of all, it is true that if blood cholesterol levels become too high, health problems can arise.

However, eating foods that contain cholesterol does not necessarily raise blood cholesterol levels.

Cholesterol is used extensively because it is a raw material for hormone production.

I use about 2000 to 3000 mg per day.

A vegetarian who does not eat any animal products that contain cholesterol.

A lack of cholesterol does not cause health problems.

Why is this happening? So I checked the person's body and...

The liver produces and uses 2000 to 3000 mg daily.

The important thing here is that the amount of cholesterol produced by the liver is not always fixed.

When I eat foods that contain cholesterol, the liver reduces its production.

If I don't eat foods that contain cholesterol, my liver increases its production to compensate.

So, in order for the food that contains cholesterol to have any negative impact on my body,

You need to consume more than what is produced by the liver.

However, the cholesterol in food is in small amounts.

It's not absorbed 100% by the body.

Because the amount produced by the liver is so large,

The cholesterol in the food you eat does not cause an increase in blood cholesterol levels.

In the past, when people were unaware of such facts, they believed that eating foods high in cholesterol was bad for health if consumed in large amounts.

There have been recommendations in various countries to consume less than 300mg per day.

However, after that, as a result of continuing research on blood cholesterol and cholesterol-containing foods,

Many results have come out indicating that there is no correlation.

So in 2015, the recommendations in the United States and Japan advised to consume less than 300mg of cholesterol.

It has been completely deleted.

And this information became known in Korea in 2015.

A representative food high in cholesterol is eggs.

There was a lot of commotion as it was said that eggs have been cleared of their wrongful reputation after 40 years.

So, when you eat foods that contain cholesterol, your cholesterol levels increase.

It is not true that you should not eat foods that contain cholesterol.

It is true that having an excess amount of fat in the body can lead to health problems.

However, the reason for the accumulation of body fat cannot simply be attributed to the fat in food.

A diet that provides more calories from fat than from carbohydrates.

It is called a low-carb, high-fat diet.

There are many different types of low-carb, high-fat diets.

There is a diet called ketogenic.

The ketogenic diet restricts carbohydrates to a deficient level.

It is a diet that intentionally includes a lot of fat.

Then, if it is true that the fat in the food I eat is causing an increase in body fat,

The ketogenic diet can absolutely have no effect on weight loss.

It should be a diet that increases body fat, right?

However, there are quite a few people in Korea who have successfully lost weight with the ketogenic diet.

Of course, the ketogenic diet has various side effects and issues.

There are also issues that arise from a lack of carbohydrates, making it difficult to sustain.

The important point here is

It is an important example that eating foods with fat does not necessarily lead to an increase in body fat.

If cholesterol and fat in food are not the problem, what causes cholesterol and fat to accumulate in the body?

It is due to processed refined carbohydrates.

Refined carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels very quickly and significantly.

If high blood sugar levels are maintained, inflammation occurs, leading to disease.

The body naturally has to prevent this phenomenon.

So, in order to lower blood sugar, more insulin is secreted additionally.

The additional insulin secreted in this way converts glucose in the blood into fat and then stores it in fat cells.

If there had been no additional insulin secreted, the fats that were not absorbed by the body would also be stored in fat cells.

It increases the production of cholesterol.

Conversely, if we had not consumed refined carbohydrates...

The blood sugar likely did not rise sharply or significantly.

Insulin would not have been secreted additionally.

In that case, the glucose in the blood would not have turned into fat.

The fat that has not been absorbed would not have become body fat, right?

Similarly, cholesterol would not have been produced additionally.

So you can see the cause as refined carbohydrates.

In the book "The Criminal is Fat,"

There are accounts of treating diseases with a natural plant-based diet that excludes cholesterol and fats.

If the content of the video is correct, does that mean the personal experiences are lies?

No, it's not a lie. In fact, a natural plant-based diet is likely to be effective.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video, a natural plant-based diet has three main conditions.

I will not eat refined carbohydrates.

I will not eat foods that contain cholesterol.

I will not eat food that contains third-party fat.

As I mentioned, cholesterol and fat do not actually have an impact, so let's exclude them.

The important thing is that such effects occur because refined carbohydrates were not consumed.

The reason cholesterol and body fat accumulate in the body is due to refined carbohydrates.

A natural plant-based diet does not include refined carbohydrates, so it naturally leads to a reduction in cholesterol and body fat.

To summarize,

The experiences mentioned in the book "The Criminal is Fat" are true, and a natural plant-based diet is indeed effective.

The reason it is effective is that it is a natural diet that does not include refined carbohydrates.

It is not because they do not eat foods that contain cholesterol and fat.

Sounds plausible, right?
