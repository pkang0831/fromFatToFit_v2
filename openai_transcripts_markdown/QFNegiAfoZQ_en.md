Are you on a low-carb, high-fat diet but not losing weight? - Glucagon Part 3

This is the third video about the weight-loss hormone glucagon.

Glucagon is a hormone that performs the opposite function of insulin.

When insulin increases, glucagon decreases, and when insulin decreases, glucagon increases.

In the first and second videos, depending on the interval and amount of food consumed,

We talked about how insulin and glucagon work.

Since it is related to the principles of intermittent fasting, I explained it based on intermittent fasting.

In this video, I would like to talk about the nutrients we consume.

This content is related to a low-carb, high-fat diet.

The nutrients we obtain from food are very diverse, but

The main nutrients discussed in dieting are carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, which are three in total.

I conducted an experiment observing these three nutrients along with insulin and glucagon.

In the case of carbohydrates, they raise blood sugar levels, which induces the highest secretion of insulin.

After that, insulin was secreted in the order of protein and fat.

One of the functions of insulin is to lower elevated blood sugar levels.

It reacted the most to carbohydrates.

The reason you need to reduce carbohydrates in a low-carb, high-fat diet is this.

When you eat carbohydrates, insulin increases, leading to an increase in body fat and heightened appetite.

If you don't eat carbohydrates, insulin decreases and glucagon increases.

It means that body fat decreases and appetite is controlled.

If you are diligently following a low-carb, high-fat diet but not seeing good results in your weight loss, there are three main reasons for this.

The first issue is with carbohydrates and sugars.

First, the term "carbohydrate" refers to substances made up of sugars.

Sugars refer to the carbohydrates that raise blood sugar levels the most.

In the case of Korea, the nutrition label only indicates sugars without listing carbohydrates.

Foods high in sugar are often thought to be fattening, while foods low in sugar are mistakenly considered to be okay.

Non-sugar carbohydrates also raise blood sugar levels.

Foods that are low in sugar but high in carbohydrates can raise blood sugar levels, reduce glucagon, and contribute to weight gain.

People who are not well-informed about this may think that it's okay to eat as long as the sugar content is low.

If the carbohydrate intake is high, dieting will not be effective.

In fact, someone commented that they were surprised after eating the snack, thinking it was low in sugar and feeling at ease.

So, I also created a video explaining sugars and carbohydrates.

The link to the video is displayed in the top right corner.

Please refer to the video and be cautious.

The second case is when the intake of carbohydrates is too low.

The term "low-carb high-fat diet" can easily be misunderstood as referring to a single type of diet.

In fact, the low-carb, high-fat diet is a concept that falls under a very large category.

According to the rules within it, there are various different diets that exist.

Even just listing the famous diets in the country,

There are three types of diets: the Atkins diet, the Paleo diet, and the ketogenic diet.

Among them, the ketogenic diet, which severely restricts carbohydrates, is the most famous.

The reason is that I believe the more you reduce carbohydrates, the better the diet will be.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video, carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels.

Increased blood sugar raises insulin levels and lowers glucagon.

To put it simply, if we reverse this,

The more you avoid eating carbohydrates, the more it can be perceived as good for dieting.

However, that's not actually the case.

It is true that too many carbohydrates can lead to obesity and are not good for our health, but...

Carbohydrates are also essential nutrients for our body.

Severely restricting this itself is a very stressful act.

When our body is under stress, a hormone called cortisol is released.

The role of cortisol is to increase blood sugar levels and increase body fat.

And if carbohydrate intake is too low, feelings of depression can become more severe.

As mentioned in the eighth episode of the eating disorder series, feelings of depression can lead to binge eating.

So, while restricting carbohydrates can help control appetite, it can also lead to cravings for binge eating.

Sometimes dieting doesn't work, or it can even lead to weight gain.

On the contrary, eating a bit more carbohydrates helps control my appetite and can aid in dieting.

As mentioned in Part 1 of the glucagon video,

The human body does not operate solely through the mechanisms of insulin and glycogen.

Because an incredibly large number of mechanisms are mixed together and operating,

Simply eating fewer carbohydrates reduces insulin and increases glucagon, leading to weight loss.

Interpreting it this way leads to an error.

Eating too many carbohydrates is definitely a cause of obesity, and it is necessary to reduce them, but...

Extremely restricting yourself is not the best diet.

This part was covered in detail in the low-carb, high-fat diet series.

Processing of the last third food.

To summarize what has been discussed so far,

In the end, eating a lot and frequently means that many nutrients are coming into the body.

By increasing insulin and decreasing glucagon, it hinders dieting and makes us obese.

However, in the case of food that exists in nature, that becomes impossible.

If you can eat often and a lot, the nutritional density is low, so the nutrients that enter the body are few.

If the nutrient density is high, it means that digestion and absorption are not very efficient, resulting in fewer nutrients entering the body.

However, it allows us to consume foods that we wouldn't be able to eat in large quantities through processing.

If you make foods that are slow to digest and absorb into ones that digest and absorb quickly,

These foods make us obese and hinder our dieting efforts.

Reducing processed foods is the most important aspect of dieting.
