The reason why you don't lose weight even when you eat less.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I am eating less than before, but I am not losing weight; instead, I am gaining weight.

A comment with this kind of story has been posted, so I would like to discuss it a bit.

First, let's unravel the story from the comments.

It's been two weeks since I made some changes to my diet, and it's been almost two months since I started doing some exercise.

I am gaining weight gradually. My pants have become tighter.

I eat salad for lunch three times a week.

I do Pilates twice a week with enough intensity to make my legs shake.

Why am I getting heavier and gaining weight in my face?

I feel like I'm eating less than before, and it's frustrating. I have no one to vent to.

I have never been this serious before.

I gained a maximum of about 3 kg, and even that, I always returned to 50 kg without much effort.

This time, I gained 10 kg for the first time, and the first digit is now 6.

What could have happened?

I ate delivery food for lunch every day for 5 months. Could that be the cause?

A single serving of delivery food is quite a lot.

The amount of dinner eaten at home has also increased significantly.

Is a lunchbox the answer? I managed to lose 44 kg with a lunchbox diet.

300g of vegetables, a fistful of rice, a fistful of meat. Eating like this can help with weight loss, but...

To eat like that, one must have obsessive symptoms; otherwise, it's hard to make that decision.

I used to eat like that when I was under a lot of study stress.

At that time, I lost 5 to 6 kg in 3 months from 50 kg.

That was five years ago.

Even during the time when I was attending study sessions and skipping dinner, I weighed 47 kg, but that was two years ago.

I can't believe I'm now 60kg...

I thought my weight was 50kg... Could it be because of age-related weight gain?

I just thought I would gain weight based on how much I eat, so I ate as I wanted.

If you eat a lot, your weight will increase accordingly.

I thought it would stop once it reached a certain level of pressure.

I thought it was 53kg, but it became 55kg, then 57kg, and now it has reached 60kg.

There seems to be a limit to what can be lost, but there doesn't seem to be a limit to what can be gained.

I plan to try eating salad with intermittent fasting, and if that doesn't work out, I will prepare a packed lunch.

This is the content of the comment.

First of all, the reason I am making a video with this story is...

This is a typical process where many people gain weight, decide to go on a diet, and then fail at dieting.

The reason for gaining weight in this story.

What problems are there with dieting methods?

I think discussing this would be helpful for others as well.

First of all, the reason I gained weight, as I suspected, is indeed because I ate delivery food for lunch for five months.

To be precise, it's because the amount of food I eat has gradually increased due to eating delivery food.

I refer to processed foods like delivery food as fattening foods.

Foods like this have the effect of increasing appetite.

Due to this increased appetite, the amount of food consumed has increased.

Obesity is caused by an increased amount of food intake.

In reality, when you look at the stories, even a single serving of delivery food is quite large.

Since I've been eating that kind of delivery food for lunch,

It is said that the amount of dinner eaten at home has also increased.

The increase in appetite due to delivery food and the overall increase in the amount of food consumed are the causes of obesity.

Then, I eat salad for lunch three days a week.

I work out with Pilates two days a week, but why am I not losing weight?

This is because there is a problem with that very approach.

Until just yesterday, I was eating a lot of delivery food during lunch.

If you suddenly tell me to eat only salad starting today,

Due to the psychology of compensation, there are often times when my meal portions increase during the remaining time when I'm not eating salad.

I'm eating salad to diet, but does it make sense to eat a lot of food at other times?

Even if the desire to eat arises, you should rationally hold back.

Unfortunately, the desire to eat does not confront my reason directly.

When I read the story again,

The person sharing the story knows that delivery food comes in large portions for one serving.

Since I've been eating a lot of delivery food for lunch,

The person sharing their story is also aware that the amount of dinner eaten at home is increasing.

No one is unaware that eating a lot of food leads to weight gain.

Of course, the person sharing the story will be able to understand it as well.

But in the end, I ate a lot and gained weight.

Why did this happen?

It's because my desire to eat is contaminating my reason.

I can't live my whole life on a diet.

So it's okay to eat comfortably, and a slight increase in weight is unavoidable.

There will be limits, so once I gain a certain amount of weight, I will probably stop there.

They must have had their own reasoning for being able to eat more food like this.

You probably thought this was a rational judgment.

So I became 53kg, then 55kg, then 57kg, and finally 60kg.

It's not a battle between the desire to eat a lot and the rationality that says you shouldn't.

Desires contaminate reason, leading one to twist their thinking to justify that it's okay to indulge.

It's not just the person sharing their story.

Many people show this kind of appearance.

If you look at the story of the flight attendant that was previously made into a video,

Due to the nature of the job as a flight attendant, dieting is necessary.

During meal times, I eat chicken breast and sweet potatoes, but

When others weren't watching, I was eating snacks and cake.

In addition, those who have successfully lost weight once and then experienced a rebound.

I know how to diet, so it's okay if I gain a little weight.

I can go on a diet anytime I set my mind to it.

It's just that I'm not thinking about dieting right now.

I sometimes think like this.

People who used to exercise a lot and then stop can gain weight.

Even someone like this can start dieting as soon as I exercise.

Gaining a little weight right now is okay.

I just think that I'm not planning to diet right now.

Since I had salad for lunch, it's okay to eat a bit more for dinner.

I only had salad for lunch, so it's hard to concentrate on work in the afternoon.

I have to work, so I'll just eat a little snack. There's no helping it.

I eat salad for lunch three days a week.

Can I eat something delicious for lunch for the remaining 4 days?

If you don't eat twice the calories, then the total calorie intake for the week is reduced, right?

Then you'll lose weight.

I create my own logic like this and convince myself that it's okay to eat.

From a third-party perspective, it's easy to understand why the weight isn't coming off.

However, from the perspective of the party whose thoughts are contaminated,

I am definitely working hard on my diet, and I am clearly eating less.

Why can't I lose weight? This question often comes to mind.

However, there are people who eat very little but still don't lose weight, right?

Yes, there are people like that.

In such cases, the metabolic rate of other substances decreases to maintain balance.

It is often said that following a low-calorie diet can lower your basal metabolic rate.

However, the metabolic rate during activity decreases before the basal metabolic rate.

Even though I eat little, I don't lose weight. Instead, I gain weight. When I see people like this...

In schools and companies, people are always sitting down, and even when they have free time, they don't tend to move around much.

When I finish school or come home from work, I often find myself lying in bed and not wanting to get up.

If the level of physical activity decreases so drastically and the basal metabolic rate also drops,

Even if you eat less, you won't lose weight.

So what should I do?

Eating delivery food and suddenly eating a salad.

Suddenly doing a lot of exercise after not exercising at all usually.

Rather than doing it this way, it's better to change it gradually.

For example, in the case of the person sharing their story,

Instead of suddenly eating a salad for lunch,

It is better to eat delivery food as it is, but to reduce the amount you eat.

I know that even a single serving of delivery food is quite a lot.

I recruited a colleague from work.

Order a single serving or order 1.5 servings by adding a side menu to a single serving.

There is a way to share it between the two of us.

But usually I eat a full serving, so wouldn't it be insufficient if I only eat half?

Yes, that's right.

You can prepare vegetables like leafy greens or salad and eat them together.

From the beginning, a single serving of delivery food was enough to make me obese due to its large portion size.

Just because it is reduced by half does not mean it becomes an insufficient amount.

However, there is a volume of the food I usually eat.

If you reduce the amount you eat and the volume decreases, it may lead to lower satisfaction.

It is about filling that insufficient volume with vegetables.

And the dietary fiber in vegetables has the effect of preventing blood sugar from rising.

It also helps to lower the increased appetite from delivery food.

In this case, appetite will return to normal.

The amount of dinner eaten at home will also decrease.

You can lose weight without necessarily eating less or starving yourself; your overall food intake can decrease naturally.

Rather than doing high-intensity exercise twice a week,

Even if you lower the intensity a bit, doing it frequently can help with your diet.

For example, even if you don't exercise separately,

Even just walking for 10 minutes after a meal can help with dieting.

Of course, it is necessary to engage in high-intensity exercise for muscle growth, but

It's difficult for someone who is not used to exercising to do it that way right away.

You can start with light exercise and gradually increase the intensity.

So to summarize,

I have decided to go on a diet and suddenly change all my lifestyle patterns starting today.

This is almost impossible.

There are some people who can do it, but most fail.

So, I will maintain the overall structure of my lifestyle.

You gradually improve little by little from there.

By making those changes, in the end, you will be able to live in a much healthier state compared to how you were at the beginning.

Then, just by maintaining that state, you will continue to lose weight.

So, instead of trying to make a big change all at once, it's better to make small changes gradually.

No matter how hard I try, the diet won't be over overnight.

No matter what I do, it will inevitably take a long time.

So, it is better to do it in a way that doesn't cause problems, even if it takes a long time.

The dietary fiber in vegetables helps prevent blood sugar spikes, which is beneficial for dieting.

Even if you eat delivery food for lunch,

You mentioned that reducing portions and eating vegetables can help with dieting.

Can you achieve the same effects by consuming a powder high in dietary fiber, like psyllium husk powder, instead of vegetables?

No, that's not the case.

Vegetables and psyllium husk powder are distinctly different.

I previously made a response video for the same question.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure a video about psyllium husk powder appears in the top left.

How vegetables can help in situations where processed foods like delivery meals are consumed.

What is the difference between psyllium husk powder and vegetables?

If you are curious about this, you can click to see it.

You mentioned that even just walking for 10 minutes after a meal can help with dieting.

How can just 10 minutes of light activity, like walking, help with dieting?

In fact, there is an experiment that showed walking for 10 minutes after each meal, three times a day for a total of 30 minutes, resulted in a weight loss of 3 kg in a month.

There was a question about this experiment in the past, so I made a related video.

I will have a video about walking after meals displayed in the upper right.

If you're curious, you can click to see it.

In the story earlier, there was a question about whether the reason for gaining weight was due to age.

Please tell me a bit about age-related weight gain.

I previously talked in detail about age-related weight gain in a series of videos.

I will make sure to have a video about age-related changes appear in the bottom left.

If you are curious about age-related weight gain, you can click here to see more.

It's really scary how appetite can corrupt reason and make us eat more.

So, what I think is an appropriate amount of food could actually be a lot.

Is there a way to find out the right portion size for me?

There is.

In the satiety series I created before, I talked about that part.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right.
