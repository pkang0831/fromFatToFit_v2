Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video about beauty weight.

The playlist link is displayed in the top right corner of the previous video.

If you want to watch the video in front, you can click to see it.

Since the content of the video is connected, it is advisable to watch it if possible.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about how to achieve a beauty weight without starving or following a low-calorie diet.

In this video, I will talk about how I built muscle through exercise.

I will talk about becoming too thick.

In the case of women, they prefer a slim figure.

When I heard the advice to build muscle through exercise.

I worry that my muscles will develop too much and I won't have a slim figure, but rather a bulky body.

When I talk about these worries, I always get the same response.

To build muscle, male hormones are necessary.

In the case of women, a lack of male hormones makes it difficult for muscles to develop easily.

So no matter how hard an average person works out, they won't develop a muscular physique.

Feeling like your body is getting thicker is a temporary phenomenon, so there's no need to worry.

However, even after discussing this, the woman's worries and anxieties do not disappear.

There are many women who do not exercise because they are afraid of getting bulky.

Because it is not a temporary phenomenon, but rather an experience of actually becoming thicker.

What process do you go through... When you first start exercising and a few days have passed?

You will experience the areas you exercise becoming thicker and firmer.

The cause at this time is indeed the phenomenon of blood and water pooling, which temporarily thickens.

So, take a break from exercise for about a week or so.

If you continue to exercise consistently without rest, over time you will return to your original state.

So during this time, rather than giving up on exercise due to worry and anxiety, it is a time to find reassurance.

Women don't easily build muscle.

I heard that even if it becomes thicker or harder, it's just a temporary accumulation of moisture.

It was actually a temporary phenomenon.

So during this time, it's rare for people to give up on exercising.

If you continue to exercise over time, the phenomenon of becoming thicker will occur again.

And at this time, the thickening is not a temporary phenomenon.

If it is a temporary phenomenon, it should occur at the beginning of the exercise or return to normal when the exercise is stopped.

The duration of my exercise has been quite significant, and even if I take a week off, I don't return to my original state.

It's not a temporary phenomenon, so as worries and anxieties accumulate...

Could it be that I have a body type that easily gains muscle, even though I am a woman?

Even if muscles don't grow as large as a man's, could it be that I won't end up with a beautiful body?

I start to have such worries.

In this situation, saying "It's a temporary phenomenon" or "Women don't easily build muscle" is pointless.

Most people give up on exercising because they don't believe in it.

This is a typical reason why women avoid exercising.

It is true that women have a harder time developing muscles due to a lack of male hormones.

Why does the phenomenon of actually becoming thicker occur?

As mentioned in the subcutaneous fat video series,

In the case of men, body fat tends to accumulate primarily as visceral fat.

In the case of women, body fat tends to accumulate primarily as subcutaneous fat.

Because of this, there are physical differences between male and female obesity.

Visceral fat is the fat that is located inside the body, attached to the organs rather than on the outside like subcutaneous fat.

When the amount of visceral fat increases, it pushes the abdominal muscles covering the organs outward.

You can think of it as putting air, which represents visceral fat, into a balloon called abdominal muscles.

As the abdominal muscles swell, the belly covering them also bulges out.

So, a man's obesity causes his belly to swell up like a balloon.

It's a situation that's inflated like a balloon, so when you touch it, it feels firm and doesn't easily compress even when pressed.

It is the same concept as this.

Subcutaneous fat is the fat that is located on the outside, covering the muscles.

So when the muscles develop and grow, the subcutaneous fat on the outside gets pushed up.

You can think of it as putting air, which represents muscle, into a balloon that represents subcutaneous fat.

So it swells up like the belly of an obese man, and even when pressed, it doesn't go in and feels firm.

They say that when muscle mass increases, subcutaneous fat decreases.

As mentioned in the series of videos on subcutaneous fat,

Muscles and subcutaneous fat have overlapping functions.

When muscle mass decreases, subcutaneous fat increases to take over the work of the muscles.

When muscle mass increases, the amount of subcutaneous fat decreases.

This is not happening simultaneously.

Muscle increases and takes over the role of subcutaneous fat.

Then, when the body no longer needs fat, it will be lost.

So it's not that the muscle increases and the subcutaneous fat decreases, making it thinner.

Muscles grow thicker, and then as subcutaneous fat decreases, the body becomes slimmer.

In the end, it becomes thick and then thin again.

But why do so many men say that women don't get thick at all?

The man does not have much body fat, which is why he has not had such experiences.

So, if muscle mass increases in a situation with a lot of body fat,

The outer subcutaneous fat is pushed up, becoming inflated like a balloon, firm, and thicker.

In the first place, a person without body fat doesn't have any fat for the muscles to push up.

So I don't have that experience.

The man has a low amount of body fat, and because of that, he hasn't experienced it himself.

It means that it doesn't get thicker.

And among women,

There are people who are thin with low muscle and subcutaneous fat, you know, those who are underweight.

When these individuals increased their muscle mass through exercise,

I have not experienced becoming thicker like a woman with a lot of subcutaneous fat.

So these people are women, but they are just like men.

It doesn't get thicker. It's a temporary phenomenon. This is often what is said.

I will summarize.

To reduce body fat, you need to increase muscle mass through exercise.

As muscle mass increases, it does not simultaneously mean that subcutaneous fat decreases.

The subcutaneous fat remains the same, and first, the muscle mass will increase from here.

At this time, a phenomenon occurs where the body becomes thicker and bulkier.

After this, if the muscles take over the role of subcutaneous fat and subcutaneous fat becomes unnecessary,

Finally, as the body fat decreases, I become thinner and slimmer again.

So if you are a woman who is exercising and your body has become thicker, bulkier, and firmer, then...

Finally, the conditions have been created for body fat to be lost.

Don't give up here; if you keep exercising consistently for just a little longer,

You can achieve a slim body.

However, even if you understand the content up to this point,

There are cases where there is a reluctance to accept a higher actual weight.

Still, I think I would like to try to lose weight down to the 40kg range at least once.

If a woman's weight exceeds 50 kg, it is often considered that she is not slim.

In the next video, we will discuss misconceptions about a weight of 40kg.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the third part of the beauty weight series,

I am still in the process of making the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

If you found the video helpful, please subscribe and like it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
