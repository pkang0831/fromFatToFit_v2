Hello, this is pkang.

A question about lower body obesity was posted in the comments.

In this video, I will talk about lower body obesity.

To talk about lower body obesity, we first need to discuss muscle weight.

Weight muscle refers to the muscles that have developed due to body weight.

For example, a person weighing 60 kg with no prior exercise experience

If I try to squat with a 40kg barbell, I can't stand up because the barbell is too heavy.

However, if this person gains weight and reaches 100kg,

Is this person unable to stand up once they sit down? Of course not.

Even if you weigh 100kg, it is possible to stand up, walk, climb stairs, and even run.

So, when I weighed 60kg, I couldn't handle the additional 40kg, making a total weight of 100kg.

When you reach a weight of 100kg, it means you will be able to withstand a weight of 100kg.

Why is this happening?

When you place a strong load on your muscles and use them frequently, they develop, grow, and become stronger.

When weight increases, the process of moving a heavier body becomes...

When a strong load is placed on the muscles and they are used frequently, they gradually grow and become stronger.

In fact, in cases of severe obesity, it is common for individuals with no exercise experience to show high muscle mass in body composition tests.

It is because my body is heavy and my muscle mass has developed.

However, if you undergo an InBody test without knowing this information,

Even though I have no experience with exercise, my muscle mass comes out high on the InBody test.

They say it's really hard for women to build muscle, but I haven't exercised at all and I have a lot of muscle mass.

Am I someone who easily builds muscle? I often think about this.

If you don't know about muscle mass, it's not strange to think this way.

However, regardless of whether they are male or female, anyone who gains weight will develop muscle mass.

It is natural for someone who is overweight to have a lot of muscle mass.

Of course, it's not a body type that easily builds muscle.

The muscle that develops due to weight is called weight muscle.

Chest muscles to support sagging belly fat.

The back muscles that help prevent the body from falling forward.

Arm muscles, etc., to support the weight of the arm.

All the muscles in the body develop, but among them, the muscles in the lower body develop the most.

The well-developed weight muscles in the lower body are one of the causes of lower body obesity.

As mentioned in the second part of the beauty weight video,

Subcutaneous fat is located just beneath the skin and covers the muscles.

When there is a lot of subcutaneous fat, if the muscles underneath develop, then...

The muscles push up the subcutaneous fat on the outside, making that area become very thick.

When the lower body muscles, which have developed significantly as weight muscles, push up the subcutaneous fat in the lower body,

Of course, the lower body becomes very thick, leading to concerns about lower body obesity.

They say that when you build muscle, body fat decreases, right?

If the muscle mass in the lower body increases, shouldn't the subcutaneous fat in the lower body decrease?

Subcutaneous fat serves as a shield that protects the body from external impacts.

It serves the role of clothing that keeps the body warm so that body heat does not escape to the outside.

Muscles generate heat when they are used.

If there is a lot of muscle and also a lot of subcutaneous fat, there is a problem of the body temperature becoming too high.

So, it was said that when muscle mass increases, the amount of subcutaneous fat decreases.

The important part here is that heat is generated by using muscles.

This heat is causing an increase in body temperature.

We need to release this heat from the body because it shouldn't get too high.

However, the subcutaneous fat is blocking this.

From the body's perspective, subcutaneous fat is a hindrance, which leads to a response to reduce subcutaneous fat.

So, heat is generated inside the body by using muscles. This part is important.

This content was also mentioned in the subcutaneous fat video, but there seems to be a bit of misunderstanding.

Does being in a sauna or wearing a lot of clothes and living in a hot environment help reduce body fat?

I get asked this a lot.

It's not enough to just warm the outside of the body; the part where heat is generated inside the body is important.

In other words,

Even if you have a lot of muscle, if you don't use it, heat won't be generated in the muscles.

If there is no heat generated, it means there is no need to reduce body fat.

In the case of severe obesity with a high body weight

Because my body feels heavy, it requires a lot of energy to move.

Our bodies have a survival instinct to reduce energy consumption.

The heavier the body feels, the less likely it is to want to move.

This reaction of the body manifests in the form of annoyance.

It is often said that people gain weight because they eat and don't move.

In reality, it's not that you gain weight because you eat and don't move.

When you gain weight, you tend to avoid moving.

A person who was active when they were slim tends to avoid moving when they become obese.

A person who used to avoid moving when they were obese

It is very common to see cases where people succeed in dieting and become more active.

Returning to the original story, in the case of obesity, people tend not to move their bodies well.

Even if you have a lot of muscle, heat doesn't generate well from the muscles, so the subcutaneous fat doesn't decrease.

In this situation, if I happen to move my body even once, a lot of heat is generated because I have a lot of muscle mass.

The symptoms of feeling very hot occur because a lot of subcutaneous fat prevents heat from escaping.

What should I do to solve lower body obesity?

Heavy weights are the cause of developing muscle mass.

You can lose weight with an unprocessed food diet.

When weight increases, muscle mass develops, but...

On the contrary, when weight decreases, muscle mass gradually decreases as well.

What is unrefined food?

Processed food is called refined food, while unprocessed food is referred to as unrefined food.

For example, processed meats like ham, sausage, and patties, which are made by grinding or chopping meat, are considered refined foods.

Eating raw meat after purchasing it falls under the category of unrefined food.

I previously made a detailed video on how to distinguish unrefined foods.

The video link is displayed in the upper right corner, so if you're curious, you can click on it to watch.

Is it that I shouldn't exercise because my muscles are so developed that I've become bottom-heavy?

That's not the case.

The cause of lower body obesity is not just having weight and muscle alone.

There are indeed people who have normal weight but still experience lower body obesity due to other causes.

In the next video, I will talk about people who have a normal weight but are experiencing lower body obesity.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure to display the video on the right.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the lower body obesity video, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
