Reasons why you may not lose weight even with high-calorie-burning exercises.

Hello, this is pkang.

Among the videos I made in the past,

There is a video that says, "The reduction of body fat is not due to the calories burned through exercise."

If you consistently burn calories through regular exercise,

The body has a response that prepares the calories needed for exercise in advance.

Even if you do exercises that burn a lot of calories, it doesn't mean that body fat will decrease as quickly.

In my eagerness to lose weight quickly, I challenged myself with high-calorie-burning exercises, but...

It's really tough and difficult, so please don't give up easily.

It is good for me to do exercises at a slightly challenging intensity that I can consistently maintain.

This was the content of the video.

In the comments of this video

Where do the calories that the body prepares come from?

If you exercise and eat a lot because you're hungry, it's obvious that you won't lose weight.

If you exercise and endure hunger, isn't it true that the calories burned from the exercise will lead to fat loss?

Many questions like this have been raised.

In this video, I will talk about how the body prepares for the calories burned during exercise.

Burn calories through exercise to reduce body fat.

This story is based on the calorie diet theory.

It is a theory that obesity and dieting are determined by the amount of calories consumed and the amount of calories burned.

If the calories consumed from food are greater than the calories the body uses,

Excess calories accumulate as body fat, leading to obesity.

Conversely, if the calories consumed by the body are greater than the calories obtained from food,

This means that dieting occurs because the body uses stored fat to make up for the insufficient calories.

So, if you consume a lot of calories through exercise and increase the calories your body burns,

The calories consumed by the body exceed the calories obtained from food.

The diet works by using body fat to make up for the insufficient calories.

When you burn calories through exercise, body fat decreases.

The idea has developed that doing exercises that burn a lot of calories leads to a greater reduction in body fat.

However, there is a significant flaw in the calorie diet theory that underpins this story.

The story based on the calorie diet theory includes not only exercise but also aspects related to diet.

If we talk about the diet, we can clearly identify the errors.

By reducing the amount of food you eat or by consuming low-calorie foods.

If the calories consumed from food are lower than the calories the body expends, then...

It will lead to weight loss because the body will use body fat to make up for the insufficient calories.

So you need to eat less food or consume low-calorie foods.

This is a low-calorie diet based on the calorie diet theory.

When this diet was first introduced, it was considered the truth of dieting.

It has now become a symbol of unhealthy dieting methods.

Because in the calorie diet theory,

Even if you lower your calorie intake with a low-calorie diet,

The calories consumed by the body will not change. I had been assuming this.

This is not actually the case.

To explain it in an easy-to-understand way using numbers,

If you consume food worth 50 while your body is using 100 energy, then...

I thought that since there was a shortfall of 50, the body fat would decrease by that amount.

In reality, after eating 50 units of food, the energy my body consumes decreased to 50.

If you follow a low-calorie diet, your basal metabolic rate decreases, making it easier to gain weight.

When the body originally consumed 100.

Even if I eat 100 units of food, I don't gain weight, and if I reduce my food intake to 50 units, I lose weight.

When your body changes to consume 50, even if you reduce your food intake by 50, you won't lose weight.

If you eat the same amount of food you used to eat, which is 100, you might actually end up gaining weight.

So, if you lower your calorie intake to create a calorie deficit in your body,

I thought that since I was lacking calories, my body fat would continue to decrease.

The truth is that the body adapts to a situation of calorie deficiency.

This means that a reaction occurs that lowers the body's metabolic rate.

Then, when you increase calorie expenditure through exercise and create a calorie deficit in your body,

Will our bodies continue to lose body fat without any response, as long as we consume fewer calories than needed?

Or to adapt to a situation where there is a lack of calories.

Will there be a reaction to prepare the calories needed for exercise?

Naturally, a response to prepare calories occurs.

So, how does the body prepare the calories needed for exercise?

There are three main methods.

The first method is an increase in appetite.

You are trying to replenish the energy expended through exercise with food.

When you actually exercise, you feel hungry, and it's something everyone can experience that your appetite becomes very strong.

Athletes with high levels of physical activity consume significantly more food than the average person.

If you eat whatever you want just because you're hungry from exercising, isn't it obvious that you won't lose weight?

Even if I want to eat, I have to hold back.

If you resist your appetite and don't eat more, the absorption rate will increase as a second method.

When we usually talk about the calories in food,

Let's assume that 100% of the calories from the food consumed are absorbed by the body.

If you eat food that contains 500 calories, let's assume that 500 calories have entered your body.

However, a person is not able to absorb 100% of the food they eat.

When a person eats food and the digestion and absorption are complete, it is excreted as feces.

This manure can be used as fertilizer for plants.

In the case of white rice and brown rice, there is almost no difference in calories.

The white rice is what you get after removing the husk from the brown rice, so that's only natural.

If a person who eats white rice switches to brown rice, it can have a weight loss effect.

If the calories from the food we eat are absorbed 100% by the body,

There are no remaining calories in the feces after digestion and absorption are complete.

It should not be effective even when given to plants as fertilizer.

Whether you eat brown rice or white rice, since you are consuming the same calories, there shouldn't be any difference.

In reality, the calories that we do not absorb remain in the feces.

When you use manure as fertilizer for plants, it has the effect of promoting their growth.

Brown rice is harder to digest and absorb than white rice, which is why there are many calories that are not absorbed.

When a person who eats white rice switches to brown rice, it can have a weight loss effect.

So, it means that a person can only absorb a portion of the calories they consume.

The degree to which this is absorbed is called the absorption rate.

This absorption rate is not fixed.

Like brown rice and white rice, it is affected by the state of the food.

Or it is affected by the amount of food consumed.

When the amount of food consumed increases, the absorption rate decreases, so it's important to prevent excessive calorie intake.

When the amount of food consumed decreases, the absorption rate increases to ensure that calories are not insufficient.

It is a reaction that arises from homeostasis, which seeks to maintain the current state.

The reason for the yo-yo effect when following a low-calorie diet is not only due to a decrease in metabolic rate, but also...

This is also because the absorption rate increases, allowing more calories to be absorbed from the same food.

If the calories burned through exercise have increased, but the amount of food consumed has not increased, then...

This increase in absorption rate makes you want to replenish the calories needed for exercise.

So even if you maintain the same amount of food intake, despite the increased appetite from exercising,

The calories burned through exercise are replenished.

If your appetite increases and your absorption rate improves, but you still lack the calories needed for exercise,

The third method will reduce the metabolic rate.

When talking about a decrease in metabolic rate, many people think of basal metabolic rate.

The energy a person consumes in a day is not just based on their basal metabolic rate.

There are three things: basal, activity, and exercise metabolic rate.

Basal metabolic rate refers to the energy used by internal organs such as the brain, heart, lungs, and liver, as well as for maintaining body temperature.

The active metabolic rate refers to the energy used during everyday activities.

Exercise metabolic rate refers to the energy used during exercise.

Since I eat very little food, even if I increase the absorption rate, I won't be able to replenish the calories needed for exercise.

By reducing other metabolic rates, energy is conserved and used for exercise.

The level of activity has drastically decreased, so I need to conserve my metabolic rate.

When the basal metabolic rate decreases, the body feels weak and tends to feel sleepy a lot.

In the case of people who are on a low-calorie diet and also exercise,

Feeling weak and tired, I either sleep a lot or...

Aside from the time spent exercising, I often just want to lie still.

The basal metabolic rate and activity metabolic rate have decreased, so you are securing the calories needed for exercise.

I will summarize.

When you burn calories through exercise and your body enters a calorie deficit situation,

The body adapts to the situation by increasing appetite to eat more food or

Increase the absorption rate to secure as many calories as possible from a small amount of food.

I am trying to reduce my caloric intake to secure the calories needed for exercise.

From a human perspective, exercise is an action aimed at reducing body fat, but

From the body's perspective, it is similar to the hunting that ancient humans used to do.

In a situation where food is scarce, hunting must be done even if it means giving up something else.

I am determined to ensure that I secure this amount of exercise metabolism, no matter what.

Therefore, the calories burned through exercise do not have a direct impact on fat loss.

You don't have to force yourself to do high-calorie-burning exercises just because you want to lose weight quickly.

The best exercise for me is one that I can consistently continue and that has a slightly challenging intensity for my body.

However, if exercising to burn calories does not lead to a reduction in body fat,

Isn't it unnecessary to exercise in the first place?

The body fat accumulated in a person's body is divided into two types: visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

The body fat that supplies energy to the body is visceral fat.

The body fat mentioned in the video so far is about visceral fat.

So even if you burn calories through exercise, it doesn't mean that visceral fat will decrease.

If you want to reduce visceral fat, focusing on your diet is much more effective than exercising.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is not fat that is used for energy, so it is difficult to lose through diet.

If you want to reduce body fat, you need to exercise to build muscle and increase your activity level.

Exercise does not have the effect of reducing visceral fat, but...

It is necessary to exercise because it is effective in reducing subcutaneous fat.

I recently covered this in detail in a video about spot reduction for weight loss that I made.
