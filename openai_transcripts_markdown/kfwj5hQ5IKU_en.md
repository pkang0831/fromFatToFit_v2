The topic of this video is about why people are becoming increasingly selfish.

Recently, posts that are appearing on the internet or

As I watch various incidents and accidents reported in the news,

I often feel that people are very selfish.

Even in the case of writing for the internet,

It's hard to believe that such a person could exist.

Acting solely for one's own benefit without consideration for others.

There are many people who do not adhere to moral norms or socially accepted manners.

In cases of incidents and accidents, it may not escalate to such a significant issue.

It's a problem that can be resolved through conversation.

Seeing incidents that are resolved with strong violence

I haven't aged that much, but...

When I was young, it seems like people weren't this selfish.

I can't help but think that the world has become quite selfish.

What makes a person selfish?

I've thought about what the problem might be.

There is also an argument that people have not become selfish.

In the past, people were just as selfish.

The same incidents and accidents were still there.

At that time, there was no internet or smartphones.

If you are not directly involved in that matter, you wouldn't have had the opportunity to access that information.

Because we now have the internet and smartphones,

Even if you are not directly related to the incident.

Through real-time search terms and the ability to share on social media.

Even if I don't want that information, it gets shoved in front of me.

That's why such incidents are often seen and feel numerous.

There is also the argument that people haven't become selfish, and that's not the reason why such things happen frequently.

Logically, this makes perfect sense as well.

But if you just say that the world has always been this way, then...

There isn't anything we need to worry about there, right?

So let's leave that part as it is.

If there is any factor that has made people even a little selfish,

Think about that element.

In order not to become selfish.

I started to think about how it might be a good idea to be cautious about that aspect.

While pondering this, I came across a stand-up comedian from the U.S. named CK Lewis on YouTube.

This person appeared on a talk show and gave an interview.

In that interview, I gained some insights into why people become selfish.

So, what was CK Lewis's interview about?

CK Lewis has children.

Luis says he absolutely does not give his children smartphones.

If you have listened to the story up to this point,

For those of you watching the video who are younger,

I have a smartphone, but my parents are trying to take it away from me again.

For those who want a smartphone but their parents won't buy one for them.

You might express a contrary opinion by asking, "What are you talking about?"

When I took the smartphone away from the children, it wasn't because I thought we shouldn't give them smartphones.

I believe that children also need smartphones.

Because it is an environment that cannot be lived without.

Because of that, a conversation network is established.

Without a smartphone, it becomes impossible to even join that conversation.

Since it's an era where every class has a group chat.

If you don't have a smartphone, you can't participate in the group chat.

Then you can't fit in with the group, right?

It's not that I'm trying to take away your smartphone.

The discussion about the problems that arise when Luis gives a smartphone to a child is quite persuasive.

It means that you agreed that there could be problems arising from that.

It means to be cautious about such issues, even though we use smartphones.

So what problem is there?

When a person is having a conversation while looking at someone's face,

It's not just about gaining information from what that person is saying.

We have conversations by seeing with our eyes and hearing with our ears.

By looking with my eyes, I observe what kind of expression that person is making and what gestures they are using.

You can tell whether someone is sad or angry, among other emotions.

You can hear that person's accent or tone of voice.

You can tell whether someone is speaking sarcastically or sincerely.

Through this information, while having a conversation with that person,

When I tell a story, I can unconsciously see how others think and react to it.

It's not something you look at intentionally, but rather something you see naturally.

What is commonly referred to as understanding the atmosphere is like this.

As time has passed, we have moved from an era where people communicated by looking at each other's faces.

It has changed to an era of communication.

Then, if we mainly communicate through calls,

That person's face becomes invisible.

I can only hear sounds. In the conversation.

It's still okay for now.

In a situation where sounds can be heard, one listens to the intonation and tone of voice.

You can see how this person reacts to what I say.

However, as time passed, smartphones emerged.

Messenger apps like KakaoTalk are emerging.

And people start to mainly communicate through messaging apps.

What will happen then?

Even the sounds that could be heard with the ears disappear.

Since we are only communicating through text,

So, the person I am currently having a conversation with is...

No one knows what kind of expression it is.

This is what becomes a problem.

The way it becomes a problem is that...

For example, let's assume there is a chubby young child named A.

Let's assume that Luis's daughter said to this child, "A, you are fat."

So how will A react?

With a red face, expressing anger.

So you might get angry and ask if you contributed anything.

Or you might cry and say, "Why do you talk to me like that?"

In any case, the emotions that a person feels are conveyed through their facial expressions and voice.

Because the child appears to be chubby on the outside, I had such thoughts.

I talked about it, but as a result, my friend got angry or sad.

I also find myself in situations where I get angry or feel sad.

So I have thought about it, and even if my thoughts seem to align with the facts,

When I speak, the other person might dislike it, and as a result, I could face negative consequences.

Before telling the story,

What kind of reaction the other person will show when I tell this story.

You unconsciously learn that you need to think things through.

This is what is commonly referred to as consideration.

However, if it's a conversation over the phone rather than face-to-face.

What will happen if we talk through KakaoTalk messenger instead of a phone call?

I said to someone on KakaoTalk, "Who are you? You're fat."

Then, when that person hears it,

In KakaoTalk, facial expressions cannot be seen.

It's very easy to hide feelings of anger or sadness.

And in most cases, I hide it.

Why? Showing that I reacted strongly to that statement.

It's because I think it's not good.

It seems like you care a lot about that.

I don't want to reveal my complex.

"Huh? Really?" is something that is brushed off as if it’s not a big deal.

From the perspective of the child who told this story,

I expressed what I was thinking to the other person.

I am not receiving any feedback at all.

There is no credible feedback to believe that this is wrong at all.

So, you grow up without realizing that this is wrong.

And when such a person grows,

Later, when I saw someone's face and made a rude comment.

If that person reacts negatively,

Did I say something wrong?

So did I say something that isn't true?

Then it becomes a reaction like, "Well, why don't you lose weight and get slim in advance?"

I don't understand why you are reacting that way.

What I said isn't wrong; it's the truth, it's a fact. So why are you reacting that way?

This is how it goes.

And in this case,

This does not only apply to children who have grown up in this way.

I have grown through a way of communicating by looking at faces, but...

It applies the same way to adults who have started using messenger apps a lot.

When using messenger apps like KakaoTalk,

You just need to focus on the conversation.

You just need to focus on understanding the information being exchanged in the conversation.

If we happen to have a call,

You need to pay attention to the other person's tone and intonation.

You need to pay extra attention to the conversation content here.

And if it is a face-to-face conversation while looking at each other's faces,

You need to pay attention to the other person's facial expressions and gestures.

You need to pay attention to the other person's tone and intonation.

Lastly, you need to pay attention to the content of the conversation as well.

Every time it moves from the left to the right.

The things I need to pay attention to are increasing one by one.

At first, the content

The second is what needs to be heard and its content.

The third is what needs to be seen with the eyes, heard with the ears, and the content.

As this happens, people instinctively...

I tend to prefer the left side over the right.

And actually contacting through KakaoTalk is not very burdensome.

More and more people are finding it difficult to make phone calls.

You may have seen related articles that have become an issue.

And one more interesting thing is that

Among those who say, "It's easier to use KakaoTalk than to make a call; calling is difficult,"

It means that a large number of people in their 20s and 30s are included.

However, people in their 30s now were born in the 1980s and spent their childhood in the 1990s.

These people didn't have smartphones when they were young.

And now, those in their 20s were born in the 1990s and spent their childhood in the 2000s.

These individuals had smartphones when they were young.

At that time, smartphones were still a relatively new invention.

It was a very expensive item.

Office workers use it for work purposes.

Or it was used as a gift for entering college when one became an adult.

It wasn't something that students carried around as a matter of course like they do now.

Then, these people in their 20s and 30s definitely...

Even though we are a generation that grew up having face-to-face conversations while looking at each other's faces,

As I grew up and became accustomed to conversations through messenger apps,

I am gradually forgetting what I learned in face-to-face conversations.

So, they find it difficult to make phone calls and prefer messaging.

As a result, I naturally began to forget about consideration for others.

People are becoming increasingly selfish.

So let's just not give smartphones to young children.

This is not a problem that can be solved by doing that.

Even if I was forced to have face-to-face conversations because I wasn't given a smartphone when I was young,

As you grow and start using messenger apps, the same problems arise again.

So please don't take away smartphones from the children.

In my opinion... we can't just stop using messengers, right?

I can't imagine living without a messenger app in my life right now.

I also use it a lot and really like it because it's convenient.

There is also the advantage of being able to communicate frequently because it is convenient.

So it's not the idea of not using messenger apps.

There is a problem like this.

And because of that, people may gradually become more selfish.

Just thinking about being careful and cautious so that I don't end up that way is enough.

I believe the world will get a little better.

Sounds plausible, right?
