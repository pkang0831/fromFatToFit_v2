Upper Body Fat Loss Exercises for Reducing Arm and Back Fat - Upper Body Obesity Part 3

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the third video about upper body obesity.

In the first video, we talked about the causes of upper body obesity.

What we commonly refer to as arm fat and back fat is the subcutaneous fat on the arms and back.

Subcutaneous fat is difficult to lose through diet alone, so it is said that exercising is an effective way to reduce it.

We talked about what kind of exercise to do in the second video.

I mentioned that you can increase upper body muscle mass through upper body exercises and that you can do knit exercises.

As I explain the concept of knit exercise,

I only talked about examples like the thigh exercise called "book thighs" and the abdominal exercise known as "draw-in exercise."

So the discussion about exercises to lose arm and back fat was left out.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it will be easier to understand if you watch them in order.

The link for this series is available at the top right.

If you haven't watched the previous video, you can click and watch them in order.

First, for back pain, you can do drawing exercises.

The draw-in exercise is a movement that pulls the belly inward.

To pull something, you need a support that can withstand that force.

In the pull-up exercise, the muscles used for support are the back muscles.

It may be misunderstood that only the abdominal muscles are used because you are pulling your stomach in.

In fact, you also use your back muscles along with your abdominal muscles.

In fact, if you maintain the drawing exercise for a long time, you can feel a significant stimulus in your back muscles along with your abdominal muscles.

You can do drawing exercises to reduce back fat.

What should I do about arm fat? Should I exercise my arms often?

If arm exercises refer to exercises done with dumbbells, then that's not the case.

You need to distinguish between exercises that put a load on the muscles and knit exercises.

The purpose of exercises that put a load on the muscles is to increase muscle mass.

The purpose of the knit exercise is to increase activity levels.

So exercises like crunches or leg raises are workouts that increase the muscle mass of the abdominal muscles.

Doing this kind of exercise does not mean that belly fat will be lost.

On the other hand, knit exercises like the draw-in movement are effective for reducing belly fat, but they do not significantly increase muscle mass.

In the same concept, arm exercises are effective for increasing muscle mass in the arms, but they do not help in reducing arm fat.

However, to do the drawing exercise, you first need to build your abdominal muscles with crunches or leg raises, right?

If you don't have strength in your abdominal muscles, you won't be able to do drawing exercises.

Similarly, you need to build the muscles in your arms through arm exercises in order to be able to do knit exercises, right?

In principle, that's true.

In the case of the arms, you don't need to do separate exercises; the necessary muscles will develop naturally as you engage in other workouts.

Upper body exercises can be broadly divided into chest exercises and back exercises.

Both of these exercises involve using the arms during the workout process.

So when you do chest and back exercises, the muscles in your arms also tend to grow to some extent.

This amount of muscle is sufficient for the purpose of reducing subcutaneous fat in the arms.

There is no need to specifically do arm exercises.

So, what should I do for arm exercises with knitting?

There isn't a specific knit exercise for the arms. The arms are a body part that we use very frequently.

If I use my arms frequently and don't need to do knit exercises, why do I still gain fat on my arms?

It's because of the posture.

These days, there is no one who doesn't use a smartphone.

When using a smartphone, it naturally causes the head to lean forward.

When the head is tilted forward, the body's balance is disrupted.

To maintain balance, the lower part needs to go in the opposite direction.

So when the head tilts forward, the chest and back lean back to maintain balance.

When the chest and back lean back, the lower abdomen protrudes forward.

When the lower abdomen protrudes forward, the hips move back.

When the buttocks move back, it causes tension in the thighs.

This is what is commonly referred to as a "turtle neck" posture.

When you have this turtle neck posture, your arms come forward and stick to your body.

Because when the chest and back are pulled back, the shoulders tend to roll forward.

When the shoulders roll forward, the arms tend to stick closer to the body.

In this case, my arms and chest keep brushing against each other.

This fleeting sensation is very uncomfortable, so I feel a reluctance to raise my arms.

So, not using the arms well or

Even when using the arms, the armpit and forearm areas remain pressed against the body, using only the lower part of the arm.

This is one of the causes of arm fat increase.

Because the turtle neck posture is a problem.

By building muscle through chest exercises, back exercises, and lower body exercises, improve your posture.

To improve the habit of not stretching your arms, you can consciously use your entire arms.

So, when the arm position is correct, the usage of the arms increases, leading to the effects of knit exercise.

I found information related to upper body obesity, and it mentioned that poor fluid circulation can lead to fat accumulation in the back and arms.

How do we solve this?

When there is a problem with fluid circulation, edema occurs as body fluids accumulate in certain areas.

Due to this swelling, it is possible for the fat on the arms or back to be more noticeable.

However, the cause of the problem with poor fluid circulation is the same.

You have poor posture, insufficient muscle mass, and a lack of physical activity.

So, after increasing muscle mass through exercise and correcting my posture,

If you increase your activity level through NEAT exercise, it will help resolve issues along the way.

Based on the information so far, if you exercise properly, most upper body obesity can be resolved.

If there is an issue with your diet, you may continue to have upper body obesity even if you exercise hard.

In the next video, let's talk about upper body obesity and diet.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure the next video appears on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not about upper body obesity, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making it.
