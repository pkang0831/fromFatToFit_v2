All videos have subtitles.

This is the fifth video about the water diet.

The first video is about cold water.

The second video discusses the feeling of fullness from water.

In the third video, it discusses warm water.

In the fourth video, we talked about how to drink water.

If you have watched the previous videos thoroughly,

Drinking water helps with dieting. You must have understood this.

Some people find it difficult to just drink water.

So I've been asked a lot whether it's okay to drink coffee or tea.

In this video, I would like to talk about how to drink water comfortably.

There is a lot of talk about drinking water for dieting and health.

It is said that during this time, drinking water is fine, but coffee or tea is not allowed.

Why do they say it can't be done?

Coffee has a diuretic effect, which makes you need to go to the bathroom.

They say that you lose more water from drinking coffee than you gain, so you shouldn't drink it, right?

Yes, there is such a story.

However, when you drink coffee, the amount of water you lose is not greater than the amount of water you gain from it.

You need to drink water for dieting and health.

The reason I am saying this is that there are many people who do not drink water.

On the contrary, you shouldn't drink too much coffee.

The reason I am saying this is that there are many people who drink coffee.

In severe cases, there are people who drink only 4 or 5 cups of coffee a day without even having a glass of water.

If the amount of water lost is greater than the amount of water gained when drinking coffee,

People who live like this continue to lose moisture.

If you maintain this lifestyle for a long time, you will likely experience serious dehydration symptoms.

However, if you actually live like that for several months, it becomes a long-term situation.

There are not many people with severe dehydration symptoms.

The caffeine in coffee has a diuretic effect, which is well-known.

When you drink coffee, the amount of water you lose is not greater than the amount of water you gain.

Can I drink coffee instead of water?

No, that's not the case.

The caffeine in coffee can make you need to go to the bathroom, but it also has a stimulating effect.

The awakening effect temporarily increases concentration and physical abilities.

This is similar to the fight-or-flight response to stress.

When you actually drink coffee,

The hormone known as cortisol, often referred to as the stress hormone, is secreted in increased amounts.

So every time we drink coffee,

Our bodies find themselves in situations similar to experiencing stress.

If you often drink coffee instead of water,

It means being exposed to stress very frequently, which leads to phenomena similar to chronic stress.

As mentioned in the stress series,

Occasional stress can enhance physical abilities and help in solving problems, but

Chronic stress that we experience continuously is not good for our health and makes us gain weight.

So it's okay to drink 1 to 2 cups a day as a treat.

Drinking coffee instead of water is not good.

It's really hard to just drink water. So what should I do?

One way is to drink lemon water with small pieces of lemon added.

There is also a way to brew the tea very lightly.

I've heard that drinking lemon water helps with weight loss and is good for health. Is this true?

No, that's not the case.

Lemon water is originally made only with water and lemon.

The benefits of lemon water refer to the effects of water and lemon.

Since water is something we drink anyway, let's exclude its benefits.

If we only consider the benefits of lemon,

Drinking lemon water does not guarantee that you will receive the benefits of lemons.

The reason is very simple: the amount of lemon used is too small.

Then wouldn't it be enough to just add more lemon?

You need to clarify your purpose.

If you want to benefit from lemons, you can just eat the lemon instead of drinking lemon water.

The purpose of us drinking lemon water is

I want to drink water, but it's hard to just drink plain water.

I added lemon to make it easier to drink that water.

If it has become easier to drink, then the role of the lemon ends here.

If you forcefully try to obtain the benefits of lemon by adding a lot of it,

The water has become very sour, making it difficult to drink.

If you eat lemons too often or in large quantities, it can lead to other side effects.

The reason I recommend lemon water is

The amount of lemon used is so small that it has no effect at all.

Since it has no effects, there are also no side effects.

It's just about drinking water comfortably.

The same goes for cars.

There are various types of cars in the world, but not all of them have been tested.

So it's hard to explain all the benefits of drinking tea.

However, to obtain the benefits, you need to brew the tea strong and drink it frequently.

In this case, you may achieve the benefits, but there is also a risk of side effects.

When we drink coffee, we can wake up and experience improved concentration.

If you continue to drink coffee, it's the same as experiencing side effects.

If you want to drink water comfortably, you might want to take a car.

It is best to dilute it as much as possible, like lemon water, so that it has no effects at all.

Again, the goal is to make it easy to drink water.
