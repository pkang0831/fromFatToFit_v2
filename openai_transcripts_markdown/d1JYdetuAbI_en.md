Is cardio exercise necessary for dieting?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

In the past, I used to exercise for 3 to 4 hours a day, but I received a message saying that I wasn't losing weight.

I made a video explaining why that phenomenon occurs.

To summarize the content of that video briefly,

Exercise that can be done for 3 to 4 hours a day is of a lower intensity.

Exercising at such a low intensity for an extended period of time is

When the goal of exercise is calorie burning, this is the method that is mainly chosen.

Exercises like this have a very low effect on weight loss.

The goal of exercise should be focused on muscle growth, and the intensity of the workout should be increased.

It can be organized like this.

Even if the intensity of the exercise is low and the calories burned are few,

If you exercise for a long time, the total calories burned will be high.

Why does doing low-intensity exercise for a long time not have a weight loss effect?

And what is the reason that burning calories shouldn't be the purpose of exercising?

I talked about the reason in that video.

At the end of the video, I'll make sure to include the link to that video.

For those who are curious about the details, you can click to see them.

Returning to the original story.

After watching that video, the question arose: Does aerobic exercise have no effect on weight loss?

Cardio exercise is done to burn calories, while anaerobic exercise is necessary for muscle growth.

Because of this perception

If the purpose of exercise in a diet is to promote muscle growth, then I was asking whether cardio exercise is necessary.

To put it simply, that's not the case.

The growth of muscles is determined not by the type of exercise, but by the load caused by the exercise.

Running is the most representative form of aerobic exercise.

In that case, won't running increase muscle mass?

That's not the case.

Depending on my body's condition, my muscle mass can increase through running.

Even under the right conditions, you can increase muscle mass just by walking.

A typical example is the muscle of severe obesity.

A light object can be moved with a small force, but

To move a heavy object, a large amount of force is needed, and

To exert great strength, more muscles are needed.

So, individuals with severe obesity develop muscles to move their heavy bodies.

I haven't done any exercise at all, let alone anaerobic exercise.

It is simply because of the strain caused by the heavy body that muscle mass increases through everyday activities.

In reality, when measuring body composition with InBody for individuals with severe obesity,

I have no experience with exercise and I like to lie down, so I have low activity levels.

You have a considerable amount of muscle mass.

So, just because it's cardio exercise doesn't mean that muscle growth doesn't happen.

Regardless of the type of exercise, as long as the load applied to the body is sufficient, muscle mass will increase.

However, I've heard that doing cardio can lead to muscle loss on the internet.

Regardless of the type of exercise, if the load on the body is sufficient, muscle mass will increase.

If we say this in reverse,

This means that if the load on the body decreases in any exercise, muscle loss can occur.

For example, a person who squats with a 100kg barbell is

It will increase muscle mass according to the 100kg barbell.

If this person lowers the weight to 30kg for squats, there may be muscle loss.

I did squats, but I experienced muscle loss.

Is squatting an exercise that causes muscle loss?

Of course, that's not the case.

It's not because I did squats that I experienced muscle loss.

By reducing the barbell weight from 100kg to 30kg, the load on the body has decreased.

The loss of muscle occurred because the load on the body has decreased.

In the same concept, the load that is usually placed on the body through exercise is

When the load on the body is higher than when running,

It is said that muscle loss occurs because the load decreases.

This applies only to people who exercise with an incredible intensity and have a very high muscle mass.

It does not apply to those who are not like that.

I am severely obese and have no experience with exercise at all.

While on a diet, I started running as my exercise.

I hadn't exercised at all, but I started running.

There is an increase in the load on my body due to the emergence of a new burden.

So, doesn't that mean I have to gain muscle no matter what?

However, when I do the InBody test, my muscle mass keeps decreasing.

Why is that?

It is because I lost weight.

Severe obesity means having a heavy weight, and it was said that this heavy weight leads to an increase in muscle mass.

The heavy weight itself has become a burden, which has led to muscle development.

Losing weight through dieting reduces the strain on the body.

Muscle mass decreases because the load decreases.

The burden caused by weight is applied to the body continuously for 24 hours.

The impact is much greater than the strain caused by exercising for 1 to 2 hours a day.

So, if you lose weight, even if you exercise hard, your overall muscle mass can decrease.

If we summarize the content so far in two points,

The first point about muscle growth and muscle loss is not about the type of exercise.

It is determined by the load placed on my body through exercise.

If you perform the second exercise with sufficient intensity and give your body enough load,

Cardio exercise can also lead to muscle growth.

Therefore, it is entirely possible to build muscle and lose weight through aerobic exercise.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

Even if the intensity of the exercise is low and the calories burned are small,

If you exercise for a long time, the total calories burned will be high.

Why does doing low-intensity exercise for a long time have a limited effect on dieting?

Why should the purpose of exercising be muscle growth rather than calorie burning?

It was a question that came up at the beginning of the video, and I mentioned that everyone answered it in the last video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure the previous video appears in the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

I am very busy and it's hard for me to exercise.

I don't have time to exercise.

Even if I force myself to make time to exercise, I can't increase the intensity of my workouts.

If I'm tired the next day, it affects my work.

However, they say that if the exercise intensity is low, there won't be any weight loss effect.

I don't know what to do.

What should someone like me do?

You can proceed step by step.

The intensity of exercise is not absolute, but relative from the beginning.

For example, for a person who works out with a 100kg barbell, exercising with a 30kg barbell has a lower intensity, but...

For a beginner who is trying a barbell for the first time, a 30kg barbell is definitely sufficient in terms of intensity.

If starting to exercise is difficult, you can begin by simply moving your body.

I previously created a detailed explanation video because the same question came up.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right.

When you look at the internet

While I was on a diet, I worked out hard.

I heard that there are reports saying that if you don't exercise now, you will become the type of person who gains weight.

I'm worried that I might end up like that if I exercise while dieting.

Please let me know about this part as well.

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a detailed explanation video about it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.
