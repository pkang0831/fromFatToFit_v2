Is it possible to lose weight without adjusting your diet?

I would like to discuss this question that has come up.

First, let's read the content of the question.

They say that for dieting, diet is more important than exercise, right?

There is a saying that diet is 80 and exercise is 20.

I saw a video where someone said they reduced their waist by 3 inches just by exercising without changing their diet.

I heard that you do 500 burpees every day.

There hasn't been any change in weight, but my waist has gone from 36 to 33.

Looking at the photo, your stomach really looks like it has gone in a lot.

They say that when eating pizza, they would eat two slices at a time, and they also ate two whole chickens at once.

Is it really possible to lose weight while eating like that, no matter how hard you exercise?

It's a question about this kind of content. Let's discuss it in detail.

First, to explain the video mentioned in the question in a bit more detail,

I didn't do 500 burpees from the very beginning.

It is said that an average of 472 were done per day over 100 days.

So at first, I did a small number of burpees.

By gradually increasing the number, I was ultimately able to do 500 every day.

The total number of burpees performed in the last 100 days.

The average value divided by 100 days was 472.

I couldn't do burpees because I felt weak from reducing my food intake.

I didn't control my diet at all, and in fact, I ate even more.

I started at a weight of 82 kg and initially went up to 89 kg.

As time passed, I gradually lost weight and managed to maintain my original weight of 82 kg.

The waist has decreased from 36 to 33, a reduction of 3 inches.

No matter how hard you exercise, is it really possible to eat like that and lose 3 inches off your waist?

The reason this question arises is due to the calorie diet theory.

The calories obtained from consuming food and

Comparing the calories consumed by the body.

If the calorie intake is greater than the calorie expenditure,

The remaining calories are stored as body fat, leading to weight gain.

Conversely, if the calories burned exceed the calories consumed,

You lose weight because your body uses fat to make up for the insufficient calories.

This is the calorie diet theory.

In this theory, it doesn't make sense to reduce your waist by 3 inches by doing 500 burpees without adjusting your diet.

No matter how many calories you burn doing 500 burpees, the calories you get from food are much greater.

It says that I ate 2 chickens at once and also 2 pizzas at a time.

Korean chicken comes in various types, and the calories differ for each.

Based on the fried chicken with the lowest calories.

The calorie content of one unit is approximately 2,000 kcal.

If you ate two, that's 4,000 kcal, right?

If you ate seasoned chicken,

When eating two, you can easily consume 5,000 to 6,000 kcal.

The calories in pizza are similar to those in chicken.

Since there is no mention of eating one meal a day, it is possible that other foods were consumed as well.

No matter how hard you exercise,

It is impossible to burn off all those calories and create a calorie deficit.

It can't be explained by the calorie diet theory.

Then, how can the waist shrink after eating like that?

It's because of the muscles.

If we examine the structure of the waist,

The skin is on the outermost layer.

There is subcutaneous fat under the skin.

There is muscle within the subcutaneous fat.

There are organs and visceral fat within the muscles.

The burpee transforms the body from a vertical position to a horizontal one while sitting.

I keep repeating the act of straightening my body.

When you move like this, your core engages to maintain balance.

In this process, the abdominal muscles, which are the muscles of the stomach, naturally develop.

When the abdominal muscles develop, there is a tightening effect that occurs inside the body.

This will result in a slimmer waist.

If you tighten your waist with shapewear, you can expect your waist to appear slimmer.

Regardless of the calories consumed or burned.

It's a phenomenon that occurs as muscles develop and the body changes through exercise.

So, does that mean that if you do burpees every day without following a diet, anyone can have a 3-inch smaller waist?

No, that's not the case. There are differences among people.

The development of abdominal muscles tightens the waist, resulting in a slimmer waist.

Conversely, if the abdominal muscles are weak, it means that the waist will become thicker.

If the abdominal muscles are weak, they cannot properly support the internal organs and visceral fat.

In this case, the internal organs and visceral fat push the abdominal muscles outward, causing the belly to protrude.

A person with weak abdominal muscles has a thickened waist.

When you develop your abdominal muscles through exercise, your stomach will become flatter, resulting in a more noticeable difference.

If a person has strong abdominal muscles that effectively support their organs and visceral fat,

Even if your abs develop through exercise, there won't be a significant difference.

If you develop your abdominal muscles through exercise, won't you be able to tighten them more, making your waist slimmer?

Even if the trash can seems full, if you press down, space will be created.

However, applying more pressure does not necessarily create more space continuously.

No matter how hard you press, the trash itself doesn't disappear.

The space occupied by trash cannot be resolved unless the trash is disposed of.

There are limits to the space that can be obtained by applying strong force.

In the same concept.

As my abdominal muscles have strengthened, when I press on my abdomen and visceral fat, my stomach goes in and my waist becomes slimmer.

Visceral fat does not disappear.

So there are limitations to making the waist slimmer through exercise.

To further reduce the waist, you need to decrease visceral fat itself.

To do that, you also need to follow a diet.

And if we look at the structure of the waist again,

Subcutaneous fat is located outside of the abdominal muscles.

The structure of abdominal muscles cannot tighten subcutaneous fat.

So, a person with a protruding belly due to subcutaneous fat cannot achieve the same effect.

When men accumulate body fat, it primarily builds up as visceral fat.

Women tend to accumulate body fat primarily as subcutaneous fat.

It also means that it is difficult for women to see results.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

When dieting, many people often focus only on calories.

The effects of diet and exercise are not solely about calorie control.

Just like muscles develop, there are ways to change the body itself.

Second

If you exercise and develop your abdominal muscles,

The abdominal muscles support the internal organs and visceral fat well, creating a tightening effect on the inside of the body.

This can cause the waist to become slimmer.

Third

You can develop your abdominal muscles through exercise, which can help make your waist slimmer.

Even if you exercise hard without a diet, you can still lose some weight to a certain extent.

Just because your abdominal muscles develop doesn't mean that visceral fat will disappear.

This type of diet may be effective in the beginning, but it inevitably has its limitations.

Therefore, a diet also needs to be followed.

I can organize it like this.

Just like a diet that relies solely on exercise has its limits.

A diet that relies solely on food without exercise also has its limits.

To lose weight, you ultimately need to focus on both diet and exercise.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

When women accumulate body fat, it primarily builds up as subcutaneous fat.

Subcutaneous fat is located outside of the muscles.

You said that even if muscles develop through exercise, it doesn't have the effect of tightening and slimming down.

So, does that mean that women don't need to exercise when they are dieting?

No, that's not the case.

Subcutaneous fat is located outside of the muscles, so muscles cannot compress subcutaneous fat.

To reduce body fat, you need to build muscle and increase your activity level.

Exercise is essential for a woman's diet.

I previously made a video about how to exercise because a question came up about it.

In that video, it was also explained why exercise is necessary to reduce body fat.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

You mentioned that diet and exercise not only control calories but also have the effect of changing the body.

I understand that exercise develops muscles and changes the body, but...

How does diet change the body?

It affects hormones.

In fact, hormones are much more important than calories when it comes to dieting.

I used to explain the principles of dieting in detail.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the upper right corner.

You mentioned that in order to reduce visceral fat, one needs to follow a diet.

The person featured in this video consumed between 5,000 and 6,000 kcal.

I understand that I can't burn it all off through exercise, so I need to focus on my diet.

However, for someone with a typical meal portion.

Isn't it possible to reduce body fat by exercising and burning energy without a diet?

Unfortunately, that's not the case.

If you expend energy through exercise and put your body in a state of energy deficiency,

Our bodies respond by trying to maintain balance.

It can increase appetite and encourage eating more food.

The body can change in a way that reduces the energy expended when doing the same exercise.

The person featured in this video is actually

Instead of doing 500 burpees, I ended up eating more food.

The decrease in energy expended during exercise was explained in detail in another video.
