Applying the principles of weight loss to my body is dieting - Evolution Part 2

Humanity in the past lived in environments where food was scarce, and

To survive in such an environment, we evolved to store body fat.

As the environment has changed to one with abundant food, obesity is occurring due to excessive body fat.

If it evolved to store body fat in response to an environment with a lack of food,

Is it possible to evolve in a way that we don't store body fat, given the abundance of food in our environment?

If such evolution is possible, when will that evolution take place?

This question has come up, so I am discussing it.

In the last video, we talked about natural selection, which is the basic concept of evolution.

Evolution is not about individuals changing to fit their environment.

Organisms that are suited to the environment survive selectively, while those that are not do not survive and become extinct.

Just because we survive selectively in harmony with nature,

It is said to be evolution caused by natural selection.

If we apply that natural selection to modern humanity,

It is possible to evolve in a way that allows you to eat a lot of food without storing body fat.

However, it was said that natural selection does not apply to modern humanity.

In this video, I would like to talk about the reasons for that.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it would be good to watch that first.

Let's apply the example of the giraffe and acacia leaves from the last video to humans.

Let's assume that humans are creatures that live by eating acacia leaves, like giraffes.

Due to changes in the climate, there is a shortage of acacia leaves.

The acacia leaves in the low places that everyone could eat have disappeared.

If survival is only possible by eating the leaves of the acacia tree high up,

Humans who are naturally tall and can eat the leaves of acacia trees in high places survive.

Are all naturally short humans dying as natural selection takes place?

That wouldn't be the case, right?

If you make a ladder, even short people can climb to high places.

So, for natural selection to apply, the given environment must not be able to change.

Humans have the ability to change the environment given to them.

Due to this ability, natural selection does not apply.

Let's return to the topic of obesity.

In the past, food was hard to obtain, and carbohydrates were even harder to find.

Only the species capable of surviving in such an environment have survived, and they have become the ancestors of modern humanity.

If such humanity finds itself in an environment where food is easily obtainable and primarily consists of carbohydrates,

It is natural for body fat to increase too much and lead to obesity.

In another video, you mentioned that not all living beings, including humans, are made to become obese.

But now you're saying that becoming obese is natural?

It does not mean that the organism itself is designed to become obese.

In the current environment, it is natural to become obese.

Giraffes need to eat acacia leaves to survive.

As the climate changes, an environment has been created where the leaves of acacia trees in low-lying areas are becoming scarce.

In such an environment, it is natural for a short-necked giraffe to die because it cannot reach the acacia leaves high up.

However, it is not said that a giraffe with a short neck was originally made to starve to death.

It means that the environment has been created in which a giraffe with a short neck has no choice but to starve to death.

Similarly, humans are not inherently designed to become obese.

A situation has been created where humans have no choice but to become obese.

If you don't change that environment, you will inevitably become obese.

So, to solve the problem of obesity, I need to change the environment I am in.

The problem is that everyone is in a different environment.

A diet plan to lose 10 kg in one month.

It's a sentence that anyone who is dieting would be interested in.

However, even if you follow that diet exactly, the same results may not occur.

Because each person has a different weight.

Activity level and exercise amount are different.

The amount of body fat and muscle mass is different.

Everyone has different lifestyle patterns and digestive abilities.

So, a diet that is effective for someone may not be effective for me.

What is easy and convenient for someone else may be difficult for me.

I need to find the right diet method or meal plan for myself.

To find that method, you need to understand the basic principles of dieting.

However, just knowing that principle does not mean it applies in every situation.

When I was young, I could eat without gaining weight.

As I get older, I gain weight even when I eat the same amount.

I had a successful experience with dieting in the past, so I followed the same method as before.

Right now, the diet effect is not as significant as it was back then.

It wasn't difficult to stick to the diet.

Since I started exercising, it's been really hard to stick to my diet.

Such stories are very common.

So, a diet method or meal plan that suits me right now.

This means that when the environment changes, the effects also change.

To cope with such situations,

I need to know how to understand and interpret my body and my environment.

So far, I have uploaded over 200 videos related to dieting on YouTube.

There are some overlapping videos, but...

Most of the videos have different themes or situations in their stories.

However, the same theory is used in all the videos.

The fundamental principle of dieting to reduce body fat in the human body is one.

So, all diet methods can be explained by a single theory.

If you understand a single theory that is spread throughout the entire video,

You can understand the basic principles of dieting.

If you understand how to apply a single theory to various topics and situations,

You will come to understand how to interpret your body and environment.

Those are the two things that will be the most helpful for your diet.

The reason I repeat the same theory across several videos is that I want to share those two things with you.
