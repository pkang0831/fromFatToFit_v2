This is the second video about gut microbiota.

In the last video,

There are a vast number of microorganisms living in our intestines.

Among those microorganisms, there are beneficial bacteria that provide positive effects on the body.

There are harmful bacteria that can have negative effects on the body, as mentioned before.

As beneficial bacteria increase and harmful bacteria decrease, it helps with health and dieting.

To do this, reduce harmful bacteria by not eating processed foods that serve as food for harmful bacteria.

It was said that we should eat unprocessed foods that serve as food for beneficial bacteria in order to increase the beneficial bacteria.

If increasing beneficial gut bacteria helps with health and dieting, then...

Isn't it better to eat the beneficial bacteria themselves rather than their food?

You might think that.

It is a similar concept to taking probiotics for gut health.

However, there is a probiotic called BNR 17 that has been patented for its effectiveness in dieting.

The diet product made with that probiotic is currently being sold.

Does taking this diet product help with dieting?

I would like to talk about the question that has come up.

Since the content continues from the last video, it is better to watch them in order.

The playlist link is available in the description of the video and at the top right.

If you want to see them in order, you can click to view them.

The exact name of BNR 17 is Lactobacillus gasseri BNR 17.

It is also called breast milk probiotic BNR 17 because it is extracted from breast milk probiotics.

For your reference, BNR 17 was extracted from breast milk probiotics.

Breast milk probiotics are not BNR 17.

So if it is labeled simply as "breast milk probiotics" without indicating BNR 17,

That product is not BNR 17.

So if your goal is to buy BNR 17, you need to choose a product that is labeled BNR 17.

Is the product labeled BNR 17 effective for weight loss?

It is said that it has also received certification from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.

It is said that the effects have been proven in experiments conducted on people.

It showed some effectiveness in experiments conducted on people.

So it is true that it has received certification from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.

The effect is not as significant as expected.

Let's talk a bit about the experiment.

Ninety individuals with obesity were divided into three groups.

One group is given a placebo, which means they are given a fake medication.

One group was fed 1 billion low-concentration BNR 17.

The remaining group was fed 10 billion high-concentration BNR 17.

In addition to this, all experiment participants

Reduce daily calorie intake by 200 kcal to have meals of 1500 to 1700 kcal per day.

I aimed to burn 100 kcal through physical activity.

If BNR 17 actually has a weight loss effect,

Compared to the group that took the placebo, the group that actually took BNR 17...

I need to do better with my diet.

The experiment was conducted over a total of 12 weeks.

When comparing these four indicators: weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and visceral fat.

There was no significant difference in weight among the three groups.

The waist circumference showed a reduction of 5 cm in the high-concentration group.

However, the group that took the placebo also showed a decrease of 1.7 cm.

So, the reduction in waist circumference is not the effect of BNR 17.

It could be the effect of eating 200 kcal less per day and moving 100 kcal more.

It's natural for your waist circumference to decrease since you've been eating less and moving more.

The high-dose group had a greater reduction in waist circumference compared to the placebo group.

Shouldn't we consider BNR 17 to be effective?

Yes, that's right.

However, in the low concentration group, the waist circumference increased by 1.3 cm.

It has become a vague situation to say that the waist circumference has decreased due to the effect of BNR 17.

If BNR 17 is effective, the low-dose group would be similar to the placebo group.

It should have decreased a bit more than the placebo group.

The hip circumference decreased in all three groups, but the difference in the degree of reduction was minimal.

Visceral fat increased in the placebo group, but

In other groups, there was a decrease across the board.

However, it decreased more in the low concentration group than in the high concentration group.

So if the diet effects appear significantly in the order of placebo, low concentration, and high concentration,

It has been found that BNR 17 has a dieting effect.

You might think that the higher the concentration, the greater the effect.

In reality, the results did not come out consistently like that.

BNR 17 has an effect. It becomes difficult to say this.

Aren't you eating too little?

Looking at the products sold by BNR 17, it seems that they are designed to be consumed in batches of 50 billion at a time.

Compared to that, 10 billion seems a bit low to be considered high concentration.

Yes, that is a possibility.

So there have been many experiments where people have eaten a lot.

57 people were divided into 2 groups, with one group receiving a placebo and the other group taking BNR 17.

I had them take 2 capsules at a time, three times a day: morning, lunch, and dinner, for a total of 10 billion capsules.

So, that means they ate 60 billion of them in a day.

To check the effects of consuming a large amount of BNR 17 while maintaining my usual lifestyle.

Diet control and exercise were not required.

Similarly, the experiment was conducted over a period of 12 weeks.

The results show that the experimental group had a greater reduction compared to the control group in the overall indicators.

The weight of the placebo group decreased by 0.2 kg, while the experimental group decreased by 1.1 kg, which is a greater reduction.

The hip circumference decreased by 1.1 cm in the control group and by 2.8 cm in the experimental group.

Both weight and hip circumference decreased in both groups, but the experimental group lost more.

In addition, body fat percentage, body mass index, and waist circumference are

The placebo group all increased, but the experimental group all decreased.

Since you eat in large quantities, it really has a dieting effect, doesn't it?

The figures suggest that, but there is a bit of a problem.

When looking at the experimental results in numbers, there is definitely a difference, but...

Considering the margin of error, the difference is too small to be statistically significant.

And looking at the visceral fat indicator,

In the placebo group, visceral fat decreased.

In the experimental group, visceral fat increased.

In fact, weight, body fat percentage, body mass index, waist circumference, and hip circumference are

It's not just body fat; it is also affected by muscle and water.

For example, when body water increases, body weight increases, and when body water decreases, body weight decreases.

When the muscles in the waist and hips stretch or contract, there will be changes in circumference.

Ultimately, the goal of dieting is to reduce body fat.

So, how much actual body fat has been reduced? This is the most important thing.

In fact, the important visceral fat has actually increased.

So, can we really say that this has a dieting effect?

This issue arises.

So, does that mean BNR 17 has no weight loss effect?

It's a bit ambiguous to say it that way.

Because it has shown effectiveness in animal experiments.

By feeding the mice a lot of sugar to make them gain weight,

When comparing rats that consumed BNR 17 with those that did not,

The rat that ate BNR 17 definitely gained less weight.

Then why is there little effect on humans?

There are two main hypotheses regarding this.

The first point is that there are many factors that influence dieting.

The factors that actually influence dieting are

Diet, exercise, sleep, stress, gut microbiota, hormonal metabolism, and a wide variety of vitamins and minerals.

Various factors are influencing this.

Changing just one gut microbe may have minimal effects.

In the case of animal experiments, it is possible to conduct the experiments with everything thoroughly controlled.

You can see the effects of BNR 17, but...

A person cannot do that.

Therefore, it is difficult for people to confirm the effects.

However, if this hypothesis is correct, it will conflict with what has been discussed so far.

The reason many people became interested in gut microbiota in the first place is

It was because of the statement that gut microorganisms have a significant impact on our bodies.

In reality, individuals with an unhealthy composition of gut microbiota are

It was said that you can become obese even if you eat the same amount or less.

Because of that, we created a diet product called BNR 17.

If we suddenly say now that the influence of gut microbiota is not that significant,

What are the various experiments and papers that have discussed the importance of gut microbiota so far?

This raises such questions.

The second hypothesis is that there are too many types and numbers of gut microorganisms.

The number of microorganisms in the human gut is in the tens of trillions, and there are over hundreds of different species.

So many microorganisms are doing various jobs that affect the body.

There are also bacteria that make you want to eat more food.

There are also bacteria that raise blood sugar levels.

There are also bacteria that produce a lot of insulin.

On the contrary, there are various beneficial bacteria that can help with dieting.

In this situation, a specific strain called BNR 17 is

No matter how large that number is, the effect is minimal.

So you can think of it as a smartphone.

Smartphones are made up of a large number of components, and

The overall performance is determined by the combined performance of all those components.

Even if a certain component's performance is exceptionally outstanding,

If the performance of other components is not good, the overall performance of the smartphone will inevitably be low.

To enhance the performance of a smartphone, the performance of all components must be improved.

So, increasing the overall beneficial bacteria that help with dieting is effective, but

It is difficult to achieve a weight loss effect by introducing a specific strain in large quantities.

Then why did it show effectiveness in animal experiments?

Because laboratory mice are much smaller than humans,

The number and types of gut microorganisms are much lower than in humans.

So, when a large amount of a single type of microorganism is administered, there is a possibility that it could be much more effective compared to humans.

In summary, BNR 17 showed effectiveness in animal experiments, but

In experiments involving people, the results may not be consistent or

When looking at the numbers in the experimental data, there are differences, but...

When considering the margin of error, no significant difference was observed.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

You mentioned that it's difficult to achieve weight loss effects if there is a large amount of a specific type of bacteria.

Then, it shouldn't be that a specific bacterium is the sole reason for gaining weight, right?

I heard that there are fat bacteria among the gut microbes that make us gain weight.

What is this?

There are fat bacteria that make us obese, and we need to eliminate them in order to lose weight.

There are a lot of advertisements and stories with this kind of content.

The truth is a little different.

In the next video, let's talk about obesity bacteria, also known as fat bacteria.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears in the top right corner.

If the video is not completed, another video is scheduled to be released.

If the video that appears in the upper right is not part 3 of the gut microbiome,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
