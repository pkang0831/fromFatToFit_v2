When the basal metabolic rate decreases, the desire to eat snacks increases.

I am diligently following a diet plan, but I keep seeing comments about wanting to eat snacks.

I am talking about the reasons why I crave snacks while on a diet.

In the first and second videos, we discussed cases where there are issues with diet composition.

In the third video, we talked about the desire to chew.

In this video, I would like to talk about the digestive system.

I briefly mentioned it in the last video.

When you go on a diet, the amount of food you eat and the calories will decrease.

First of all, this action itself is correct.

The reason for becoming obese, regardless of the cause, ultimately comes down to eating more than necessary.

Therefore, in order to diet, you should not eat more than necessary.

So it's correct to reduce the amount of food you eat and cut down on calories, but...

The issue is the amount being reduced.

If you reduce it to an appropriate amount, you can lose weight while maintaining your basal metabolic rate.

When you reduce your intake excessively, it can lead to a decrease in your basal metabolic rate.

And because of this, there may be a phenomenon where you start craving snacks.

Increasing muscle mass through exercise raises the basal metabolic rate.

When the basal metabolic rate increases, it becomes a body type that does not easily gain weight.

It's a story that's quite famous in the context of dieting.

Because of this story, there is a misunderstanding that most of the basal metabolic rate is consumed by muscle.

The proportion of muscle in the basal metabolic rate is about 20% of the total.

Most of the energy is consumed by major organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

The statement that basal metabolic rate decreases means that

This means that the energy used by major organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs decreases.

Saying that the energy used is reduced means that the functionality is diminished.

Major organs also include the digestive system.

When the function of the digestive system decreases, the ability to digest and absorb also diminishes.

In the video, it was mentioned that the basic principle of dieting is to reduce the amount of food you eat.

To be precise, it is about reducing the amount of food that is digested and absorbed.

So the foods you eat while dieting are either low in nutritional density or

It's a food that is not easily digestible, like whole grains.

In short, diet food refers to foods that are difficult to digest and absorb.

When you eat such foods with a decreased function of the digestive system,

Because digestion is not functioning properly, the stomach feels uncomfortable or...

Because it is not properly absorbed, you will want to eat again.

And the food I want to eat at this time is snacks or cake.

Snacks and cakes are easy to digest and absorb, and they have a high nutritional density, such as calories.

The cause of the problem is that the basal metabolic rate has decreased, leading to a decline in the function of the digestive system.

Restoring your basal metabolic rate will solve the problem.

How to recover from a state of low basal metabolic rate.

In the fifth part of the basal metabolic rate series that I created earlier, I talked about it in detail.

The video link is available in the top right corner.

If you are curious about how to recover, you can click here to see.

Originally, this series was planned to conclude with this video.

I miss the sweet and salty taste of snacks so much that I saw a comment saying they want to eat snacks.

In the next video, I will talk about ways to solve the craving for snacks due to their taste.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not about the taste of snacks,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
