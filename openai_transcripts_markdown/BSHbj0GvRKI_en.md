Exercises effective for reducing body fat

Hello, this is pkang.

The topic of this video is the best exercises for dieting.

In another video, you said that even if you burn calories through exercise, it doesn't reduce body fat, right?

Yes, that's right.

The reduction of body fat does not solely depend on the calories burned through exercise.

However, exercising itself has the effect of reducing body fat.

In the video, it is stated that body fat does not decrease solely based on the calories burned through exercise.

I wanted to say that you don't have to obsess over exercises that burn a lot of calories.

I've seen quite a few comments misunderstanding that exercise is not necessary for dieting.

In this video, I would like to talk about how exercise affects body fat reduction.

When people often exercise for the purpose of dieting,

Anaerobic exercise is effective for building muscle.

It is said that aerobic exercise is effective in reducing body fat.

However, exercise is not divided into aerobic and anaerobic types based on the kind of exercise.

It is commonly thought that running is an aerobic exercise and weight training is an anaerobic exercise.

If you run slowly for about an hour, it is considered aerobic exercise.

If you sprint 100 meters, it is close to anaerobic exercise.

Performing high-weight, low-repetition weight training with heavy weights is an anaerobic exercise, but

Performing low-weight, high-repetition weights is similar to aerobic exercise.

It is not divided into aerobic and anaerobic based on the type of exercise.

How you exercise depends on the method you use.

So, when distinguishing between exercises that are effective for building muscle and those that are effective for losing body fat,

It is somewhat ambiguous to categorize exercise as aerobic or anaerobic.

So how can we distinguish between exercises that are effective for building muscle and those that are effective for losing body fat?

It can be divided into low-intensity exercise and high-intensity exercise.

For example, the exercises that we think are effective for building muscle are

In a fixed position like a squat,

It's an exercise where you increase the number of repetitions or add weight.

This type of exercise definitely involves a lot of movement for the muscles in the targeted area.

It is not a high-activity exercise.

You exercise while maintaining a fixed posture, so you don't move your body around.

On the other hand, the exercises that are considered effective for reducing body fat are

It's an exercise like running that involves moving the whole body.

Such exercises distribute the load of the workout throughout the entire body.

Although each muscle experiences a small load,

It is an exercise that involves a lot of activity for the whole body.

So, to summarize again,

It means that exercises with higher activity levels are more effective for reducing body fat than those with lower activity levels.

Is it true that exercises with high activity levels burn more calories and therefore reduce body fat more effectively?

No, that's not the case.

I mentioned it at the beginning of the video as well.

The reduction of body fat does not solely depend on the calories burned through exercise.

Moreover, the calorie expenditure from weight training is not significantly less than that of running.

Depending on the intensity of the exercise, the calorie expenditure can sometimes be greater than that of running.

If it is true that body fat decreases according to the calories burned through exercise,

Whether you are doing weight training or running, the reduction in body fat should be similar.

In practice, running is more effective for losing body fat than weight training.

The reason for this difference is due to activity level, not calories.

Body fat is often considered energy stored in the body.

You need to be in a state of energy deficiency to use body fat as energy.

Therefore, it is necessary to create a situation where there is a lack of energy in order to lose weight.

There are quite a few people who think this way.

However, that's not necessarily the case.

The human body distinguishes between what is necessary and what is not, depending on the situation.

If it's not needed, get rid of it, and if it's needed, increase it.

For example, when you exercise, your body requires a lot of muscles.

In this situation, the body tries to increase muscle mass.

On the contrary, if you don't exercise, your body doesn't need a lot of muscle.

In such situations, muscle loss occurs, leading to a decrease in muscle mass.

Similarly, in situations where it is easy to obtain food,

Since excess body fat is not needed as emergency food, a response to reduce body fat occurs.

On the contrary, in situations where it is difficult to obtain food,

The body responds by conserving body fat and trying to increase the amount of body fat.

So, when dieting with a low-calorie diet that involves eating less food,

At first, body fat decreases easily, but...

As time passes, it becomes difficult to obtain food, which leads the body to misunderstand the situation.

As a response to trying to conserve body fat, the effectiveness of the diet gradually decreases.

It is said that the response to increase body fat becomes stronger, making it easy to experience a yo-yo effect.

On the contrary, if you eat well, it triggers a response to reduce body fat.

It's about the idea that dieting can be more effective.

You want to reduce body fat by eating well, right?

Then why is there obesity in the first place? Even if you eat a lot, body fat should decrease, right?

It is because there is a problem with the type of food being eaten.

In the video on how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods.

Processed foods that cause excessive insulin secretion are considered fattening foods.

Insulin is a hormone that has the effect of increasing body fat.

If you frequently consume foods that cause a lot of insulin to be released,

Even if the body wants to reduce body fat, it can find itself in a situation where it cannot do so.

So, if you eat foods that do not cause a lot of insulin to be released,

It is possible to reduce body fat without eating less food while enduring hunger.

This means to diet while eating, without starving yourself.

This is important from here on.

The reason for the response to reduce unused muscles in the body is

It is to prevent the waste of energy.

Muscles are organs that continuously consume energy just by being present.

Having unused muscles poses a problem of wasting energy.

The body tries to reduce energy waste.

It's a response to reduce unnecessary muscles that are not being used.

The reason body fat decreases is also because energy is being wasted.

When moving a light object, a small amount of energy is sufficient.

To move a heavy object, a lot of energy is needed.

A body with a lot of body fat is very heavy, and therefore requires a lot of energy to move.

If it is not a situation where it is difficult to obtain food

There’s no need to carry around a lot of excess body fat.

Using a lot of energy while carrying unnecessary body fat is a waste of energy.

The more active you are, the greater the waste of energy becomes.

As the waste of energy increases, the body reacts by trying to reduce body fat more quickly.

Because of this, while the calorie expenditure is similar, it is less than that of weight training, which involves less activity.

Exercises with high activity levels, such as running, tend to have a more significant effect on reducing body fat.

To summarize,

Increasing physical activity through exercise itself is effective in reducing body fat.

This means that it is possible to lose weight even without exercises that burn a lot of calories.

For example, in the case of someone working in an office with extremely low levels of physical activity,

You can lose weight through walking exercises.

Because my level of activity has increased compared to usual.

There are many cases of people who typically had low activity levels losing weight through walking exercises.

However, for someone who usually walks often,

Even if you engage in walking exercises, body fat does not decrease easily.

Since I usually walk a lot, I already have a certain level of activity.

In this case, increasing the intensity of your exercise by running is more effective.

But it's not that you shouldn't do exercises that burn a lot of calories, right?

Yes, that's right.

If you want to do exercises that burn a lot of calories, you can do so.

However, there is a misunderstanding that a high calorie expenditure is necessary for body fat to be lost.

There's no need to force it.

Just because you burn a lot of calories doesn't mean you'll necessarily lose a lot of body fat.

And exercises that burn a lot of calories are difficult and challenging.

If you are not used to exercising, it is naturally difficult to do.

However, if one misunderstands that weight loss can only happen through such exercise,

Because it feels overwhelming, there are cases where people don't even start dieting.

Even if you are on a diet,

There are cases where people think, "I can't do that kind of exercise," and end up not exercising at all.

But I'm saying not to do that.

Even if I do exercises that suit my body, I can see sufficient results, so it means I can exercise according to what works for my body.

And for someone who is not accustomed to exercise, doing such workouts significantly increases the risk of injury.

Exercises known for burning a lot of calories include the burpee test and spinning.

A person who is not accustomed to exercising may experience knee problems while doing the burpee test.

It is quite common to see cases where problems occur in the lower back while spinning.

If you consistently stick to your diet and exercise anyway,

The body becomes lighter, muscles develop, and exercise becomes familiar.

Then, you can continue to increase the difficulty while minimizing the strain on your body.

There's no need to do that from the very beginning.

An exercise with a slightly challenging intensity that I can continue to do without giving up.

It is the best exercise for dieting.
