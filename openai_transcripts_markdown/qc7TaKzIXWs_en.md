Hello, this is pkang.

A question about stagnation has come up in the comments, so I will talk about stagnation.

First, it is necessary to briefly define what a stagnation period is.

Many people use the term "stagnation period," but

Not everyone uses it with the same meaning.

Some people do lose weight, but...

If the weight loss slows down compared to the beginning of the diet, it's referred to as a plateau.

Some people say that if there is no change in weight, it is a plateau.

Some people say that if there is no change in body shape, it is a plateau, not just a matter of weight.

Among these, there are some that are indeed in a stagnation period.

There are also fake identity crises that are misunderstood as a period of stagnation.

The first case is when weight decreases, but it happens slowly.

It's a phenomenon caused by body water, which was mentioned in the trap video that makes people give up on dieting.

Regardless of which diet method you choose, this phenomenon occurs in all diets.

It is certainly not a period of stagnation.

If you have questions about body water,

The video link is available in the upper right corner, so you can click on it for reference.

In the case where there is no change in weight.

This is really a stagnation period or

The weight loss from reduced body fat and the weight gain from increased muscle mass are occurring in the same situation.

Since the weight lost and the weight gained are the same, there is no change in weight.

In this case, there is no change in weight, but body fat is decreasing and muscle mass is increasing.

It is the most perfect situation for dieting, and of course, it is not a plateau.

How can I check if I'm losing fat and gaining muscle, or if I'm really at a plateau?

The simplest way is to take a photo every day to see the changes in your body shape.

If there is no change in body shape, then it is indeed a plateau.

If your body shape is gradually becoming slimmer, it means that your muscle mass is increasing and your body fat is decreasing.

Changes in body shape occur slowly, so it's difficult to notice them in just a day or two.

You need to take photos for at least a week to be able to distinguish them properly.

In the case where there is no change in weight and body shape for the third time.

The lack of change in body shape means that the muscles are not growing.

If your muscles are not growing and there is no change in weight, it means that body fat is not decreasing either.

If this situation continues for a long time, then it is indeed a stagnation period.

If this is really a period of stagnation, then I need to break free from it.

To break free from a stagnation period, you need to understand the causes of that stagnation.

The most fundamental reason is that a balance has been established that maintains weight.

To break out of a stagnation, you need to shake up this balance.

Otherwise, you need to create a new balance for losing weight.

This balance is created through homeostasis.

To talk about stagnation, an explanation of homeostasis is necessary.

Usually, it is referred to as homeostasis.

Many people simply understand it as the degree of effort to return to their original weight.

If you think of homeostasis as this kind of force, a question arises.

In a situation where a person who was obese is dieting, their original weight is the obese weight.

It is difficult to diet due to the power of homeostasis aiming for an obese weight.

Up to this point, this is what we know.

However, in a situation where a person who was of normal weight gradually gains weight and becomes obese,

The original weight is within the normal range.

If homeostasis is the force that tries to return to the original weight.

Due to the power of homeostasis that aims to return to a normal weight, one should not become obese.

There are cases where a plateau occurs due to homeostasis, making it difficult to lose weight.

There are cases where a plateau occurs due to homeostasis, and it's not uncommon for weight not to increase.

Why does homeostasis interfere with dieting but fail to prevent obesity?

To understand why this is happening, you need to properly identify the cause of the stagnation.

In the next video, I will talk about what homeostasis is and why it occurs.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure to include it in the video on the right.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the traffic jam video,

I am still in the process of making the second part of the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

If the video was helpful, please like and subscribe.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
