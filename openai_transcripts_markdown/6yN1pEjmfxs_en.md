This is the third video about late-night snacks.

In the first video, we talked about the issue of eating late-night snacks due to dietary habits.

In the second video, we talked about eating late-night snacks due to sleep disorders.

In this video, even if there are no issues with eating habits and sleep,

The reasons why a habit of eating late-night snacks develops and

I would like to talk about how to change late-night snacking habits.

A behavior that is repeated regularly is called a habit.

The reason this habit develops is due to the rewards from repeated actions.

When a certain action is taken, positive rewards are obtained.

As it becomes a good memory through learning, I feel like I want to do it again.

So when you repeat the same behavior, it unconsciously becomes a habit.

For example, eating a late-night snack while watching your favorite movie or drama.

Relieving stress from work by eating late-night snacks or

On weekends, I want to do something special that’s different from the weekdays.

It's hard to do other things, but since I don't have to go to work, I don't have to wake up early.

Creating a party atmosphere with late-night snacks.

If this situation repeats, the act of eating late-night snacks itself will be learned as a positive memory.

This repeats, and that's how the habit of eating late-night snacks develops.

To solve this,

Breaking the habit of eating late-night snacks.

Developing a habit of not eating late-night snacks.

You need to proceed with both of these at the same time.

As mentioned earlier,

The reason habits form is that positive memories are learned repeatedly.

To break the habit of eating late-night snacks, you first need to weaken this positive memory.

For example, if you enjoy eating late-night snacks while watching your favorite movies or dramas,

First, you need to separate watching movies and dramas from eating late-night snacks.

If you want to eat a late-night snack, you can go ahead and eat it.

When eating a late-night snack, you should turn off the movie or drama.

You should focus entirely on having a late-night snack without doing anything else.

And after finishing the late-night snack, we watch movies or dramas.

The reason for doing this is to enjoy movies and dramas.

It is to prevent being misled by the pleasure of late-night snacks.

If you often relieve stress from work by eating late-night snacks,

You need to find other ways to relieve stress instead of eating late-night snacks.

It's about separating stress relief from late-night snacks.

In fact, eating is the easiest way to relieve stress, but...

It can lead to stress eating or obesity.

You should avoid relieving stress through food as much as possible.

Listening to music, meditating, singing, shouting, sleeping, dancing, doing light exercise, and taking walks.

There are various methods, so you should find a stress relief method that suits you.

If you have weakened the good memories associated with late-night snacks using the method mentioned earlier,

Now, we need to break the habit of eating late-night snacks.

The reason habits form is that positive rewards lead to good memories being learned repeatedly.

On the contrary, if negative reinforcement leads to the repeated learning of bad memories,

It is possible to break a habit.

Late-night snacks can lead to sleeping without proper digestion.

When I wake up in the morning, I feel bloated and tired.

This is a negative reward for late-night snacks, but

There are quite a few cases where I can't connect it to late-night snacks.

I had a late-night snack last night.

The bloating is due to the significant time difference from this morning.

First, we need to start by thinking about how to connect these two things.

If you feel bloated and tired this morning,

You have to think that it's because of the late-night snack you had last night.

If you want to have a late-night snack tonight,

I should expect to feel bloated and tired tomorrow morning.

Rather than just thinking about it,

It is better to speak with my own mouth so that I can hear it with my own ears.

There is a bit of a self-suggestion effect.

If you keep doing this, you'll start to hesitate a bit when eating late-night snacks.

Until now, I haven't thought at all about the problems that arise from eating late-night snacks.

So if I wanted a late-night snack, I would just eat it without thinking.

Right now, I'm thinking that if I eat a late-night snack, tomorrow morning will be tough.

You need to make the most of this slight hesitation.

It would have been a late-night snack that I would normally just eat.

If you're having a bit of hesitation about whether to eat or not,

Just try going to bed without having a late-night snack for one day.

In Part 1 of the video, there was a mention of being hungry due to meal timing issues.

The craving for late-night snacks due to sleep disorders mentioned in Part 2 of the video is

There is a clear reason why you might crave late-night snacks.

Therefore, if the cause is not addressed, it is quite difficult to resist late-night snacks.

However, the late-night snacks that we eat out of habit don't have a clear reason for wanting them.

I just eat late-night snacks out of habit.

Actions that are done habitually and automatically are...

It's hard to stop because I'm just doing it.

If there is a reason to stop, it can just come to a halt.

A slight hesitation becomes the turning point.

So, I was about to have a late-night snack.

"Tomorrow morning, I might feel uncomfortable and it will be tough, so should I just not eat?"

When such thoughts come to mind,

"Okay, let's just sleep and not eat today."

It means that it's possible to sleep without eating like this.

If you go to sleep without having a late-night snack like this,

The next morning, there will definitely be a difference.

Since I didn't eat a late-night snack, I don't feel bloated or tired.

You should think of this positive reward in connection with not eating late-night snacks.

I didn't have a late-night snack last night, so I feel comfortable in my stomach and my body feels good this morning.

Rather than just thinking about this simply,

I like to say it with my own mouth and hear it with my own ears.

The positive rewards that come from not eating late-night snacks.

By repeatedly learning from good memories, you can develop the habit of not eating late-night snacks.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

The first behavior that is repeated regularly is called a habit.

A habit is formed when a positive reward is obtained from a certain behavior.

It is formed through repetitive learning of good memories.

The reason for developing a habit of eating a second late-night snack is

This is because good memories of late-night snacks have been learned repeatedly.

To change the habit of eating a third late-night snack,

First, weaken the good memories associated with late-night snacks.

Recognizing the negative consequences of late-night snacks.

I need to repeatedly learn from bad memories.

By repeatedly learning good memories about not eating late-night snacks,

You should develop the habit of not eating late-night snacks.

I can organize it like this.

So far, we have talked about late-night snacks in parts 1, 2, and 3.

In most cases, the situations of Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 are often mixed together in a complex manner.

So when only one method is used, the effectiveness may be somewhat reduced.

It is recommended to practice all three methods simultaneously if possible.

I hope this helps a little in changing your late-night snacking habits.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

I watched the video well.

Change your perception, change your thoughts. This feels a bit abstract.

Does it make sense that just changing your thoughts would lead to such effects?

It makes perfect sense.

There have been experiments where people changed their thinking based on information they didn't actually know, and that alone led to weight loss.

It is an experiment targeting housekeepers.

I talked about it in detail in another video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top left.

If you're curious about the experiment where simply changing your mindset led to weight loss, you can click to see more.

I find late-night snacks so delicious that I want to keep eating them. Is there no way to solve this?

There is a way.

In the past, I loved the taste of foods that make you gain weight, so I saw comments saying that dieting is difficult.

Why I came to like the taste of foods that make you gain weight.

And I made a video about how to change it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the upper right corner.

The bigger problem is that I prefer alcohol over late-night snacks.

Please tell me about alcohol and dieting.

Alcohol has calories, but it does not get stored as body fat.

I've heard that drinking alcohol instead of eating rice can actually lead to weight loss.

I heard that because of that, all the alcoholics have become thin.

Is that really true?

There have been a lot of questions about alcohol and dieting, so I made a series of videos on the topic.

I will make sure to have videos about alcohol and dieting appear in the bottom left.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
