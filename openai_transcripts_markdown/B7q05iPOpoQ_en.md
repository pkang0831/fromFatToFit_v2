The topic of this video is whether consuming fat leads to fat accumulation.

Recently, someone left a question in the comments.

If carbohydrates are converted into glucose and then become fat,

Doesn't consuming fat lead to fat accumulation?

Glucose is the most commonly burned energy source.

Shouldn't we be eating more carbohydrates than fats, like around 250g a day?

I eat more than 200g a day, is that not okay? This is the question I received.

If we break this question down into two parts,

You are referring to glucose and carbohydrates, right?

Is the first carbohydrate the most used energy source in our body?

Does consuming a second fat lead to fat accumulation?

This can be divided into two questions.

I will respond with a total of 2 videos, one for each.

In this video, I will discuss whether consuming fat leads to fat accumulation.

Is carbohydrates the most used energy source in our body? If you're curious,

When we talk about dieting

The nutrients that I pay the most attention to are carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

Carbohydrates are divided into refined carbohydrates and unrefined carbohydrates.

Refined carbohydrates refer to white rice, which is made by removing the husk from the rice.

Flour made by grinding wheat.

Sugar made by squeezing, filtering, and boiling sugarcane.

Carbohydrates that are processed into a form that is easily absorbed by the human body are called refined carbohydrates.

Because it is absorbed very quickly, it has the characteristic of rapidly increasing blood sugar levels.

Unrefined carbohydrates refer to carbohydrates that are unprocessed, such as those found in fruits and vegetables.

Let's consider this as basic knowledge.

To answer the question that appeared at the beginning of the video, "If you eat fat, does it go to fat?"

If you eat too much fat, it will indeed turn into fat.

In that case, when talking about dieting, we should say that we need to reduce the fat that goes to fat.

You might be wondering why I keep talking about carbohydrates.

And I believe this thought is the essence of the question you originally asked.

Because fat alone cannot be consumed in large enough quantities to cause obesity.

What this is about is

If you search for "side effects of a low-carb, high-fat diet" on the internet,

While limiting daily carbohydrate intake to less than 30g or 50g,

There is a review from someone who follows a diet that includes protein and fat.

What is the common point of this review?

At the beginning of starting a diet, there is a tendency to feel increasingly greasy and unappetizing, leading to a dislike for meat.

In that case, in general situations, I don't eat because I don't want to.

However, because I have to write a post on the blog, take a test, or write an article,

Even though I don't want to eat, I keep forcing myself to eat, and as a result, my body starts to experience side effects.

And this is not just a characteristic of fat; carbohydrates and proteins also share the same characteristics.

Unrefined carbohydrates contain carbohydrates, but the amount is low, making it difficult to consume enough to cause any issues in the body.

I have to eat an enormous amount every single day.

Of course, if you keep eating that amount, you'll get full and find it hard to eat more.

So, with unrefined carbohydrates, issues of carbohydrate excess do not occur easily.

In the case of protein, if you eat a lot of it, it can be overwhelming.

If you visit a community where people are dedicated to exercising hard,

There are really a lot of posts about getting tired of eating too much chicken breast.

So, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, if consumed in excessive amounts under normal circumstances,

Trying to reduce intake in a way that makes you lose your appetite is a basic response of the body to maintain balance.

However, refined carbohydrates disrupt the balance.

Refined carbohydrates have a very high carbohydrate content.

Refined carbohydrates have the characteristic that you can eat fats and proteins without any limits.

In other words, if it weren't for these refined carbohydrates, balance would have been maintained on its own.

It means that you probably didn't eat too much fat, protein, or carbohydrates.

So when talking about dieting,

It should be emphasized that we need to reduce refined carbohydrates, not fats.

Now, the person who asked an additional question mentioned that they are consuming 200g of carbohydrates per day.

If you are consuming 200g of refined carbohydrates, I think it's not good because they are refined carbohydrates.

If you are consuming unrefined carbohydrates, you are likely eating a significant amount of fruits and vegetables.

In this case, there is an issue of excessive dietary fiber.

When we talk about dietary fiber, it absorbs cholesterol in the body and helps to eliminate it.

It is known to be beneficial for health as it serves as food for beneficial gut bacteria.

This is also based on a standard amount.

Excessive amounts of dietary fiber can be difficult to digest, putting a strain on the intestines.

Dietary fiber not only absorbs cholesterol but also

It has the characteristic of absorbing other nutrients like zinc and iron together.

So if you continue to consume too much dietary fiber, it can lead to nutrients being flushed out.

Rather, it can lead to nutritional imbalance.

Excess of anything is not good.

It is best to have an appropriate amount, as excess is not good.

Eat an appropriate amount of fruits and vegetables.

By consuming it this way, your carbohydrate intake decreases and your calorie intake also decreases, right?

How about filling in those insufficient calories through meat?
