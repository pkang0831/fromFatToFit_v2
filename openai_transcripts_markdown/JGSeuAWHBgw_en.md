How to Lose Weight While Drinking - Part 3: Alcohol and Diet

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video about alcohol and dieting.

In Part 1 of the video, the reasons why alcohol is not good for dieting are discussed.

In the second part of the video, if you drink alcohol while maintaining your calorie intake...

We talked about the experiment that shows weight actually decreases.

In this video, I will talk about how to diet while drinking alcohol.

Since the content continues from Part 1, it is better to watch them in order.

For those who haven't watched Part 1 of the video, the link is available in the top right corner.

You can click and view them in order.

Before the current series on alcohol and dieting that I am working on, I made a video about alcohol.

Among the questions in the comments of that video, there was this question.

If you search for alcohol and diet on YouTube,

There is a video that explains how to diet while drinking alcohol.

Beer has a lot of carbohydrates, so drink soju instead.

Limit drinking gatherings to no more than twice a week.

Do not drink more than two cups at a time.

They say to eat snacks that are mainly protein and won't make you gain weight, or to have a salad.

Does this method really work?

Yes, it is effective.

If the same calories are maintained in the second part of the video,

I mentioned an experiment that showed drinking alcohol doesn't lead to weight gain.

The alcohol we drink also contains carbohydrates.

You said that experiments do not apply to reality, but...

If you drink distilled water without carbohydrates, the carbohydrates in alcohol won't be a problem.

If you eat snacks that are high in protein or have a salad, the calories will be lower.

And if you drink alcohol less than twice a week and no more than two drinks at a time,

The amount of alcohol consumed is small, so it may not negatively affect the diet.

There are studies that show no change in weight when alcohol is consumed at such frequency.

The issue is whether "this is realistic."

Many people struggle with alcohol while dieting because

Because I have no choice but to attend unwanted drinking gatherings.

It's because of company gatherings or meetings with friends.

And in a drinking gathering where many people meet, the method mentioned at the beginning of the video cannot be used.

Because there are people drinking with me, I can't choose the types of alcohol and snacks freely.

It's tough to even drink just two glasses of alcohol.

So what should I do?

Just drink comfortably.

Many people when they are on a diet

I want my diet to end quickly because I hope to lose body fat rapidly, but...

Body fat does not decrease quickly, and dieting takes a long time.

Body fat changes slowly in the first place.

However, this also applies when body fat increases.

A person who becomes obese does not become obese overnight.

Due to poor eating and lifestyle habits, body fat has gradually increased over a long period of time.

That's how the increased body fat led to obesity.

As mentioned in parts 1 and 2 of the video,

Drinking alcohol is not good for dieting and makes us gain weight, but

Every time I have a drinking session, my body fat doesn't increase explosively.

Just because you have a drinking occasion sometimes doesn't mean you can't diet.

However, when I drink alcohol and the next day comes, my weight has increased significantly.

Yes, that's right. But not all of that is body fat.

I talked about it in a video about binge eating during the diet I started recently.

If you have suddenly gained a lot of weight, most of that weight is likely water weight.

If you respond correctly, it can return to normal in a few days.

So if it's an unavoidable drinking occasion, you don't have to stress too much.

There is one rule that must be followed.

You should never drink more alcohol than your own limit.

I have a lot of things to do the next day.

The next video will explain why excessive drinking is not advisable.

I will talk about what to do the day after drinking.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure to have it appear on the right.

If the video on the right is not part 4 of the alcohol and diet series,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
