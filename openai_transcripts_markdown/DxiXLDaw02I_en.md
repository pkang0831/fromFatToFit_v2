The topic of this video is about what the appropriate intake amount of carbohydrates is.

A question was posted in the comments, but the content is too long, so let me summarize it for you.

I would like to know the appropriate carbohydrate intake for adult men and women who are not on a diet. Can you provide that information?

I understand that refined carbohydrates can be endlessly consumed, which can interfere with dieting.

However, is it okay if I eat refined carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in moderation while keeping the total calorie intake appropriate?

By doing this, muscle mass decreases due to refined carbohydrates, and fat takes its place.

I understand that weight can be maintained while body fat percentage increases. Is this incorrect information?

You left a comment like this.

If we summarize the question, it can be divided into two parts.

1. What is the appropriate intake amount of carbohydrates?

2. Is it okay to eat refined carbohydrates as long as I control my calories?

The second question is about a video we made earlier titled "Does eating fat lead to fat accumulation?"

The person who wrote this comment had asked other questions as well.

"Carbohydrates have 4 kcal per gram, while fats have 9 kcal per gram, so it seems that fats, having a higher calorie content, are the reason for obesity."

"You asked why we should reduce carbohydrates instead of fats."

In response to this question, I created a video titled "Does eating fat lead to fat accumulation?"

The video talks about refined carbohydrates.

Refined carbohydrates  
Refined processed carbohydrates such as rice, wheat, and sugar  
They quickly and significantly raise blood sugar levels and stimulate appetite.

I mentioned that refined carbohydrates are not good for dieting because they have the characteristic of being endlessly consumable.

So, you are asking if it's okay to eat refined carbohydrates as long as you don't eat them endlessly, right?

Since there are two questions, I will create two videos. In this video, we will look into carbohydrate intake.

As the low-carb, high-fat diet has become widely known, there has been a growing awareness that carbohydrate intake should be reduced.

Many people have questions about how much they should reduce.

The most famous answer to this question on the internet is Dr. Paul Zamynett's classification method.

Dr. Paul Jaminet categorized it into a total of five stages.

Less than 50g per day: Insufficient amounts may lead to health issues.

50~100g: Weight loss effect

100~150g: Weight maintenance

150~300g: Weight gain

More than 300g: There is a risk of diabetes if consumed for a long period.

In a ketogenic diet, which intentionally restricts carbohydrates to induce a state of ketosis in the body,

The method I followed is to limit daily carbohydrate intake to below 50g.

You just need to know that there is such a classification method; it is not a rule that must be strictly followed.

Carbohydrates are used in various places, with the most representative uses being in the brain and muscles.

However, since the amount of muscle varies from person to person, the required amount of carbohydrates also differs. The same goes for the brain.

Everyone has different standards.

The amount of carbohydrates that is insufficient for one person may be sufficient for another.

A good example of this is the ketogenic diet.

To follow a ketogenic diet, you need to eat fewer carbohydrates to enter ketosis and promote ketone production.

For this, ketone test strips are used to measure whether ketones are being produced.

According to this classification method, if you consume less than 50g, ketones should be produced, but in reality, that is not the case.

People who consume less than 50g have measured and found no ketones, so they sometimes reduce their intake to 30g or 20g.

People who consume a small amount of carbohydrates for their brain and muscles may not enter ketosis even if they eat less than 50g per day.

People who use a lot of carbohydrates in their brain and muscles can enter ketosis even if they consume more than 50g in a day.

So, please consider this classification as a reference, and in reality, it is best to eat the amount of carbohydrates that suits your body.

So how can I know the amount of carbohydrates my body needs?

There is no way to measure this. We can only infer it by observing the body's reactions.

If you want to eat carbohydrates, increase your intake because you are lacking them.

If you don't want to eat carbohydrates, that means you're satisfied, so you can reduce your intake.

In the end, it comes to the conclusion that you can eat as much as you want. This is unavoidable.

This is because the amount of carbohydrates needed varies for each person, and even for the same person, it can change depending on the situation.

For example, in the case of an obese person weighing 100 kg,

To move a body weighing 100 kg, the muscles will develop.

The reason a person with obesity shows a high muscle mass during an InBody measurement is this.

The muscles needed to move the body are more developed than those of an average person.

Because there is a lot of muscle in the body, the amount of carbohydrates needed is also high.

However, if you diligently diet and lose weight, the muscles needed to move a body that weighs 100 kg will no longer be necessary.

So, naturally, muscle mass decreases.

So, when dieting, muscle loss occurs.

In that case, since muscle mass decreases, the amount of carbohydrates needed will also decrease.

However, after losing weight, I wanted to shape my body, so I worked out hard.

In this case, muscle mass will increase again, and the amount of carbohydrates needed will also increase.

Because even the same person keeps changing.

It doesn't make sense to limit the amount of carbohydrates you eat.

In the case of refined carbohydrates, avoid them as they can confuse the body about the amount it needs.

If we base it on unrefined carbohydrates,

Eating as much as I want is the appropriate amount of carbohydrates for my body.

Sounds plausible, right?

The link to the next video should be appearing in the top right corner.

In the next video, we will address the second question.

I will discuss whether it is okay to consume refined carbohydrates while controlling calorie intake.
