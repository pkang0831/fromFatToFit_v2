Hello, this is pkang.

This is the sixth video about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In Part 1 of the video, the types of low-carb, high-fat diets are discussed.

In the second part of the video, a strange low-carb, high-fat diet is created by mixing two different meal plans.

In Part 3 of the video, we will discuss refined foods and unrefined foods.

In Part 4 of the video, a balanced diet is discussed.

In part 5 of the video, we talked about the recommended diet.

At the end of the fifth video, there was a question asking whether a low-carb diet is better for weight loss.

In this video, I will talk about low-carbohydrate diets.

Since the content of the video is all connected,

You need to watch from Part 1 in order to understand the content without any misunderstandings.

For those who haven't watched Part 1, the playlist link is available in the top right corner.

By clicking, you can watch the first part of the video in order.

First of all, it is true that too many carbohydrates have a negative impact on dieting.

To put it simply, the reason is...

When carbohydrates enter the body, they are converted into glucose and spread throughout the body via the bloodstream.

If you consume too many carbohydrates from processed foods featured in the video in Part 3,

Too many carbohydrates are entering the body.

The number of glucose in the blood increases too much, causing blood sugar levels to rise.

If high blood sugar levels are maintained, inflammation occurs in the walls of the blood vessels.

The body releases more insulin to lower blood sugar levels.

Insulin lowers blood sugar by converting glucose in the blood into fat and storing it as body fat.

The fat from the food we eat is stored as body fat.

If too much insulin is secreted because of this, it can lead to false hunger.

There are two main forms of false hunger.

The first is false hunger caused by blood sugar levels.

Insulin is said to have the effect of lowering blood sugar.

If the amount of insulin secreted is too high, blood sugar levels drop too much.

There is a desire to eat sweet foods because it is necessary to raise blood sugar levels that have dropped too low.

So, after eating a filling meal, I start to feel the urge to have some sweet snacks as well.

The second is false hunger caused by a lack of energy.

Insulin also works to lower blood sugar levels, but

I mentioned that it stores the fat from food as body fat.

If the amount of insulin secreted is too high, too much fat gets stored as body fat.

In this case, there is no fat in the food that can be used for energy right away.

You will feel a desire to eat more food.

You can use stored body fat, but there is energy loss during the conversion process.

From the body's perspective, it is efficient to use body fat in situations where food cannot be consumed.

So first, you try to send signals of hunger by saying that you want to eat.

So I had a filling meal, but after 3 or 4 hours, I start to feel hungry again.

Usually, these two feelings are experienced simultaneously.

I feel the urge to eat every 3 to 4 hours.

At this time, I crave foods that are refined carbohydrates, which are good for raising blood sugar levels.

So, too much insulin is

The nutrients I consume are stored as body fat, which can lead to obesity.

At the same time, it creates false hunger, leading to eating more food.

I came to the realization that in order to lose weight, I need to suppress insulin secretion as much as possible.

The factor that has the greatest impact on insulin secretion.

There has been talk that a low-carbohydrate diet, which involves eating fewer carbohydrates, is good for dieting.

The problem is not the insulin itself, but rather the excessive amount of insulin.

Insulin is originally designed to be secreted in the necessary amounts according to the food we eat.

The insulin secreted at this time does not create false hunger or make us obese.

So why is too much insulin secreted? It's because of processed foods.

In Part 3 of the video, I explained in detail about refined and unrefined foods.

Unrefined foods have a high nutrient content but are digested and absorbed slowly.

It was said that if digestion and absorption are quick, the nutrient content is low.

So, the amount of nutrients that are digested and absorbed gradually increases and then gradually decreases.

In this case, the secretion of insulin gradually increases and then gradually decreases.

For example, if a total of 100 nutrients come in, they would come in like this: 5, 10, 15, 20, 20, 15, 10, 5.

So, according to the incoming nutrients

Because the amount of insulin is gradually increased and then gradually decreased.

Insulin is secreted only as much as needed, and there is no waste, so it is not a problem.

However, in the case of refined foods, the nutrient content is high, but digestion and absorption occur too quickly.

The amount of nutrients that are digested and absorbed increases explosively and then suddenly decreases.

For example, if 100 units of nutrients enter the body, it would end up being 10, 20, 30, 40, and then it stops.

So, the amount of incoming nutrients is increasing at a very fast rate.

In response to this, the body secretes a large amount of insulin.

However, when the nutrients that were coming in suddenly stop, insulin remains.

So, when a lot of nutrients suddenly come in, insulin is secreted rapidly in large amounts.

It was secreted in excess of the necessary amount.

This will result in a large amount of insulin being left over.

This excess insulin lowers blood sugar more than necessary and stores more of the food's fat as body fat.

This causes false hunger to arise.

In summary, excessive insulin creates false hunger and increases body fat.

It's not because of carbohydrates that it's secreted; it's correct to say that it's due to refined foods.

If you do not eat processed foods, consuming a large amount of carbohydrates is not a problem.

In fact, there are high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets that obtain most of their calories from carbohydrates.

This diet includes a lot of carbohydrates, but it is effective for weight loss.

Even if you eat a lot of carbohydrates, there is a condition that they must be consumed as unrefined foods.

Insulin is secreted as needed, and this does not cause any problems.

Insulin not only stores the fat and glucose from food as body fat, but also...

It also converts glucose into glycogen and stores it in the liver and muscles.

It also plays a role in helping protein to be used for muscle synthesis.

If you reduce insulin secretion with a low-carbohydrate diet,

Due to a lack of glycogen, it is difficult to increase the intensity of exercise.

The synthesis of proteins decreases, which prevents muscles from developing well.

As mentioned in the subcutaneous fat video series, muscle is also necessary to reduce subcutaneous fat.

Simply reducing insulin secretion is not necessarily helpful for dieting.

So the problem was that too much insulin was being secreted.

In that case, we should only normalize this and then stop.

To further reduce the amount of insulin secretion.

A low-carbohydrate diet is not necessarily more helpful for weight loss.

Isn't it enough to follow a low-carb diet and exercise hard?

I am following a low-carb diet, but I am really working hard and struggling with my exercise.

In the next video, I will talk about this question.

There should be two videos on the screen right now. I will make sure that the next video appears on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not the 7th part of the low-carb high-fat series, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
