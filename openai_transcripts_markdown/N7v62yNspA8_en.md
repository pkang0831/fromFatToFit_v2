Many people think that dieting is hard and difficult.

The reason there are many people like this is due to outdated diet information.

In the past, there wasn't enough research on dieting.

So the dieting method was quite extreme.

I thought that I just had to eat less food without understanding the principles of dieting.

I think that in order to lose weight, calorie intake should be low.

There was a widespread belief that one should only eat low-calorie chicken breast or vegetables.

I think that if I add seasonings like salt and sugar to make it taste good, I won't be able to diet.

When eating chicken breast and vegetables, I sometimes had to eat them very blandly without salt or sugar.

Due to insufficient calorie intake, I am always suffering from hunger.

Eating chicken breast and vegetables without salt or sugar was very unappetizing, making it difficult to eat.

A diet like this is naturally difficult and challenging.

However, as time has passed, a lot of research has been conducted on dieting.

It has been confirmed that such diet methods are not effective.

So recently, the methods of dieting have completely changed.

If you understand the principles of dieting, you can enjoy delicious and satisfying meals while still losing weight.

Dieting has become very easy.

I don't know the principles of an easy diet. Where can I find such principles?

That content was discussed in the food classification series and the seasoning series.

Right now, the two series links are going out at the top right.

Let's return to the original story.

I understand the principles of dieting, so the diet meals are tasty and it's not difficult to eat them.

Sometimes, there are times when you don't feel like eating a diet meal or find it bothersome to eat.

So, stopping the diet halfway through or

I do plan to diet, but there are times when I feel stressed from constantly eating different foods.

In this video, I would like to talk about why this is happening.

It's not that the diet food is tasteless or that eating it is difficult, but...

I strangely don't want to follow a diet, or I find it bothersome to stick to a diet.

The reason this phenomenon occurs is due to our eating habits up to now.

The reason for becoming obese is that one eats too much food.

The reason for overeating is that processed foods have increased our appetite.

So, most people who become obese tend to eat a lot of processed foods.

These people do not make any special effort to obtain food.

When I entered the convenience store, I could choose food and pay for it, and then I could eat it right away.

When you enter the restaurant, order your food, and wait, you can enjoy a warm meal.

By placing a delivery order and waiting, I was able to enjoy my meal comfortably.

It's not like they're giving away food for free; you have to pay for everything.

Isn't working to earn that money a form of effort?

Yes, that's right.

However, the effort being referred to here is the action taken just before eating food.

Until now, I could just choose the food I wanted and wait to eat it.

To diet, you need to go through the process of preparing food yourself, and

The preparation process that didn't exist before starting the diet is causing resistance.

It's not like I'm making some extraordinary dish, and it doesn't take a long time either.

Does it make sense to not want to diet just because the preparation process is bothersome?

That makes sense.

If I make it myself and eat it.

You can buy ingredients, prepare them, cook, and then eat.

You need to clean up the kitchen that has become messy during the preparation and cooking process.

You need to wash the kitchen tools and dishes you used.

But if you buy food, you just have to eat it and throw away the trash.

There is a huge difference in the time and effort put in.

In the early stages of starting a diet, the motivation to lose weight is strong.

So I endure a bit of inconvenience and diligently stick to my diet.

However, as time passes, motivation gradually decreases.

When motivation decreases, the process of preparing food feels cumbersome.

Even if you are on an easy diet plan that doesn't make it hard to eat because of this,

You want to eat something other than the diet food.

What I really want is to eat convenient food that I can enjoy without having to put in any effort.

Then what should we do?

You need to consider the process of preparing the food when planning your meals.

If preparing ingredients is too difficult and bothersome,

You can buy pre-prepared ingredients from the start.

If you are not skilled at cooking, try to cook in the simplest way possible.

If it's difficult to season, you can use store-bought sauces.

Store-bought sauces often contain a lot of salt and sugar, so they don't seem good for dieting.

Yes, that's right. It's better for your diet not to eat it than to eat it.

So it's better for me to make the seasoning myself and adjust the amounts of salt and sugar.

The problem is that you can't do that.

Not being able to do that makes the diet taste bland, and since it tastes bad, I don't want to eat the diet.

So rather than eating delivery food,

Even if you use store-bought sauces, the important thing is to make it yourself first.

That will help you lose weight more than ordering takeout.

Even if I'm not losing weight, it's important to develop the habit of cooking and eating for myself.

It's not important to do it perfectly; what's important is to just get it done.

I don't have time to cook, so I'm eating a diet lunch box that I heat up in the microwave.

Since I'm not cooking this myself, is it not good?

If there is no problem with the lunchbox itself, it can be effective for dieting.

The problem comes after the diet is over.

Diet lunch boxes are consumed for the purpose of dieting.

Once I successfully lose weight to my target, I will no longer eat packed lunches.

I have only been eating lunch boxes so far to lose weight.

If you don't eat a lunchbox, you don't know what to eat from now on, right?

I eat the food I used to eat because I don't know what I should eat.

The food I used to eat is what made me obese, and many people experience yo-yo dieting because of it.

So even if you are dieting with a diet lunchbox,

Before you stop eating lunch boxes, you should develop the habit of making and eating foods that won't make you gain weight.

The reason I eat diet lunch boxes is that I don't have the time to prepare my own meals.

What should someone like me do?

The freedom that was absent in a state of obesity will emerge when you start dieting.

A small force is sufficient to move a light object, but...

To move a heavy object, a lot of force is needed.

When body fat increases and obesity occurs, the body becomes heavier.

To move a heavier body, a lot of strength is needed.

Because of this, people who are obese tend to avoid moving around.

Even when you actually move, Dong-jik, you're a bit slow, right?

This is why I'm short on time.

When you go on a diet and your body becomes lighter, it becomes easier to move your body.

When it becomes easier to move your body, you will have more time to spare.

So, even though I need to diet now, I don't have the luxury to follow a meal plan.

After losing weight through dieting, you will have the opportunity to manage your diet.

I will summarize.

I want to try making the pretty food that appears in diet vlogs.

I think it would be effective to follow the diet made by a famous YouTuber exactly as it is.

Since I'm going to eat diet food anyway, I want to make it delicious even if the recipe is a bit complicated.

There are various reasons that make diets complicated and difficult.

If the diet is complicated and difficult, it becomes cumbersome to prepare and eat it.

Unconsciously, I start to lose the desire to stick to my diet.

This can cause you to keep stopping your diet in the middle.

Eating a diet plan isn't difficult or tasteless, but...

If you often feel like you don't want to eat for no reason and have a desire to buy food instead,

Please check if I am following a diet that requires too much effort.

If that's the case, it's a good idea to change your diet to make it as easy and simple as possible.

When you go on a diet, you gain some free time.

If you have some free time, you can take your time and do it in a complicated way then.

I understand what you're saying, but can it really be that simple to lose weight?

It's enough.

Dieting is hard and should be done with effort. That's how you lose weight.

If you don't do it in the most effective way, dieting is meaningless.

You need to let go of these negative thoughts.

You can lose weight easily and simply.

Even if you do one thing that is not helpful for your diet,

If you do two things that help with dieting, you will lose that much weight.

As long as I make an effort in the right direction, the effects of dieting will follow accordingly.

With that, I can go on a diet. It's important to have this mindset.

That is a great help for dieting.

There are actually cases where just changing one's mindset has led to weight loss.

How can just changing my thoughts lead to weight loss?

I talked about it in another video before.

It was something that actually happened in the housekeeper experiment.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have related videos appear on the right.

If you're curious about the experiment where simply changing your mindset led to weight loss, you can click on the video on the right to watch it.
