It is claimed that foods that are large in volume but low in calories are good for dieting.

However, such food can cause the stomach to expand.

It is not good for dieting if the stomach expands.

There is a claim that foods that are large in volume but low in calories are not good for dieting.

So there are opposing arguments.

A comment asked, "What do you think about these two claims?"

Let's talk in detail.

First of all, the term "food that is large in volume but low in calories" is too long.

I will just say it's a food like cabbage.

Cabbage is a typical food that is large in volume but low in calories.

First, the idea that foods like cabbage are good for dieting is

This is a common topic that comes up when following a low-calorie diet.

To follow a low-calorie diet, you need to reduce the amount of food you eat.

If you eat too little, you'll feel hungry, making it difficult to stick to a diet.

So there is a high risk of giving up.

In such situations, foods that are low in calories but high in volume, like cabbage, are ideal.

You can eat a lot and still have low calories.

So it has the effect of helping you not to give up on your diet.

This is why cabbage is said to be helpful for dieting.

So simply put, it's okay to eat a lot because it has low calories.

It is said to be helpful for dieting.

On the contrary, the claim that foods like cabbage are not good for dieting is

I think it's okay to eat a lot because the calories are low.

If you eat a lot, your stomach will stretch.

When the stomach expands, you need to eat a lot to feel satisfied.

If you need to eat a lot of food to feel satisfied, then...

When you have a cheat day, eating too much can interfere with your diet.

After successfully dieting, it is easy to experience a rebound because one tends to eat a lot.

Even if it's low in calories, the argument is that you shouldn't eat a lot.

Does eating a lot of foods like cabbage cause the stomach to stretch?

The stomach can stretch.

However, the stomach does not expand due to volume.

It can increase because the intake of fat has been restricted.

As mentioned earlier, the idea that foods like cabbage are good for dieting is...

This is a common topic that comes up in low-calorie diets.

In a low-calorie diet, the intake of fat is generally restricted.

Fat is high in calories.

However, humans need carbohydrates, fats, and proteins all.

So if any one of these three is restricted,

The desire to eat limited nutrients arises.

Severely restricting carbohydrates makes you crave foods that are high in carbohydrates.

Severely restricting fat makes you crave high-fat foods.

Severely restricting protein makes you crave foods that are high in protein.

In order to actually follow a low-calorie diet, if you limit your intake of fats,

I have a desire to eat greasy foods that are high in fat.

Since I'm on a low-calorie diet, I can't eat greasy foods.

So I'm trying to fill my stomach by eating foods like cabbage.

The problem is that the current demand arises from a lack of fat, which creates a desire.

Eating foods like cabbage to fill your stomach does not satisfy that desire.

And this causes the stomach to expand.

In the past, there was a very interesting experiment on appetite and the stomach on Korean TV.

First, have the experiment participants eat a hearty meal of pork belly and rice.

After that, I took a picture of the top.

It was confirmed that there is only a small space left, marked by the yellow dotted line.

In this situation, the experiment participant is

I said that I was so full that I couldn't eat anything else.

Then, when the experiment participants were shown the cheesecake they usually liked,

Suddenly, my stomach expanded, creating space.

If you look at the empty space marked with a yellow dotted line, it has definitely increased compared to earlier.

And because the stomach has expanded, the participants in the experiment were able to eat more food.

I actually finished eating the cheesecake as well.

So even if the stomach is full,

If you have a craving for different food,

Our bodies adjust to that appetite by expanding the stomach and creating space.

If we apply this to greasy food and cabbage,

Even if you eat a lot of cabbage and fill your stomach,

If there is still a craving for greasy food,

In response to that desire, the upper part will expand.

When the stomach expands, it doesn't mean it's full, so you may feel like eating more.

However, if you eat foods like cabbage here to fill your stomach,

The desire to eat greasy food remains, so the stomach will expand again.

I will summarize.

First of all, foods like cabbage are helpful for dieting.

It is rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals that are good for dieting.

However, from the perspective that it has a large volume but low calories, it is not a good food for dieting.

Because from that perspective, foods that are good for dieting are...

The situation is based on following a low-calorie diet.

A low-calorie diet has many issues in itself.

To follow a low-calorie diet, if you limit your fat intake,

That can cause your stomach to stretch.

If the stomach expands, the amount of food intake will increase.

I start to think that the large amount of food I eat is actually the amount I normally consume.

This can lead me to unknowingly overeat.

This is the problem.

So what should I do?

First, it is important to understand appetite without following a low-calorie diet.

The reason for eating foods like cabbage in the first place is...

I have a strong appetite and want to eat a lot of food.

If you eat a lot, you'll gain weight.

I ate foods like cabbage that are low in calories relative to their volume.

However, it is not normal to want to eat so much food that it leads to obesity in the first place.

What caused the problem with your appetite?

Why there is a problem with appetite.

And you need to understand how to make it normal from there.

And then, I need to find the right portion size for me.

In a moment, two videos will appear on the screen.

On the left, set it up to display a video about appetite.

On the right, I will have a video on how to find the right portion size for me.

You can choose and watch the video that you need from the two videos.
