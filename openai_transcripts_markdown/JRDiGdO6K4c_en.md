In this situation, doing abdominal exercises will help reduce belly fat - Part 3 of the weight loss process.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitle feature.

This is the third video in the weight loss process.

In the first video, I will explain how to identify what type of obesity I have.

We looked into how to distinguish between fake weight loss and real weight loss for each type.

In the second video, I talked about the order in which weight loss occurs.

In this video, I would like to talk about core muscles.

Muscles can contract, shortening in length, and relax, lengthening in length.

Muscles that repeatedly contract and relax with elasticity are in the healthiest state.

On the contrary, if it is fixed in a contracted state or fixed in a relaxed state,

The muscles gradually become weaker and stiffer.

If we take another look at the structure of the ship that was featured in Part 1 of the video,

Visceral fat is located deepest inside, along with the organs.

The muscles of the abdomen, known as the rectus abdominis, cover it.

The abdominal muscles are covered by subcutaneous fat.

The subcutaneous fat is covered by the skin.

When visceral fat increases, it pushes the muscles out of the body.

This will cause the abdominal muscles to stretch out long.

And until the visceral fat is lost, it will remain in this state.

Over time, the abdominal muscles gradually weaken and become stiff in a relaxed state.

Even if I work hard on my diet in this state to reduce visceral fat,

The abdominal muscles are already hardened in a relaxed state.

If you don't do abdominal exercises separately, your abs won't be able to contract properly.

If the abdominal muscles cannot contract, they cannot properly support the internal organs.

Since the abdominal muscles are not properly supporting the internal organs, the organs push out the abdominal muscles, causing the belly to protrude.

Because the muscles cannot support the organs and they are being pushed out.

When I touch my belly, it feels firm.

The fact that it is firm rather than soft is what distinguishes it from subcutaneous fat obesity.

The stomach is firm, but it's not the upper abdomen that's protruding; it's the lower abdomen, which distinguishes it from visceral fat obesity.

I have never had that much visceral fat before.

Why do similar symptoms occur?

The abdominal muscles are continuously fixed in a relaxed state.

If the abdominal muscles become extremely weak,

Similar symptoms can occur in anyone.

When you lower your head, the muscles in the front of the neck contract short, while the muscles in the back of the neck relax long.

If this condition is maintained for a long time, the muscles will weaken and gradually become stiff.

In this case, the head will be slightly tilted forward even during normal times.

The weight of the head causes the balance to collapse.

To maintain balance, the bottom must move in the opposite direction.

So, instead of the head being tilted forward, the back will arch backward.

Instead of the back being arched, the lower abdomen will protrude forward.

This is the turtle neck posture.

Because the lower abdomen is protruding forward,

The abdominal muscles are in a relaxed state.

If this condition persists for a long time, even if there hasn't been much accumulation of visceral fat...

The abdominal muscles can become stiff while in a relaxed state.

In addition, with starvation diets or low-calorie diets, there can be significant muscle loss, leading to a decrease in core strength.

Even in cases where you usually do not pay any attention to your stomach, similar symptoms may occur.

If you want to achieve a belly like this, you need to do abdominal exercises.

They say that doing abdominal exercises doesn't necessarily lead to losing belly fat, right?

Yes, that's right.

However, the belly fat mentioned in that story refers to body fat.

The body fat in the abdomen consists of visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Losing visceral fat is more effective through diet rather than exercise.

While exercising is effective for reducing subcutaneous fat,

It was said that doing full-body exercises is more effective than doing abdominal exercises.

So there's a saying that doing abdominal exercises doesn't actually lead to losing belly fat.

The current situation is not about body fat.

The problem is that my abdominal muscles are weak, so they can't properly support my internal organs.

The cause of the problem is weak abdominal muscles.

Do abdominal exercises to strengthen your abs.

If you properly strengthen your abdominal muscles to support your internal organs,

As much as that, the stomach will go in.

So in this case, doing abdominal exercises will make your stomach flatter.

Depending on the person, it is often much easier to gain weight than to lose body fat.

If you are concerned about a protruding belly, doing abdominal exercises can be helpful.

So if your abdominal muscles are weak, your belly will stick out.

You're saying to do abdominal exercises to build muscle, right?

Is it possible to build muscle while dieting?

Yes, it is possible.

In the next video, we will explore how that is possible.

And I will talk about why there are many reasons why it doesn't work.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 4 of the weight loss process.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
