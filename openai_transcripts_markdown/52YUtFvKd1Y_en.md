Solutions for when you enter starvation mode on a low-calorie diet. Basal metabolic rate part 5.

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the fifth video about basal metabolic rate.

In the previous four videos, we discussed what happens to the body when one is starving or following a low-calorie diet.

The physical condition mentioned at the end of Part 4 of the video is also referred to as "starvation mode" or "hibernation mode."

This response of the body that enters such a mode is sometimes referred to as the hunger response.

In this video, I would like to talk about how to solve this problem.

Since the content continues from the previous video,

It will be easier to understand the content if you watch the videos in order from the beginning.

If you haven't seen the previous video, you can click the link in the top right to watch it.

The response methods vary depending on the situation, which can be broadly categorized into two types.

The first case is when the fasting period is not long.

In this case, as mentioned in the previous video, it is not that the basal metabolic rate has decreased.

If you eat enough unprocessed foods and exercise, you can recover.

I explained in detail about unrefined foods in a video I made earlier.

This is a video titled "[How to Distinguish Between Foods That Make You Gain Weight and Foods That Help You Lose Weight]."

If you are curious about unrefined foods, you can click the link in the upper right to watch the video.

So, will it be resolved without gaining weight?

No, that's not the case.

I talked about it in the video of Part 3.

If you drastically reduce the amount of food you eat,

As the intake of salt and carbohydrates decreases, body water is lost, leading to weight loss.

As the amount of food and waste in the stomach decreases, weight decreases.

This is why there was a phenomenon of rapid weight loss when I was starving or following a low-calorie diet.

On the contrary, if you start eating food, the weight that has decreased will be restored.

You might feel resistance because of the part about gaining weight.

It is normal for my weight to increase.

Just because we sweat in the sauna and lose weight, we don't call the sauna a diet.

It's not body fat that's lost, but body water in the form of sweat, and it returns to normal when you drink water.

Similarly, it was not body fat that was lost, but something else due to eating less food.

It just went back to the way it was originally.

The second is that after losing weight by starving, I am maintaining my weight with a low-calorie diet.

I didn't lose weight by starving myself, but I have been on a very low-calorie diet for a long time.

In this case, even if you try to eat unrefined foods and exercise, it often doesn't go well.

I want to eat unrefined food, but when I do, my stomach feels bloated or uncomfortable.

I want to exercise, but I have no strength in my body, so it's hard to work out.

And things like chocolate, snacks, and ice cream.

The desire for processed foods is very strong, so it's difficult to stick to a diet.

I mentioned in another video that if I eat unrefined foods, my cravings for refined foods decrease.

Even if you eat unrefined foods, the desire for refined foods does not decrease.

Alternatively, eating unrefined foods can sometimes intensify those cravings.

The reason this happens is that the basal metabolic rate decreases, leading to a decline in the function of the digestive system.

Basically, unrefined food refers to coarse food.

Because it is rough and hard to digest, even if you eat a lot, the amount absorbed by the body is small.

It is good for dieting because the amount absorbed by the body is low.

Eating rough food when the digestive system is not functioning well is causing discomfort.

It's not being absorbed well in the body, so there's a lack of energy, which makes it difficult to exercise.

So, the desire to eat foods that are easy to digest and absorb arises.

This is why the craving for refined foods like chocolate, snacks, and ice cream remains strong.

The solution is to prepare unrefined foods in a way that makes them easy to digest and absorb before consuming them.

This is something I talked about in the video on [how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods].

When food is ground, chopped, or crushed, it becomes fattening.

It is because you can easily consume a large amount, and digestion and absorption are quick.

If we interpret this from the perspective of recovery rather than dieting,

It means that it is easy to obtain the nutrients needed for recovery in large amounts, which helps with the recovery process.

Simply put, when you're feeling unwell, eating porridge is more helpful than eating rice.

Are you saying that I should eat refined foods for recovery?

Yes, that's right.

However, I'm not saying to eat refined foods like chocolate, snacks, or ice cream.

It means to grind, chop, or crush unrefined food before eating it.

These two things have a very big difference.

Unrefined foods contain not only carbohydrates, fats, and proteins but also a lot of nutrients such as vitamins and minerals.

These nutrients provide significant help in recovering health.

On the other hand, chocolate, snacks, and ice cream are high in calories, so they can provide energy, but they lack those nutrients.

So it can't help with recovering the body.

If you eat chocolate, snacks, and ice cream, it may not be difficult to move your body right away, but...

Because the body is not able to recover, I have to keep eating that kind of food.

In that case, it would be impossible to diet.

On the other hand, consuming unrefined foods in a softened form is beneficial because it helps the body recover.

If you visit the hospital when your basal metabolic rate has significantly decreased,

Since my digestive system isn't good, I've been advised to eat soft foods.

The soft foods being referred to here are unrefined foods that have been made soft.

If you cook vegetables or meat for a long time or chop and grind them to eat,

Because digestion and absorption become easier, a lot of energy enters the body.

This will reduce the craving for processed foods and give your body more strength.

When you feel stronger, please exercise and consciously increase your activity level.

As physical activity and exercise increase, the energy required by the body also increases.

When the energy required by the body increases, the function of the digestive system naturally improves.

To supply a lot of energy to the body, the digestive system needs to function properly.

And as the level of activity and exercise increases, the functions of other organs also improve.

In this case, the basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate will all recover.

When you feel that your body has somewhat recovered, try eating unrefined foods that are not made soft.

If there are no issues with digestion and absorption, you can start eating unrefined foods from that point on.

I understand that health comes before dieting, but I'm afraid that if I eat like that, I'll gain a lot of weight.

Weight tends to increase quite a bit.

However, it's ambiguous to say that this leads to weight gain.

Because skinny obesity has a low weight but originally has a lot of body fat, it is still considered obesity.

So I was in a slim state, but it's not that I gained weight from eating soft, unrefined foods.

I originally had a lot of body fat due to obesity, but I have been maintaining a low weight by losing muscle and body water.

As the muscles and body water return to normal, you are finding your original weight that was previously obese.

It's ambiguous to say that this will make you gain weight.

Skinny obesity is not being slim; it is originally being obese. You need to clearly recognize this fact.

One of the most common mistakes people make when dieting is obsessing over the numbers on the scale.

As I mentioned in the beauty weight series I created before,

The number on the scale isn't that important.

If you look slim on the outside, then that weight, regardless of how many kilograms it is, is considered a cosmetic weight.

If you look fat on the outside, then that weight is considered fat, regardless of how many kilograms it is.

In reality, skinny fat individuals are underweight but appear to be overweight on the outside.

I keep dieting because I look fat on the outside.

What matters is not the number on the scale, but how I look.

I hope you don't become too obsessed with the numbers on the scale.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have the beauty weight series displayed on the right.
