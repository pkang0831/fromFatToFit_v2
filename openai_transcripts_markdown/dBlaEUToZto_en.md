Foods that are not fattening but are misunderstood as fattening.

Hello, this is pkang.

I recently made a video on how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight.

According to the classification in that video, potatoes are not fattening foods.

However, there was a question about why potatoes, which have a high GI index, are not considered fattening foods.

In this video, I will talk about this question.

When we consume carbohydrates through food,

Carbohydrates are converted into glucose in the body.

This glucose spreads throughout the body via the blood.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is called blood sugar.

When blood sugar rises rapidly and significantly, a large amount of insulin is secreted to lower the blood sugar.

Large amounts of insulin create frequent hunger, leading to increased food intake and an increase in body fat.

It is known that foods that rapidly raise blood sugar levels are one of the causes of obesity.

In the past, glucose was made from carbohydrates.

I thought that foods high in carbohydrates would quickly raise blood sugar levels significantly.

Just like the rice and sweet potatoes that appeared in the previous video.

The carbohydrate content is similar, but I'm looking at foods that raise blood sugar at different rates.

Isn't it true that the carbohydrates in different foods raise blood sugar at different rates?

This question arose.

The GI index is a quantification of the blood sugar changes observed after consuming each food.

To understand the GI index, it is important to know the process of measuring the GI index.

The GI index is measured by observing the changes in blood sugar levels after consuming each food.

I did not eat the same amount of all the food.

For example, if I ate 100g of white rice, I measured after eating 500g of cabbage.

Shouldn't we be eating the same amount? Why did we eat different amounts?

This is because each food has a different carbohydrate content.

In the last video, it was mentioned that there are 30g of carbohydrates in 100g of white rice.

100g of cabbage contains 6g of carbohydrates.

So, if we compare 100g of white rice to 100g of cabbage,

We will compare the carbohydrates in white rice, which has 30g, and cabbage, which has 6g.

It is not possible to make a proper comparison because the amount of carbohydrates is fundamentally different.

To determine which type of carbohydrate raises blood sugar quickly, you need to compare the same amount of carbohydrates.

So if you eat 100g of white rice, you should eat 500g of cabbage.

I measured the carbohydrate content by matching the amount of carbohydrates in white rice, which is 30g, with the 30g of carbohydrates in cabbage.

Since the carbohydrates in the food were measured by comparing them on a 1:1 basis,

Foods with a high GI index are definitely foods that raise blood sugar quickly.

As this became known, foods with a high GI index came to be regarded as fattening foods.

However, just because a food has a high GI index does not mean it will necessarily make you gain weight.

If the GI index is high, blood sugar rises quickly, so why is it not considered food that makes you gain weight?

This is because a rapid increase in blood sugar is different from a significant increase in blood sugar.

Let me give you an example to make it easier to understand.

Let's imagine that there is a glass of water, and we dissolve sugar in this water to create sweetened water.

The level of sweetness is referred to as sweetness.

Sugar is in powder form, so it dissolves quickly in water, which rapidly increases the sweetness of the water.

However, no matter how quickly sugar dissolves in water,

If the amount of sugar added from the beginning is very small, the sweetness of the water does not increase significantly.

If you want to increase the sweetness and make the water much sweeter, you would need to add a lot of sugar.

So, how sweet can water become at most?

The amount of sugar determines the maximum height of this sweetness.

How quickly does the sweetness increase until the maximum height is reached?

The speed at which sugar dissolves in water determines this time.

If the amount of sugar added is small, the maximum sweetness is low, but it quickly reaches that low level of sweetness.

If the amount of sugar added is large, the maximum sweetness is high, and it reaches that high sweetness quickly.

So a high GI means that blood sugar rises quickly.

A high level does not necessarily mean that blood sugar can rise.

In reality, even if the GI index is high, there are foods that only cause a slight increase in blood sugar.

A great example to illustrate this is the comparison between carrots and sweet potatoes.

As mentioned in the last video, the GI index of baked sweet potatoes is around 50 to 60.

For convenience, let's assume the GI index is 60.

The GI index of carrots is 80, which is similar to that of white rice.

In that case, carrots are a food that raises blood sugar more than sweet potatoes do.

Is it a food that makes you gain weight like white rice?

This is strange no matter how you think about it.

The reason for this oddity is due to the carbohydrate content.

The GI index of steamed sweet potatoes is 60, and the carbohydrate content is 30g per 100g.

So, the carbohydrates that raise blood sugar by 60 are present in an amount of 30g.

In reality, the elevated blood sugar reaches 1800. (60 x 30 = 1800)

The GI index of carrots is 80, and the carbohydrate content is 10g per 100g.

The carbohydrate that raises blood sugar by 80 is present in an amount of 10g.

In reality, the rising blood sugar is 800. (80 x 10 = 800)

So the GI index is higher for carrots than for sweet potatoes.

In reality, the increase in blood sugar is higher with sweet potatoes than with carrots.

Just because a food has a high GI index doesn't mean it significantly raises blood sugar levels.

To be a food that significantly raises blood sugar levels.

The GI index should be high, and at the same time, the carbohydrate content should also be high.

The potato mentioned in the question has a high GI index of 90.

The carbohydrate content is about 20g per 100g.

In that case, there are 20g of carbohydrates that raise blood sugar by 90.

In reality, the rising blood sugar level is at 1800, which is similar to the level of sweet potatoes.

So potatoes are not a fattening food.

Even though it's not food that makes you gain weight,

There are foods that are misunderstood as fattening because they have a high GI (glycemic index).

This has led to the recognition that a new indicator is needed to consider the carbohydrate content of food.

So now, we calculate by multiplying the carbohydrate content in a single serving of each food by the GI index.

A new indicator called the GL index has been created.

To summarize,

Foods that have a low GI index and low carbohydrate content are

It is a food that raises blood sugar slowly and to a low level.

Vegetables fall under this category.

Foods that have a high GI index but low carbohydrate content are

The speed at which blood sugar rises is fast, but...

It is a food that has a low maximum height for raising blood sugar.

Carrots, potatoes, and fruits fall into this category.

Foods that have a high carbohydrate content but a low GI index are

The maximum level to which blood sugar can rise is high.

Because the speed at which blood sugar rises is slow, it is food that does not reach that level.

Foods like whole grains such as brown rice fall into this category.

Finally, foods that have a high GI index and also a high carbohydrate content are

The maximum height to which blood sugar can rise is also high.

It's a food that can quickly raise blood sugar levels.

This is food that quickly raises blood sugar levels significantly, and it is food that makes us gain weight.

Such food hardly exists in nature.

Foods that are high in carbohydrates but have a low GI index.

Grinding, pounding, crushing, and cooking at high temperatures to process it in a way that increases the GI index.

Foods that have a high GI index but low carbohydrate content.

Processing to increase the carbohydrate content or

It is processed and made so that you can eat a lot.

Processed foods like this are referred to as refined foods.

Reducing the intake of such processed foods is the most fundamental and essential aspect of dieting.

If you just stick to this, you can lose weight.

Those who are quick-witted may have already noticed, but...

The foods that were mentioned in the video about distinguishing between fattening foods and weight-loss foods are those that are quickly digested and absorbed.

In this video, we are talking about foods with a high GI index.

Processing that facilitates quick digestion and absorption refers to processing that increases the GI index.

In the end, it simply explained the content discussed in the video using the term GI index.

It's saying the same thing.
