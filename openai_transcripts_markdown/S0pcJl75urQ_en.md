Does a person who has gained weight even once have a changed metabolism that makes it easier to gain weight?

Does a person who has gained weight even once have a body that easily gains weight due to a change in their constitution?

A story related to this question has arrived.

Before starting my diet, I gained 10 kg over the course of three years.

After losing 10kg through dieting,

They say they gained 10 kg in 3 months.

From what we've seen so far, it just seems like a yo-yo effect.

However, I didn't even do a low-calorie diet.

Compared to before the diet, the basal metabolic rate is similar.

It is said that there is not much difference in eating habits and lifestyle habits.

Then why is that?

It could be due to the increased muscle mass from gaining weight.

First, let's read the story and then discuss it in detail.

Hello, pkang. I have a question about something I don't understand.

Until my twenties, I was someone who didn't gain weight easily.

As I reached my 30s, I started to gain a little weight.

I gained 10 kg in three years and for the first time in my life, I went on a diet.

It's my first time dieting, but...

I remember hearing that starving diets and low-calorie diets are not good.

I just switched all my meals to diet lunch boxes.

For lunch and dinner, I ate diet lunch boxes.

Even if I want a late-night snack, I eat a diet lunch box.

Even though I wanted to eat snacks, I had a diet lunch box.

Whenever I wanted to eat something, I always ended up having a diet lunchbox.

On days when I ate a lot, I sometimes had six in a day.

I eat whenever I want, so my diet hasn't progressed quickly.

There is a saying that quick diets are likely to lead to yo-yo effects.

I thought it would be better to be slow instead.

It took a long time, but I finally succeeded in losing 10 kg.

I had an InBody measurement done.

Compared to before the diet, my basal metabolic rate has decreased by about 50 kcal.

I thought this was a successful diet.

Since the diet is over,

I stopped eating diet lunch boxes and started eating the foods I used to eat again.

I naturally thought that I would gain weight again if I did this.

However, I gained 10 kg over the past three years.

I will gain about 3 kg in a year.

At that time, I thought I could lose 3 kg again with diet lunch boxes.

However, I gained 10 kg in just three months.

No matter how much I think about it, I just can't understand.

I tend to like things that are regular and quiet.

I don't go out separately unless it's for work.

I rarely meet friends for lunch or drink alcohol at gatherings.

I enjoy watching YouTube or Netflix alone at home.

I spend most of my time like that when I'm not at work.

So after getting a job, there was almost no change in my daily routine.

There isn't much difference in what I eat compared to before I started my diet.

When it takes three years to gain 10 kg while living a nearly similar lifestyle.

Why did I gain 10kg in just three months?

I don't understand why I'm gaining weight so quickly, even though my basal metabolic rate hasn't decreased.

Is it possible that someone who has gained weight even once has their body type changed?

What should I do?

This is the story with such content.

When body fat increases, the body becomes heavier.

Body fat has weight, so that's only natural.

To support and move a heavier body, more strength is needed.

To generate more strength, more muscle mass is needed.

By using the weight of dumbbells and barbells to apply load to the body.

Just like when you overcome that resistance and move dumbbells and barbells, your muscle mass increases.

Putting strain on the body due to increased weight.

When you move your body while overcoming that resistance, your muscle mass increases.

Simply put,

The muscles needed to move a body weighing 50 kg.

When comparing the muscles needed to move a body weighing 60 kg,

Of course, it requires more muscle to move a body that weighs 60 kg.

When you gain weight, it's not just body fat that increases; muscle also increases along with it.

If you measure the body composition of someone who is severely obese due to this,

Even without exercising at all, the muscle mass can be very high.

The problem is that muscles do not easily stretch.

When you exercise, muscle mass increases. You often hear this.

In the early stages of exercise, performance ability increases quite rapidly.

I feel like my body is getting bigger.

There are quite a few people who misunderstand that exercising will quickly lead to an increase in muscle mass.

Increasing muscle mass is more difficult and takes longer than you might think.

The reason why performance ability increases rapidly in the early stages of exercise is

This is because the neuromuscular system has developed, allowing for better utilization of the same amount of muscle.

The reason for feeling like your body is growing larger is

It's because exercise and muscle soreness cause water to accumulate in the muscles, temporarily making them swell.

There is an online community where people who exercise a lot gather.

A frequently asked question in that community is

Showing a photo of a celebrity with a lot of muscles.

The question is how many months it would take to achieve a body like this celebrity's.

The answer that always runs takes not just a few months, but several years.

It's a representative example of how perception of the rate at which muscles grow can differ from reality.

So when you gain weight, it's not just body fat that increases.

In order to support and move a body that is becoming heavier due to body fat, muscle mass also increases.

To increase muscle mass, time is needed, and

This slows down the rate at which you gain weight.

Because I move my body every day, I can't gain body fat to an overwhelming extent.

However, after gaining weight and becoming obese, muscle mass has already increased.

So when body fat starts to increase again, the rate is not suppressed.

This is why you gain weight relatively quickly.

However, when you diet, you also lose muscle.

Yes, that's right.

However, there is something called muscle memory.

When you exercise, muscle mass increases, and when you don't exercise, muscle mass decreases.

However, even if you take a break from exercising and your muscle mass decreases,

Because the changes that occurred as my muscle mass increased remain in my body.

When I started exercising again.

The muscle mass I used to have is increasing rapidly.

This is referred to as muscle memory because my body remembers the muscles.

Because of this muscle memory

When I was obese in the past, the muscle mass I had back then increases rapidly.

Because muscle increases rapidly, body fat also increases quickly.

So, if you have a lot of muscle, do you gain weight easily?

You might think that way after hearing this much.

No.

The reason for gaining weight in the first place is not because of having a lot of muscle.

The reason for gaining weight is due to problems with eating habits and lifestyle.

Using muscles has the effect of preventing weight gain.

When dieting, I intentionally exercise to increase my muscle mass.

Due to poor lifestyle habits, I am unable to properly utilize my muscles.

It's because of the eating habits of frequently and excessively consuming fattening foods that one gains weight.

It's not because of muscle that you gain weight. You shouldn't be mistaken about this.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

When body fat increases, the body becomes heavier.

To support a body that is becoming heavier, more muscles are needed to move.

Since it takes time for muscle mass to increase,

When you first start gaining weight, the rate of weight gain is suppressed.

So, they gain weight relatively slowly.

Second

When muscle mass increases, changes occur in my body.

This change remains even after the muscle mass has decreased.

Even if body fat and muscle mass decrease due to dieting,

I can quickly recover to the muscle mass I originally had, but...

Because of this

When you gain weight for the first time and then gain weight again after dieting.

You can gain weight more quickly.

Third

If I go back to the lifestyle that made me obese just because the diet is over,

Due to the effect of muscle memory, you can gain weight more quickly.

The problem is going back to a lifestyle that leads to obesity in the first place.

It's not a problem with muscle memory.

I can organize it like this.

You mentioned that effectively using muscles can help prevent weight gain.

If that's the case, why do athletes gain weight after retiring?

I previously made a detailed explanation video because the same question came up.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

You said that if I go back to the lifestyle that made me obese, I would gain weight again.

So, does that mean I have to eat a diet plan for my whole life?

If I have to live like that for the rest of my life, I don't think I can go on a diet.

Yes, that's right. No one wants to eat a diet plan for their whole life.

And you don't have to do it that way.

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

When dieting, while exercising

After finishing a diet, if I stop exercising, I tend to gain weight.

What should I do about this?

The problem lies in the diet method, and I also made a video about this.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.
