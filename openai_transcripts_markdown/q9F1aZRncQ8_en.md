The misconception that being underweight is beautiful, even if it harms health - Eating Disorders Part 5

This is the fifth video about eating disorders.

Since the content continues from the first video, it is better to watch them in order from the beginning.

If you haven't watched the video in front, you can click the link in the top right corner and watch it in order.

In this video, I would like to talk about the distorted perception regarding beauty that suggests one must be thin to be considered pretty.

Aiming for too low a weight is not good for your health.

It's a very common saying in dieting.

It is true that being underweight is not good for health.

So that story isn't incorrect.

There is one problem.

The reason not to aim for being underweight is mistakenly thought to be solely for health reasons.

So being underweight is not good for health, but it is good for appearance.

This is how I come to think.

In reality, it is not like that.

Being underweight is quite disadvantageous from a cosmetic perspective.

It's pretty. It's ugly. This varies from person to person, right?

Can we definitively say that being severely underweight is more disadvantageous in terms of beauty?

Yes, it is possible.

It's not about comparing different people; it's about discussing the state of one person.

For example, there are two people, A and B.

Who is more beautiful among these two people? In such questions, different people apply different standards.

Some people feel that A is more beautiful, while others feel that B is more beautiful.

In this case, there is no objective standard.

However, A with makeup and A without makeup.

If it's a story about the changes in the state of the same person,

It can be definitively said that wearing makeup makes one more beautiful.

The very purpose of makeup is to enhance one's beauty.

All the treatments we do for beauty purposes are included here.

The reason for getting a massage is that being free of swelling is more beautiful than having a swollen body.

The reason for skincare is that skin without troubles is beautiful.

The reason for taking care of your hair is that thick and shiny hair is beautiful.

Conversely, if your body tends to swell, you experience skin troubles, and your hair is damaged leading to hair loss, then...

This condition can be objectively described as an unfavorable state for beauty.

As mentioned in the basal metabolic rate series,

If you lose weight by starving yourself or follow a low-calorie diet for an extended period,

The basal metabolic rate will decrease.

Basal metabolic rate refers to the energy used by major organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

If even one of these vital organs does not function properly, life is at risk.

So our bodies try to protect our basal metabolic rate as much as possible.

I tried to protect it that way, but a decrease in basal metabolic rate means that...

This means that there is even a shortage of energy to be used in the major organs.

However, compared to these major organs, hair is not that important.

Just because you don't have hair doesn't mean your life is in immediate danger.

In a situation where there is a lack of energy for the major organs, does our body try to protect our hair?

Of course not.

So, when you go on an extreme diet, hair loss is an inevitable consequence.

And when the functions of the major organs decline, the body itself becomes weaker.

When the body becomes weak, it reacts very sensitively to external stimuli or shocks.

And such reactions can manifest on the skin or as swelling in the body.

When fatigue accumulates significantly or when health issues arise.

The occurrence of skin troubles is very common.

It is quite common for swelling to occur in areas of the body where there is a problem, as fluid accumulates there.

And in the case of swelling, the body becomes swollen, thickening and enlarging.

If you look at it the wrong way, you might misunderstand it as gaining weight.

If you listen to the stories of underweight women who find it easy to gain weight,

If you don't manage it, you can gain 3 to 4 kg in just a few days.

They say that if you manage it again, it will return to its original state.

The rapid increase and decrease in such a short time is due to body water, not body fat.

Your body is too weak, so you are easily developing swelling.

So, my hair is damaged and I'm experiencing hair loss, resulting in thinning hair.

Various troubles occur on the skin.

A condition where the body is swollen due to edema.

Is this condition advantageous for beauty? Upon closer examination, it is clear that it is not.

Therefore, aiming for underweight cannot be considered advantageous for beauty.

However, I have a friend who is underweight but has no health issues and is beautiful.

Yes, that's right. There are people who are underweight but have no issues.

However, as mentioned at the beginning of the video,

It's not about comparing me and my friend, who are such different people.

Some people are born slim and don't gain weight easily, even if they eat a lot.

However, just because there is such a person...

I can't say that I don't need to diet just because I don't gain weight even when I eat a lot.

That friend doesn't gain weight, but I do.

Similarly, there are people who can be underweight without any issues.

However, that doesn't mean that there won't be any problems even if I become underweight.

In most cases, problems arise.

To summarize,

Being severely underweight is not good for health, but it is advantageous for appearance.

It is a perception that many people have, but it is actually incorrect.

When health issues arise, symptoms appear in the body, and those symptoms can be detrimental to beauty.

Health and beauty are not a matter of choosing one over the other.

It is a problem that requires taking both things together.

In this video, I only talked about simple symptoms like hair loss, skin troubles, and swelling.

The biggest problem with being underweight is that it accelerates aging.

In the next video, we will talk about aging caused by anorexia.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not part 6 of the eating disorder series, please wait a few days as we are still in the process of making it.
