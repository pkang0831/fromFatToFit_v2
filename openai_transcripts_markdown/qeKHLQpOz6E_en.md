Hello, this is pkang.

This is the seventh video about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In Part 1 of the video, the types of low-carb, high-fat diets are discussed.

In the second part of the video, a strange low-carb, high-fat diet is created by mixing two different meal plans.

In Part 3 of the video, refined foods and unrefined foods are discussed.

In Part 4 of the video, a balanced diet.

In the fifth video, the amount of food that is good for dieting.

In the sixth video, we talked about low-carbohydrate diets and insulin.

In this video, I will talk about low-carb diets and exercise.

Since the content of the video is all connected,

You need to watch from Part 1 in order to understand the content without any misunderstandings.

For those who haven't watched Part 1, the playlist link is available in the top right corner.

You can click to watch the first part of the video in order.

In the sixth part of the video, if you are consuming unrefined carbohydrates, there is no additional secretion of insulin.

It is a diet that sufficiently reduces carbohydrates, and it was mentioned that there is no need to reduce carbohydrates further from here.

Reducing carbohydrates further does not necessarily lead to a greater weight loss effect.

It was said that it might actually be bad for dieting, and the reason is that you can't exercise properly.

Do I really have to exercise?

The reason we go on a diet is to reduce body fat.

Body fat is mainly divided into two types: visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat that is located inside the abdomen, attached to the organs, rather than on the outer layer of muscle like the abdominal muscles.

When visceral fat increases, it pushes the abdominal muscles outward, causing the belly to swell up like a balloon.

Visceral fat is located right next to the organs, which makes it easily converted into energy.

It is body fat that can be easily reduced with a proper diet.

Subcutaneous fat is the fat that is distributed throughout the body, located between the muscles and the skin.

Because it is located outside of the muscles, the muscles are unable to support it.

It has the characteristic of stretching and swaying according to gravity.

You can think of the sagging belly fat, arm fat, and thigh fat as being caused by subcutaneous fat.

Subcutaneous fat is located far from the internal organs, making it difficult to use as energy.

So it's very difficult to reduce body fat through diet.

So, how can we reduce subcutaneous fat?

Muscles and subcutaneous fat have overlapping functions.

When muscle mass decreases, subcutaneous fat increases, and when muscle mass increases, subcutaneous fat decreases.

So, if you want to reduce body fat, the most effective way is to build muscle through exercise.

This means that it's good to exercise because of this.

I really hate exercising. Do I really have to do it?

The reason you might dislike exercise could be due to a lack of carbohydrates.

Insulin helps store dietary fats and glucose in body fat, but it also does other things.

It also converts glucose into glycogen and stores it in the liver and muscles.

Glycogen is the energy used by muscles, so when glycogen is insufficient, the muscles lack strength.

Due to a lack of strength in the muscles, a reaction of not wanting to exercise occurs.

In reality, the ketogenic diet severely restricts carbohydrates, resulting in a very low amount of glycogen stored in the body.

This can lead to a level of dislike for exercise, to the point where a lack of motivation to move the body may occur.

I am following a ketogenic diet, and I experienced fatigue only in the beginning, but it has since disappeared.

When you enter a room with a strong odor, you initially notice the smell, but after some time, you no longer perceive the odor at all.

When continuously exposed to the same stimulus, we gradually adapt, and once we adapt, we no longer feel the stimulus.

However, this is something I don't notice because I've gotten used to it; the bad smell hasn't actually disappeared.

Similarly, when you first experience lethargy, you feel a lack of strength in your body.

As time passes and you become accustomed to it, you may not even realize that you are experiencing lethargy.

However, the lethargy has not disappeared.

What was the reason you didn't want to exercise before starting a low-carb diet for weight loss?

Before starting the diet, I ate a lot of refined foods, so my body has a lot of glycogen stored.

The reason you don't want to exercise at this time is not due to a lack of glycogen.

The cause is that the weight is too heavy.

To move a heavy body, a lot of energy must be expended.

The body doesn't particularly like to expend this energy.

A reaction to avoid moving the body develops, and this is why one comes to dislike exercise.

In summary, when someone is obese, they may develop a reluctance to exercise because their weight feels too heavy.

When you follow a low-carbohydrate diet, you lose weight, but you become reluctant to exercise due to a lack of glycogen.

In other words, it's not that my original personality is one that dislikes exercising, but rather...

It could be a response of my body depending on my physical condition and diet.

In reality, just to the extent of replacing refined carbohydrates with unrefined carbohydrates.

The person who intentionally does not reduce carbohydrates here is

There is a strong tendency to want to exercise after losing a certain amount of weight.

I am following a low-carb diet, but I am really struggling with exercising.

I'm working hard on my workouts, so my muscles should develop well and I'll lose body fat, right?

Unfortunately, that's not the case.

A person who finds walking exercise not difficult at all will not develop muscles no matter how much they walk.

Because walking exercise is not difficult, there is no need for more muscle.

To build more muscle, a person like this should increase the intensity of their workouts and run.

A person who does not run has not developed the muscles needed for running.

If you run in this situation,

It is because there is a lack of muscles needed for exercise that the muscles develop.

So, I need to do high-intensity exercises that are difficult with the muscles I currently have in order for them to develop.

At this time, glycogen allows my muscles to perform exercises that would be difficult for them to do.

Muscles use glycogen as energy, allowing for intense exercise.

Conversely, if glycogen is insufficient, the muscles lack energy and cannot exert strength.

This means that in situations where the muscles cannot exert strength, it is not possible to perform strenuous exercise.

So, what exercises can be done in a state of low glycogen in the body on a low-carbohydrate diet?

It's difficult because the muscles can't exert strength, but it's a low-intensity exercise that can be done even without muscle strength.

Because it is low-intensity exercise, it does not develop muscles.

So if you are following a low-carb diet, even if you are struggling with exercise,

It's not that muscles develop just because you work out.

Because the muscles do not develop, the subcutaneous fat does not decrease easily either.

So, as mentioned in the sixth video, if you replace refined carbohydrates with unrefined carbohydrates,

Since you have already reduced carbohydrates sufficiently, there is no need to reduce them further here.

Reducing carbohydrates further does not necessarily lead to better weight loss results.

What I've felt while watching the video so far is that it seems like I just need to avoid eating processed foods.

So does that mean I can never eat processed food again?

That's not the case.

In the next video, I will talk about this question.

There should be two videos on the screen right now. Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the low-carb, high-fat part 8 video, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
