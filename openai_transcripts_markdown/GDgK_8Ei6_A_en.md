I received a question in the comments asking, "What do you think about the content of the book 'Confessions of a Vegetarian Doctor'?"

This is the third video answering questions.

In the first video, we discussed the overall content of the book and the parts we agree with as well as those we do not.

In the second video, I discussed the points that are difficult to understand regarding the claim in the book that "humans are starch animals."

The video link is available in the top right corner, so if you're curious, you can click on it to watch.

In this video, we will discuss the claim that starch and carbohydrates do not turn into fat.

I have mentioned in several videos that in order to lose weight, one should reduce the intake of refined carbohydrates.

Refined carbohydrates have issues with energy conversion and blood sugar fluctuations.

This causes false hunger to arise.

Eating unnecessary food due to false hunger leads to obesity as a result.

Regarding energy conversion and blood sugar fluctuations,

In the video, I explained in detail the reasons why your mouth feels bored after eating and why you still feel hungry.

The video link is available in the top right, so if you're curious, you can click to watch it.

However, the book states that no matter how much simple sugars are consumed, only a very small amount of carbohydrates is converted into fat.

An example of conducting an actual experiment is presented.

Even if a slim woman and an overweight woman consume more than 50% of their daily calorie intake from refined sugars,

It is said that only about 4 grams of fat are produced in a day.

I have understood that consuming a lot of refined carbohydrates, like refined sugar, can lead to them being converted into fat, which is a problem.

I'm a bit surprised to hear that it's not the case.

Why did this result come out?

Let's take another look at the experiment details.

It was said that more than 50% of the calories consumed in a day came from refined sugars.

This refined sugar is equivalent to 135g of refined sugar.

Since refined sugar is a carbohydrate, it has 4 kcal of energy per gram.

In that case, 135g of refined sugar would amount to 540 kcal.

In that case, it is assumed that in this experiment, 540 kcal is more than 50% of the daily caloric intake.

In that case, the woman in this experiment has a maximum daily caloric intake of 1080 kcal.

As you all know, this is a low-calorie meal that doesn't even meet the basic metabolic rate.

However, if you eat like this, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins do not easily convert into fat, no matter what you eat.

Because you are eating extremely little.

So, based on this experiment, it is hard to accept the claim that refined sugar "does not turn into fat no matter how much you eat."

Refined sugar does not get stored as fat no matter how much you eat.

There is one more thing that I found difficult to understand in the book along with this content.

This is about satiety.

Let me take a look at the content of the book first.

According to research on the satiety effects of carbohydrates and fats,

Carbohydrates last for a long time, while fats last for a much shorter period.

This is also contrary to the knowledge I have.

Because I know that the feeling of fullness from fat lasts longer than that from carbohydrates.

And there is something called a low-carb, high-fat diet.

It's a diet that reduces carbohydrate intake and increases fat intake.

There are a lot of different types of this diet.

However, it is common that the calories obtained from fat are higher than those from carbohydrates.

A common characteristic of people who follow this diet is that

They say that the feeling of fullness lasts a long time, so they don't feel very hungry.

Then this is also contrary to the content of the book.

Why does this difference occur?

There is only one hypothesis that can explain this difference.

This is a comparison between unrefined foods and refined foods.

Food that has not been milled and still has its husk is called brown rice.

When the husk is removed from this brown rice, it becomes white rice.

When you grind white rice into a powder, it becomes rice flour.

Food has a form that exists in its natural state.

Processed food refers to food that has been altered from its original form, making it easier to digest and absorb.

On the contrary, foods that are closer to their original form and are difficult to digest and absorb are called unrefined foods.

Although they are the same rice, brown rice is said to be good for dieting while white rice is not, and the reason for this is...

This is because brown rice is an unrefined food compared to white rice.

Unrefined foods are difficult to digest and absorb, which is why they have the characteristic of keeping you feeling full for a long time.

Refined foods are quickly digested and absorbed, which means that the feeling of fullness disappears quickly.

So, if we compare unrefined carbohydrates and refined fats,

Because it is unrefined, the feeling of fullness from carbohydrates can last longer.

However, this is not the correct way to make a comparison.

If you want to compare the satiety of carbohydrates and fats, you should compare both in their refined forms.

Alternatively, it should be compared using both foods in their unrefined state.

Are you saying that the experiment was manipulated to produce the intended results regarding satiety?

That is too much of a leap.

It is highly likely that the error occurred during the segmentation process.

From the perspective of someone who frequently watches YouTube,

YouTubers who upload videos can be categorized into a wide variety of types.

A humor YouTuber who uploads entertaining videos  
An information YouTuber who shares informative content

Or there might be beauty YouTubers who teach makeup techniques.

However, for someone who is not familiar with YouTube,

A YouTuber is understood as a person who uploads videos to YouTube, in a broad and general sense.

From this perspective

For those who prefer and advocate for vegetarianism, they are very knowledgeable about it.

So in a vegetarian diet that includes fruits, vegetables, and starchy foods that one is familiar with,

It can be divided into refined vegetarianism and unrefined vegetarianism.

However, people who prefer a vegetarian diet tend to know less about meat consumption.

I can't distinguish between refined meat and unrefined meat well because I don't know much about it.

So, eating meat is understood only as a large concept of carnivorism.

I consider processed meat that has gone through processing and buying and eating fresh meat to be the same type of meat consumption.

In fact, in Chapter 10 of the book, there is a person who is vegetarian but obese.

The cause of obesity is that while one practices vegetarianism, it is not done in an unrefined way, but rather in a refined manner.

Therefore, it is mentioned that one should follow an unrefined plant-based diet.

However, there is no such distinction in meat consumption.

I think it's an error that occurred due to a lack of understanding.

In the discussion about Korean eating habits, it becomes a bit clearer.

Looking at the content of the book,

It is said that Koreans have a habit of finishing their meal with a bowl of rice even after eating meat.

That's it.

Humans are animals that need to eat carbohydrates to feel full.

There is a sentence like this.

After a Korean goes to a meat restaurant and eats meat, they usually have a bowl of rice at the end.

Eating cold noodles is a very common occurrence.

I am also Korean, and when I go to a meat restaurant, I eat this much.

However, the reason Koreans eat like this is

I ate meat, but I'm not eating because I don't feel full.

I feel full and satisfied, but...

I want to eat rice or cold noodles.

Or I eat that way because I've been doing it habitually.

In Korea, people say, "I'm full, but I still want to eat carbs like rice or cold noodles."

Or it can be interpreted as "I can eat more?"

This is a commonly used example when warning about the addictive risks of refined carbohydrates.

The interpretation will change completely.

To summarize,

The claim that carbohydrates provide a longer-lasting feeling of fullness than fats is

I believe it is an error that occurred because of not distinguishing between refined and unrefined foods.

The claim that no matter how much refined carbohydrates you eat, they do not get stored as fat is

In the experiment used as evidence, the daily caloric intake is limited to 1000 kcal.

I find it hard to trust.

Sounds plausible, right?

In the next video, we will discuss the content of Chapter 4, which states that all animal products are bad.
