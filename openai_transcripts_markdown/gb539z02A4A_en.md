Hello, this is pkang.

A question about the stagnation point was posted in the comments, so this is the third video about the stagnation point.

There is a link to the previous video playlist in the top right corner.

If you want to watch the video in front, you can click to see it.

Because the content of the video continues...

It is recommended that those who haven't seen the previous video watch it first.

In Part 1 of the video, we discussed how to distinguish between fake identity and true identity.

In Part 2 of the video, we will discuss homeostasis and yo-yo effects.

And we talked about the causes of plateaus in a low-calorie diet and how to resolve them.

In this video, we will explore the reasons for hitting a plateau on a non-low-calorie diet and discuss solutions.

In the past, the calorie diet theory was considered an absolute theory.

When it comes to a diet plan, it often involves extreme calorie restriction or

Alternatively, there were many low-calorie diets that only allowed for consumption up to the basal metabolic rate.

The problem with this diet is that you always have to endure hunger.

Recently, there has been a growing awareness that the issue is not just about calories, but rather about processed foods.

There are many diets that do not restrict calories.

Since there is no calorie restriction, the issues mentioned in the second part of the video do not arise.

So it seems like there won't be a stagnation period, but in reality, there is a stagnation period.

There are various types of diets, but most experience a plateau for the same reasons.

Let's think about the absorption rate we discussed in the second part of the video once more.

A person cannot absorb 100% of the calories from the food they eat.

It can only absorb a certain percentage.

This absorption rate is not fixed and can change depending on the situation.

In a low-calorie diet where you eat less food and remain in a constant state of hunger,

To obtain as many calories as possible from a small amount of food, the absorption rate increases.

It was said that the absorption rate decreases in situations where a lot of food is consumed.

In that case, among low-carb high-fat diets,

Like a ketogenic diet, you eat enough food and calories, but...

What happens if you eat only a low amount of carbohydrates?

Will the absorption rate of carbohydrates be increased while keeping the absorption rates of other nutrients the same?

It doesn't happen that way because you can't choose only the food you want to digest and absorb. Naturally.

When carbohydrates are insufficient, they need to be replenished.

The absorption rate of the entire food increases.

The ketogenic diet allows for sufficient food and calorie intake.

I am getting enough calories even though the absorption rate is not high.

If the absorption rate increases here, too many calories will be absorbed.

If too many calories are absorbed, body fat will increase.

The increasing body fat like this

When the body fat reduced by a low-carb, high-fat diet reaches a balance,

A plateau is created where body fat neither increases nor decreases.

The cause of this stagnation is that the absorption rate has increased in order to obtain insufficient carbohydrates.

So, by eating carbohydrates and addressing the carbohydrate deficiency, you can break through the plateau.

When you actually experience a plateau while following a ketogenic diet.

There are many cases where eating carbohydrate-rich foods leads to weight loss.

The reason for severely restricting carbohydrates in a ketogenic diet is that

The theory is that eating carbohydrates leads to weight gain, and that avoiding carbohydrates is necessary for weight loss.

The story that eating carbohydrates resolved a plateau and led to weight loss is

It completely clashes with the theory of ketogenic.

So in the ketogenic diet, it is not commonly advised to eat carbohydrates when a plateau occurs.

It is often said that to break through a plateau, you need to restrict carbohydrates more thoroughly.

The problem is that the carbohydrate foods allowed in a ketogenic diet are

Most leafy vegetables have the lowest carbohydrate content.

To further reduce carbohydrate intake, you need to decrease your consumption of leafy vegetables.

Leafy vegetables are high in dietary fiber and have a large volume.

Reducing the intake of leafy vegetables decreases the amount of stool in the body.

When the amount of stool decreases, body weight does decrease by that same amount.

Because the underlying issue of carbohydrate deficiency has not been resolved.

The weight of the stool will result in a loss of body weight, followed by a plateau phase.

And when the plateau comes again, there are no more carbohydrates to cut.

It is said that the reason for a plateau in a ketogenic diet is due to protein.

Because protein stimulates a lot of insulin secretion, eating a lot of protein can also lead to weight gain and a plateau.

You should limit your protein intake.

I also experienced a plateau while doing the ketogenic diet, but I lost more weight by restricting protein.

If what pkang said is correct,

If there is a protein deficiency, shouldn't the absorption rate increase and a plateau phase occur?

Why does weight decrease even when protein intake is restricted?

In the following video, we will discuss why weight loss occurs when protein is restricted in a ketogenic diet.

Now, let's talk about whether protein causes a significant release of insulin.

There should be a video playing on both sides of the screen right now.

Once the next part 4 video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the video for Part 4 of the traffic jam but another video instead,

I am still in the process of making the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

If the video was helpful, please like and subscribe.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
