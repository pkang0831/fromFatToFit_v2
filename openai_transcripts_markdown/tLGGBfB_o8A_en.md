I became the type of person who gains weight if I stop exercising after doing diet workouts.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

Exercise is said to have the effect of preventing weight regain during a diet.

So they say that exercise is essential for properly dieting.

I lost weight while exercising.

If you don't exercise, there are cases where you can become prone to gaining weight.

In such cases, it is quite unfair.

In the past, I was overweight, but...

Even without exercising, I was able to maintain that weight consistently.

Right now, I have to exercise in order to maintain that weight.

So there are quite a few cases where people regret exercising for no reason.

In this video, we will explore why this phenomenon occurs.

And I would like to talk about how to solve it.

First of all, the reason exercise is said to have the effect of preventing weight regain is that

This is because the overall level of activity increases through exercise.

Exercising leads to the development of muscle mass.

As muscle mass develops, exercise performance ability increases.

As your exercise performance ability increases, the same intensity of exercise will become easier.

What is important here is that exercise is ultimately an extension of activity.

For example, walking out of my house to go to a convenience store and

Is there a difference between going out of the house to walk for exercise?

It's just the same. Anyway, it's just walking.

Simply walking as much as needed in daily life is classified as activity.

for the purpose of developing the body

If you take the time to walk even though you don't need to, it is classified as exercise.

This is where it gets important.

If I exercise by walking, the muscles related to walking will develop.

What will my daily life be like?

Walking becomes easier.

And if walking becomes easier, you naturally end up walking a lot.

For example, there is a person who dislikes walking even short distances and always insists on driving.

If this person continues to exercise by walking regularly, walking will no longer be a difficult task.

In that case, you can just walk to nearby places.

Even if you go up a level with the same concept, you might still be someone waiting for the elevator.

If you consistently do stair climbing exercises, you'll likely start using the stairs for at least one floor.

So, when muscles develop through exercise and athletic performance improves,

What used to be exercise has become easier and is now part of everyday activities.

In this case, if we take the body before exercising as the standard, it means that we are continuously exercising in between.

Therefore, you won't gain as much weight as you did in the past.

This is why exercise is said to prevent weight cycling.

So what about people who say they have a body type that gains weight if they don't exercise?

I am someone whose metabolism has decreased, excluding exercise.

Many people go on a diet when

I am trying to reduce the amount of food I eat while also exercising.

This is where the problem arises.

The energy a person consumes in a day is divided into basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate.

Basal metabolic rate refers to the energy consumed by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

The active metabolic rate is the energy expended during activity.

Exercise metabolic rate refers to the energy expended during physical activity.

Often, when people eat less to diet,

It is said that when the energy consumed by the body decreases, it becomes easier to gain weight.

The energy that the body consumes here refers to those three types of metabolic rates.

So, if you diet by eating less food, those three types of metabolism will decrease.

If you try to force yourself to exercise at this time,

Energy needed for exercise  
To secure exercise metabolism.

The basal metabolic rate and the activity metabolic rate will decrease.

From our perspective, we are forcing ourselves to exercise because of the diet.

From the body's perspective, the only reason to force movement in a situation of energy deficiency is for hunting.

The less food there is, the more hunting must be done.

So, how do you plan to secure the energy needed for exercise, even if you reduce other calorie intake?

This leads to a strange phenomenon where the basal metabolic rate and the activity metabolic rate are low, but the exercise metabolic rate remains unchanged.

In this way, the energy obtained from food is being consumed through exercise, which helps maintain the body.

So when you exercise, your weight is maintained.

If you don't exercise, excess energy accumulates and you gain weight.

They say that if you look at this, you will become the type of person who gains weight if you don't exercise.

However, I've heard that if you exercise and increase your muscle mass, your basal metabolic rate also increases?

Yes, that's right. The problem is that my muscle mass is not increasing right now.

There is a saying that even eating and resting are forms of exercise.

For muscles to grow, not only exercise is needed, but also...

This is a story that came about because of the need for nutrition intake and rest.

However, right now I am intentionally eating less food for my diet.

In such situations, even if you exercise, your muscles will not grow properly.

The necessary nutrient intake for growth is not being properly met.

So the problem is that I exercised while eating less.

So, does that mean I need to exercise while eating?

However, no matter how hard you exercise, if you don't manage your diet, you won't lose weight, right?

Yes, that's right.

However, managing your diet does not necessarily mean you have to eat less food.

If you understand the principles of dieting, you can lose weight without eating less food.

Doing so will help prevent the yo-yo effect of exercise.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

On the left, set up a video explaining the reasons why you can lose weight without eating less.

On the right, I will have a video on how to increase the lowered basal metabolic rate and activity metabolic rate.

You can choose and watch the videos that interest you.
