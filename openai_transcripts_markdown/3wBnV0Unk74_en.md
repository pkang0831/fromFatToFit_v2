Three Reasons Why You Shouldn't Rely on Weight While Losing Fat - Body Image Part 1

I am working hard on my diet, but my weight is not decreasing well.

I know I shouldn't starve, but if I eat, my weight increases significantly, so I can't bring myself to eat.

I’ve seen some comments like this, so I’d like to talk about body image.

There are three main indicators to check how well I am doing on my diet.

Weight measured by a scale.

Body fat percentage measured by InBody.

Lastly, there is the "eye body" method to visually check changes in the body.

First, let's talk about the scale and the InBody.

Lastly, let's talk about the body measurement method.

Many people who are on a diet often consider weight as a significant indicator of their success.

In fact, weight is influenced by various factors, so it is not a very good indicator.

Rather, there are many cases where people make wrong choices because they are deceived by their weight.

There are three main reasons why you shouldn't rely on weight.

The first is muscle.

The essence of dieting is to reduce body fat and increase muscle.

However, since muscle increases weight much more than body fat does,

Even if body fat decreases significantly, if muscle increases...

There may be no change in weight, or it may even increase.

I heard that there isn't much difference in weight between muscle and body fat?

Yes, there is such a story.

In the past, there were photos circulating on the internet claiming that muscle is much heavier than body fat, but...

Recently, it has been said that while muscle is heavier than fat, the weight difference is not that significant.

Such photos are spreading on the internet.

Muscle is much heavier than fat.  
No, there is not much difference in weight between fat and muscle.

Because opposing statements are conflicting, it can be confusing to determine what is correct.

If we compare the weight of pure muscle to the weight of body fat, rather than just looking at body weight...

The weight difference between muscle and body fat is not that significant.

However, the impact on weight is completely different.

When the same amount of muscle and the same amount of body fat increase.

The range of weight gain is much larger.

There was a question about this before, so I made a response video.

The video link is currently displayed in the top right corner.

If you're curious about why this is happening, you can click here to see.

So even if body fat decreases, if muscle increases...

There may be no change in weight, or it may even increase.

But isn't it difficult to build muscle?

They say that just because you exercise a bit, your muscles won't grow significantly.

Does it make sense that there is no change in weight even though the muscles are increasing?

Yes, that's right.

The content mentioned earlier is based on the standard of someone who consistently and diligently exercises.

This does not apply to someone who has just started exercising.

However, in this case, due to water retention, your weight may not change or may even increase.

The basic principle of muscle growth through exercise is load and recovery.

When a strong load is applied to the muscles, tiny injuries occur.

As these wounds heal, the muscles grow bigger and stronger.

When a person gets a wound, moisture accumulates in that area.

Exercise creates tiny injuries in the muscles, and during the recovery process, moisture accumulates in the muscles.

This is called the phenomenon of moisture retention.

And since water also has weight, it can lead to an increase in body weight.

So, in the early stages of starting exercise, weight can increase due to water retention.

If you are consistently exercising, it means that your weight may increase due to muscle growth.

The last third is food.

I worked hard on my diet and lost 5 kg, but...

Having a cheat day can sometimes lead to a weight gain of 2 to 3 kg.

Losing weight really takes a long time and is difficult, but gaining it back happens in an instant.

Many people give up on dieting out of frustration.

However, just because your weight has increased, it doesn't mean that it's all body fat.

Body fat doesn't increase quickly or decrease quickly in the first place.

If you eat a lot of food, the amount of stool increases.

When the amount of stool increases, body weight increases by that same weight.

Carbohydrates and salt increase body water.

Naturally, body weight will increase by the amount of weight from the increased body water.

However, the weight that has increased like this will return to its original state in just a few days once I go back to my diet.

There is absolutely no need to feel frustrated or give up on your diet because of this.

There are specific tasks that need to be done at this time.

I made a video about what to do first when you binge eat while on a diet.

The link is at the top right, so you can click on it to view.

In summary, weight is significantly influenced by muscle, body water, and food.

It is not good to determine the success of a diet based on weight gain or loss.

Actually, exercising is making me gain weight? Maybe I shouldn't exercise.

I am working out hard, but my weight isn't decreasing well.

Feeling wronged and giving up on dieting.

I followed a very low-calorie diet and since my weight has decreased,

As if you come to prefer a low-calorie diet.

You can be misled by your weight and end up following a wrong diet.

Don't be deceived by your weight; it's better to be accurate.

Then, is it okay to measure body fat and muscle mass using an InBody instead of a scale?

In the next video, we will learn about InBody.

In the next video, I will talk about body image.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the second part of the body measurement video, then...

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
