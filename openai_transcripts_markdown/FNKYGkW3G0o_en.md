I felt like there wasn't enough when I was eating, so I ate a little more.

After finishing a meal, I feel like my stomach is going to burst because I'm so full. Please tell me why this happens.

I received a story with this kind of content, and I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the content of the story.

Hello, I'm a subscriber of pkang.

I happened to watch pkang's video, and it changed my thoughts about dieting a lot.

I always thought that dieting was hard and difficult, so I would give up quickly every time.

Doing it the way Ronka does makes it definitely less difficult, and I find myself able to keep going.

My taste, which only liked fattening foods, has changed a lot, and I have lost a lot of weight.

Maybe it's because I've lost weight, but I feel less tired and more energetic in the morning.

Recently, I have been bringing a packed lunch to the office.

However, there is something strange.

I pack a portion similar to what I eat at home in my lunchbox.

It feels too much at the company, so I end up leaving.

I feel like I've eaten enough, and then I want to stop eating.

I felt pleasantly full, which was nice.

I realized that this is what Ronka was talking about when he said that appetite has returned to normal.

However, when I have dinner at home after work, I don't feel full even if I eat the same amount as lunch.

I don't feel like I've eaten enough, and I have a desire to eat a bit more.

So I ate the lunchbox that was left at the company.

After finishing the drama I was watching while eating, when I get up to clean up and pick up the dishes...

My stomach feels extremely heavy and it feels like it's going to burst.

At first, I thought I might have been eating a lot unconsciously because I was comfortable at home.

Still, it's strange that I don't feel full, yet suddenly it feels like my stomach is going to burst.

Why is this happening?

This is the story with such content.

Let's talk in detail.

To conclude, the problem is that I watched a drama while eating.

The human body is regulated by signals through hormones.

When you need food, a hormone called ghrelin is released, making you feel hungry.

When you eat enough food, a hormone called leptin is released, which makes you feel full.

However, in certain situations, these signals can be blocked.

For example, in a situation where one is risking their life to fight against a tiger.

If you feel the need to go to the bathroom or feel hungry, you won't be able to concentrate properly.

If you can't concentrate properly, the likelihood of dying will increase.

So in a situation where you are focused, signals that disrupt that concentration are blocked.

Of course, modern humans rarely fight tigers.

In the past, humans who lived by hunting and gathering often had to fight dangerous predators like tigers.

The descendants of humanity who survived at that time are us today.

In situations where we are focused, other signals are blocked.

In fact, when you concentrate on studying in a noisy café, you may not even notice the noise.

When I focus on the game, I sometimes forget to go to the bathroom.

When you focus on a drama while eating, you may not feel full.

This is the problem.

When having a meal at the company, I focus on the food rather than watching a drama.

You feel a proper sense of fullness, so you eat just enough and stop.

When eating while watching a drama at home, I tend to focus on the drama.

Not feeling full properly.

So even though I ate it all, I still feel like it's not enough.

The important part here is that it is not actually lacking.

I ate enough so that I wouldn't feel lacking, but I was so focused on the drama that I didn't really feel full.

If you eat more in this state, it will lead to overeating.

Once the drama viewing is over and my focus on the drama fades,

A blocked signal can be felt.

I feel like my stomach is going to burst because I overate too much.

When eating, if you focus on something other than the food, it becomes a problem, right?

So, does that mean you shouldn't do anything else while eating?

What about having a conversation while eating with friends or family?

That's okay.

Among the human sensory organs, vision holds the largest significance.

Since the drama continuously transitions between scenes, a lot of information keeps coming in through visual means.

In the first place, the content itself is very stimulating in order to immerse the viewers.

So, as I focus more on dramas than on food, it becomes a problem.

Of course, if you focus too much on the conversation during a meal, it can become an issue.

Casual conversations are not a big problem.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

In the first situation of concentration, signals that disrupt that focus are blocked.

If you focus on a drama while having your second meal, it can block the signals of fullness.

Because of this, you may have eaten enough but still not feel full.

If you don't properly feel the third level of fullness, you tend to overeat.

This overeating is a cause of obesity and is not good for dieting.

I can organize it like this.

When having a meal, please try not to engage in other activities.

It is best to focus on the food.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

I used to think that only diet and exercise were important for weight loss.

It's interesting that the environment, like watching a drama while eating, can have an impact.

Is there another video on this topic?

The size of the dish used for food and thoughts about dieting also have an impact.

I used to make videos before.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have the related series available in the top left.

If you're curious, you can click to see it.

Looking at the story, it seems that dieting is tough and difficult, leading to frequent giving up.

It seems that the method of Mr. pkang has made dieting easier.

What is pkang's diet method?

People usually think that the cause of obesity is overeating too much food.

So, many people diet by reducing their food intake.

Even if I feel hungry from reducing my food intake, I try to force myself to endure it.

However, just as overeating is a cause of obesity, there are also underlying reasons for overeating.

My approach is to address the cause of overeating.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right.

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

I understand that when eating, I shouldn't engage in other activities and should focus only on the food.

Isn't it also a problem if you focus on your meal and eat too quickly?

Yes, that's right.

Eating food quickly is not good for dieting either.

It's good to slow down the pace of eating itself.

I also made a video about the speed of eating food.

I will make sure it appears in the bottom left.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
