The reason diet food is often tasteless and solutions to that problem.

Hello, this is pkang.

Diet food and weight-loss food are not tasty.

It's the perception that many people have about diet food.

In the past, I thought that in order to diet, one had to eat less food.

So the biggest problem with dieting was resisting hunger.

Recently, the side effects of starvation diets and low-calorie diets have become widely known.

Rather than eating less food, there is a growing interest in not consuming processed foods.

Processed foods are a cause of obesity.

If you eat unprocessed foods, it means you can eat until you're full without any issues.

However, this time there is the issue that diet food is not tasty.

You can eat until you're full, but you have to eat only tasteless diet food.

Dieting is still something I don't want to do and find difficult.

Many people think they want to finish their diet quickly and eat delicious food.

But why do diet foods taste bad?

And can't we make it delicious and eat it?

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

The taste of food includes various flavors such as salty, sweet, spicy, and sour.

The reason why diet foods are often tasteless is related to the flavors of saltiness and sweetness.

It is commonly believed that diet food should be eaten blandly and with low salt.

One of the causes of obesity has been identified as refined carbohydrates, which rapidly raise blood sugar levels.

There has been a growing awareness that seasonings with a sweetness similar to sugar should not be used.

So when it comes to diet food, it should have no sugar at all and as little salt as possible.

It brings to mind food that has almost no sweetness or saltiness.

For example, there could be chicken breast that has not been seasoned with salt at all.

Such food is obviously very tasteless.

But do we really have to eat diet food like that?

That's not the case.

The reason why there is a perception that eating as little salt as possible is good for dieting is...

It is due to the relationship between sodium and body water.

Sodium must maintain a constant concentration in the body.

Eating a lot of sodium increases the amount of body water.

If you consume less sodium, the amount of body fluid will decrease.

If you consume a lot of sodium, the amount of body water will increase.

The weight increases by the amount of the increased body water.

The body becomes thicker in proportion to the increased volume of body water.

Conversely, if you consume less sodium, the amount of body fluid will decrease.

The weight decreases by the amount of reduced moisture.

The body becomes thinner in proportion to the reduced volume of water.

So, if you eat less sodium, your weight and body size will decrease.

This speed has the characteristic of being much faster than reducing body fat.

People who are on a diet all want to lose weight quickly.

It has been said that limiting sodium intake can lead to faster weight loss.

Because of this, there is a perception that when dieting, one should either avoid salt or use it sparingly.

However, what is decreasing like this is body water, not body fat.

Of course, if you consume too much sodium, your body may retain more water than necessary.

We need to reduce sodium intake to an appropriate level to decrease unnecessary body water.

It is not meaningful to excessively restrict sodium and reduce body fluid more than necessary.

The weight that quickly decreases by restricting sodium can quickly return when sodium is consumed again.

In fact, a person who has been on a strict low-sodium diet can gain 2 to 3 kg in just one day after eating salty food.

Most of the weight gained at this time is water.

Unless sodium is restricted for a lifetime, it will eventually recover at some point.

Restricting sodium beyond what is necessary is meaningless.

Moreover, if sodium is restricted too much, it can inhibit the burning of body fat.

Fat is an organic compound formed by the combination of fatty acids and glycerol.

Fatty acids and glycerol both contain carbon.

When carbon combines with oxygen, it becomes carbon dioxide and water.

Because this process is similar to the combustion process of fire.

The reduction of body fat is referred to as fat burning or fat combustion.

So when body fat is burned, water is produced inside the body.

When sodium intake is restricted, if water is produced in the body, the concentration of sodium decreases.

The body tries to prevent the formation of water.

So the burning of body fat is suppressed.

Then, conversely, if you eat salty food, your body should retain more water.

Does body fat decrease more effectively?

In theory, that's true, but eating too much salt can also hinder your diet.

When the salt intake was increased for Russian astronauts.

There was an experiment observing physical changes.

I conducted an experiment based on the expectation that consuming a lot of salt would require a significant amount of body water, leading to severe thirst.

However, most of the participants in the experiment felt thirst more than the need for water.

He expressed a desire to eat more due to hunger.

There are two main reasons for this.

The first point is that, as explained earlier, water is produced during the process of burning body fat.

To increase body water, burn body fat.

The desire for food has increased in order to restore burned body fat.

When you burn calories through exercise, you need to replenish those calories.

You can think of it as a similar concept to an increase in appetite.

The second reason is due to the moisture in the food.

People often think that to obtain hydration, one must drink water, but

A person can obtain moisture not just from water, but also from food.

Food inherently contains moisture.

So, when you need hydration, you may sometimes feel hunger instead of thirst.

As this becomes known, a person can confuse thirst with hunger.

It has been said that mistaking thirst for hunger and eating food can lead to obesity.

When you feel hungry, drink a glass of water to check if it's not thirst.

When dieting, you should drink plenty of water.

These diet tips were popular for a while.

Recently, it is recommended to consume a lot of unrefined carbohydrates such as fruits and vegetables.

Unrefined carbohydrates contain a lot of moisture.

If you are following a diet that includes a lot of unrefined carbohydrates, it is not necessarily required to drink more water.

Anyway, when you eat salty food, there is a phenomenon where your appetite increases.

If you eat a lot of food due to increased appetite, it will obviously not be good for your diet.

So eating salty food can also hinder your diet.

I will summarize.

Limiting salt intake leads to a loss of body water, resulting in a decrease in weight and body size.

There is a growing perception that limiting salt intake is beneficial for dieting.

So when I eat diet food, I try to eat it as bland as possible without adding salt.

Food that is not properly seasoned is very tasteless.

This is the reason why there is a perception that diet food is tasteless.

Continuing to eat this kind of food is naturally difficult for anyone.

However, it is true that eating too much salt is not good for dieting.

Restricting salt too much can also inhibit fat burning.

There is no need to eat food if you have to go through the trouble of doing it.

You can season it to your liking and enjoy it deliciously.

In the next video, we will talk about sugar.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not a new release,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
