The reason the effects of bulletproof coffee are gradually diminishing - Bulletproof Coffee Part 3

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video about bulletproof coffee.

In part 1 of the video, we discuss whether simply drinking bulletproof coffee has a weight loss effect.

In the second part of the video, we talked about why the effects of drinking bulletproof coffee vary from person to person.

In this video, we will discuss the effects of bulletproof coffee on satiety and appetite reduction.

Let's explore the reasons why drinking bulletproof coffee for a long time may lead to a decrease in its effects.

First, a diet method that involves eating filling foods to control appetite and reduce meal portions is

The method was already widely used even before bulletproof coffee became known.

Konjac provides a feeling of fullness, which helps reduce meal portions.

Foods rich in dietary fiber create a feeling of fullness, which helps reduce meal portions.

If you're someone interested in dieting, you've probably heard this story at least once.

Foods rich in konjac or dietary fiber do not have a weight loss effect on their own, but

By filling up on such foods and reducing meal portions, a weight loss effect can occur.

The overall concept is similar to bulletproof coffee.

However, there is one major difference between that kind of food and bulletproof coffee.

Foods rich in konjac or dietary fiber are low in calories but have a large volume.

Bulletproof coffee is a liquid coffee, so its volume is small, but it has a high calorie content.

Depending on the recipe, there can be some variation, but a cup of bulletproof coffee typically contains about 300 to 400 calories.

There are these differences, but why do both have the same effect of providing a feeling of fullness?

This is because there are two types of satiety in humans.

There are two types of satiety that a person feels: volumetric satiety and caloric satiety.

The feeling of fullness from volume is the sense of satiety that comes from the volume of food consumed filling the stomach.

The feeling of fullness from calories comes from the energy supplied to the body by the calories in the food consumed.

Foods rich in konjac and dietary fiber are low in calories but have a large volume.

While it may not satisfy calorie fullness, it has the effect of providing fullness in terms of volume.

On the contrary, bulletproof coffee does not fill the volume of fullness, but it does have the effect of satisfying calorie fullness.

Both volumetric satiety and caloric satiety need to be satisfied together for the feeling of fullness to last the longest.

Even if only one side is satisfied, a feeling of fullness can occur.

The problem is that this method has the disadvantage of becoming less effective over time.

In the case of a diet that fills the feeling of fullness with foods rich in konjac or dietary fiber,

In the early stages of dieting, there are no issues with appetite, but...

As the dieting period extends, the desire to eat something arises even when I feel full.

The desire to eat greasy food becomes increasingly strong.

Since the feeling of fullness from calories is not satisfied, the desire to fill it becomes stronger.

The method of satisfying calorie fullness with foods that are low in volume but high in calories is the same.

Initially, there are no issues with appetite, but over time, problems gradually arise.

The desire to fill the volume of fullness is becoming stronger.

To fill the volume, the amount of food consumed is gradually increasing or

Between meals, my stomach feels full, but I sometimes have a desire to eat snacks.

In a ketogenic diet, vegetables and fruits are restricted in order to limit carbohydrates.

Vegetables and fruits are low in calories while being large in volume.

Limiting the intake of vegetables and fruits makes it difficult to achieve a feeling of fullness in terms of volume.

So, to fill the lacking volume, I end up eating more and more meat.

I have had meals with sufficient calories, but I sometimes find myself looking for snacks in between meals because I'm feeling a bit bored.

Because of this, many people who follow a ketogenic diet consume specialized snacks known as keto snacks.

And when following a ketogenic diet, a person who used to eat close to 1kg of meat a day...

After stopping the ketogenic diet and increasing my vegetable intake, I feel that eating less than 500g of meat a day is a lot.

Eating meat and vegetables together has also increased the desire for snacks.

Bulletproof coffee also has a high calorie content, but because it is a small volume drink, it is similar to ketogenic.

In the beginning, the feeling of fullness and the appetite-suppressing effect that lasted for a long time gradually weaken.

One interesting point is that the recipe for bulletproof coffee is gradually changing to prevent this phenomenon.

The original recipe for bulletproof coffee was to mix coffee, butter, and coconut oil.

From here, a question arises.

If the goal is to increase the calories by adding fat to coffee,

You can just use butter instead of oil.

If you need to add oil, there are other oils besides coconut oil.

Why is it necessary to specify coconut oil? This raises some questions.

It is said that coconut oil is good for health, but there are plenty of other oils that are also healthy.

But why is it specifically mentioned that coconut oil should be added?

Coconut oil contains a large amount of medium-chain fatty acids that are not found in other oils.

Coconut oil is characterized by its medium-chain fatty acids, which allow it to be digested and absorbed more quickly than other oils.

So the goal is to quickly digest and absorb in order to satisfy the feeling of fullness from calories.

Recently, there has been a lot of talk about needing to use MCT oil instead of coconut oil.

Recipes that include MCT oil are becoming popular.

MCT oil is an oil that has been extracted and refined from medium-chain fatty acids.

It is an oil that has been processed to be digested and absorbed faster than coconut oil.

So, because it is absorbed and digested faster than other oils, using coconut oil was the basic recipe.

Recipes are changing to use MCT oil, which is absorbed and digested faster than coconut oil.

The goal is to fill up on calories more quickly to prevent a lack of fullness from volume.

When I actually made bulletproof coffee using a recipe that includes coconut oil.

A person who has experienced a gradual decrease in the effects of satiety and appetite reduction.

After switching from coconut oil to MCT oil, I have also experienced an increase in effectiveness again.

When you increase the amount of butter or oil added, the calories in bulletproof coffee also increase.

You may also experience the effects that have diminished being restored again.

The problem is that the cause of this phenomenon is a lack of fullness in volume.

Increasing the total calorie intake or using more refined oils is a temporary measure, not a solution.

Over time, the effects will diminish again.

At that time, we can't use more processed oil and increase the calories further.

If you are drinking bulletproof coffee and its effects are diminishing, consider using a more refined oil or increasing the calories before doing so.

Please check if the volume of the food in my current diet is too insufficient.
