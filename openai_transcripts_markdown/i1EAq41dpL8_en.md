The reason why you don't lose weight even if you exercise like crazy (feat. SBS Special) - Calories Part 2

This is the second video about calories.

This is the second video, but the reason I started this series is because of the content of this video.

I made a video in the past stating that the calories burned through exercise have little impact on dieting.

There were quite a few comments expressing disagreement with that video.

It seems that a similar topic was covered in a documentary broadcast by SBS.

So when I watched my video, I couldn't believe it.

There was a comment saying that they were surprised to see the same content on the broadcast.

And you asked a question about this part from what was mentioned on the broadcast.

He analyzed the daily calorie consumption of the Hadza people in Tanzania.

A traditional tribe that lives a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, running more than 10 kilometers every day.

The level of physical activity was tremendous.

I compared it to Westerners who spend most of their time sitting.

However, there was no difference in daily calorie consumption between the Tanzanian tribes and Westerners.

This is the result of using the most accurate state-of-the-art method, the dual-labeling technique.

To summarize the question, it goes like this.

When you walk for an hour, you burn approximately 300 calories.

If you live a life of hunting and gathering all day, you would likely have more physical activity than just walking for 4 hours.

In that case, the Haja tribe is consuming 1,200 more calories than Westerners.

How can the total calories consumed in a day be the same?

Is the basal metabolic rate of a person with a low metabolism less than 1000 calories?

If the basal metabolic rate is less than 1000 calories,

With such a high level of activity, why is the basal metabolic rate decreasing?

You asked an interesting question, didn't you?

I will talk about why that is.

In the last video, it was mentioned that the human body changes to adapt to the environment.

If you reduce the amount of food you eat, it creates a calorie deficit environment.

In order to adapt to that environment, the calories consumed by the body decrease.

Similarly, when the environment becomes conducive to exercise,

To adapt to that environment, I change to exercise more efficiently.

When you first start exercising, the movements feel very awkward because you're not used to them.

You have to pay attention to how to position your hands and how to position your feet, one by one.

As you continue to exercise and become accustomed to it, your movements gradually become smoother.

You don't have to worry about what to do with your hands and feet; they move on their own.

This is about changing to be able to exercise more efficiently.

In this way, the calories burned through exercise will gradually decrease.

If you can exercise efficiently, why is the number of calories burned decreasing?

There are two machines, A and B.

When doing the same work, machine A requires 10 units of fuel.

Machine B requires 20 units of fuel.

Machine A is more efficient than machine B.

Because it requires less fuel to do the same work.

So, when we say that efficiency improves, it means that...

It means that you can do more work with a small amount of energy.

In that case, saying that exercise efficiency improves means that the energy required for that exercise decreases.

In other words, it means that the calories burned during the same exercise decrease.

The reason the effects diminish when you keep repeating the same exercise is because of this.

So, the Haja tribe, which repeats a lifestyle of hunting and gathering,

Because hunting and gathering are done repeatedly, efficiency gradually improves.

So the energy consumed per activity is low.

In the case of Westerners, on the contrary, their low level of activity leads to poor efficiency.

So the energy consumed per activity is high.

Just like 2 x 5 and 5 x 2 are the same.

Although the energy consumed per activity is low, the Hajazok has a high level of activity.

Westerners have a high energy expenditure per activity, but they have a low level of physical activity.

The daily metabolic rate can be similar.

This is the reason why the daily metabolic rate of the Haja tribe is similar to that of Westerners.

So what about people who have successfully lost weight by walking or running 10km without any dietary changes?

Even if you burn calories through exercise, it's not necessarily effective for dieting, right?

Weight loss does not solely depend on the calories burned through exercise, but...

Exercising itself does have a weight loss effect.

In the next video, I will talk about this.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the calorie part 3 video,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
