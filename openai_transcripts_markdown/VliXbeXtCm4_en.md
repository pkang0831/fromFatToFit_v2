Reasons Why You’re Not Losing Weight Despite Diligently Following a Diet and Exercising - Upper Body Obesity Part 4

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the fourth video about upper body obesity.

The topic of this video is upper body obesity and diet.

When it comes to a typical diet plan, it often involves reducing the amount of food consumed.

In the last video, I mentioned that exercise is more effective than diet for losing upper body fat.

Many people often think that exercising and reducing the amount of food they eat would be more effective.

However, that's not actually the case.

In this video, I would like to talk about why that is.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it is better to watch them in order.

If you haven't watched the previous video, you can click the link in the top right corner and watch them in order.

I am eating less food for my diet and making time to exercise separately, but...

Aside from that time, there are quite a few people who just lie still.

In the case of such individuals, even if they diligently follow a diet and exercise, they often find that upper body obesity does not improve.

Because the overall level of activity is low.

In the last video, I mentioned that knit exercises are effective in addressing upper body obesity.

NEAT exercise is a type of activity that increases your overall movement.

In order to address upper body obesity, it is necessary to increase physical activity.

Excluding exercise time, just lying still is considered low activity.

Then, of course, upper body obesity will not be resolved.

Wasn't it supposed to work out on its own if you just did some exercise?

NEAT exercise is a type of activity aimed at increasing your overall activity level when you already have a basic amount of movement.

It is not effective in situations where the time spent lying down has increased and basic activity levels have decreased.

Also, when you are lying down, your body relaxes, so it's not easy to do knit exercises.

Spending more time lying down also means that the time spent doing non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) is reduced.

Wearing nice clothes can make you look attractive to the opposite sex. That's true.

However, in a situation where you are dirty and smell because you haven't washed, it doesn't matter what clothes you wear.

First, start with the most basic step of washing thoroughly.

It seems like what you wear afterward is important.

It makes sense to exercise after having a basic level of activity.

I know I need to move, but if I only focus on dieting, I feel weak.

The reason this happens may be due to issues with the diet.

The energy a person uses in a day is referred to as their daily metabolic rate.

The daily energy expenditure is the sum of the basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate.

Basal metabolic rate refers to the energy used by major organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

The active metabolic rate refers to the energy used in everyday activities excluding exercise.

Exercise metabolism refers to the energy used during physical activity.

If you reduce the amount of food you eat, the energy that enters your body will decrease.

Our bodies try to balance by reducing the energy we consume.

However, in the case of basal metabolic rate, it is the energy used by major organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

It is not easy to carelessly lower your basal metabolic rate.

So I'm trying to lower my basal metabolic rate or my exercise metabolic rate.

If you don't want to exercise and find it difficult, but you are forcing yourself to continue for the sake of dieting, then...

The exercise metabolism is likely still being consumed.

Ultimately, the basal metabolic rate decreases first.

Because of this, you become annoyed and feel weak, leading to a reluctance to move.

This is the most common problem that can arise from a low-calorie diet that restricts fat intake.

To lose weight, limit the intake of carbohydrates or

Because some people eat less food overall, they may also end up consuming less protein.

In such cases, the effects of exercise may not be clearly visible.

Carbohydrates are the source of glycogen, which is the energy used during exercise.

If carbohydrate intake is restricted too severely, it can hinder proper exercise performance.

If you can't exercise properly, muscle growth won't happen.

And because protein is the building material for muscles,

If protein intake is insufficient, muscle growth will not occur even with exercise.

As I mentioned in the previous videos,

You need to increase muscle mass through exercise to correct poor posture.

You need to increase your muscle mass through exercise so that you can do knit exercises for a long time.

Restricting carbohydrates and proteins is not good either.

I am limiting carbohydrates, but it doesn't affect my ability to exercise.

There is a problem, but it is highly likely that you are not aware of it.

When you exercise, you become accustomed to the exercise itself, and your muscles grow.

The exercise that was difficult at first gradually becomes easier.

When exercise becomes easier, it means that the intensity of the exercise has decreased.

When the intensity of exercise decreases, the effectiveness of the exercise diminishes.

So once you get used to exercising, you need to increase the intensity of your workouts.

This is what is commonly referred to as progressive overload.

However, there are people who exercise with the goal of dieting but always repeat the same intensity of workouts.

For example, doing 100 bodyweight squats every day consistently for several months.

When watching workout videos on YouTube and following along, there are times when you end up doing the same video for several months.

If you exercise like this, the effects of the exercise will gradually decrease.

I also plan to increase the intensity once exercising becomes easier, but what can I do if it's still difficult after several months?

The reason for this could be a deficiency in carbohydrates or proteins.

When there is a lack of carbohydrates, the body lacks energy, which means you cannot increase the intensity of your workouts.

If there is a lack of protein, muscle growth does not occur, which means you cannot increase the intensity of your workouts.

If this continues, even though I am consistently exercising, I will always be at a standstill, and in that case, upper body obesity will not be resolved.

I know that carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are all important, but...

Can you lose weight even if you eat all that food?

Yes, I'm leaving.

I talked about how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight in a video.

It's not important to eat less food; what's important is what kind of food you eat.

If you eat unprocessed foods, you can lose weight without necessarily eating less.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have a video on the right that explains how to distinguish between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight.
