How to Avoid Failing at Dieting - Thought Diet Part 4

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the fourth video about thoughts on dieting.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about the illusions that make it difficult to control portion sizes.

In the second part of the video, we talked about the perception of calories that create hunger.

In part 3 of the video, I talked about an experiment where just changing your mindset can lead to weight loss.

In this video, I will talk about a method to ensure you never fail at dieting.

A method to never fail at dieting.

It seems like there might be some grand method, but that's not the case.

You just need to keep going without giving up.

If you don't give up on your diet and keep going, you will eventually succeed.

Is there anyone who doesn't know that??

Yes, that's right. It's a very obvious statement that everyone knows.

But why do people want to diet yet either not start at all or...

Will I give up in the middle of my diet?

It is because of the psychology of compensation that an obsession with dieting arises.

The term "compensation psychology" refers to the mindset of expecting rewards in relation to one's efforts.

For example, a person who thinks that the cause of obesity is eating too much food

If you make an effort to eat less, you can expect to lose weight as a reward.

In fact, overeating is indeed a cause of obesity.

If you don't eat too much food, it's true that you can lose weight.

The problem is that most people who are dieting are not satisfied with just losing weight.

You want the method that works the strongest and fastest for dieting.

And when this mindset and the desire for reward combine, it can lead to extreme thoughts.

The process of falling into extreme thoughts can be simply expressed like this.

If you make an effort to eat less, you will be rewarded with weight loss.

If you make more effort to eat less, dieting will be more successful with greater rewards.

If you make the greatest effort to not eat at all, the biggest reward will be that you will lose weight the most effectively.

Such thoughts can lead to the belief that one cannot diet without eating insufficiently or feeling hungry.

However, it is, of course, not the most effective diet method to eat as little food as possible.

You can diet without eating less food while feeling hungry.

Rather, diets that involve starving like that or low-calorie diets are

It hinders weight loss by lowering the basal metabolic rate.

I've heard that even on a low-calorie diet, the basal metabolic rate doesn't decrease. Is that true?

There was a question about that part before, so I answered it in a series of videos.

For those who are curious about the details, there is a link in the upper right corner.

You can click to see it.

So, because of a sense of compensation.

There is a misconception that making diet rules stricter will lead to better results in dieting.

This misunderstanding does not only apply to the amount of food consumed or calories.

For example, consuming too many carbohydrates is a cause of obesity.

In a low-carb, high-fat diet, it is necessary to reduce the amount of carbohydrates consumed.

By reinforcing the rule that carbohydrates should be reduced,

The less carbohydrates you eat, the better the diet works.

Eating carbohydrates prevents weight loss.

There are people who have such thoughts.

Eating too frequently is a cause of obesity.

In intermittent fasting, it is important to have fasting periods.

By strengthening the fasting time rules, the longer the fasting period, the better the diet results.

If you break the 16-hour fasting period by even a second, the diet won't work.

There are also people who have this kind of thought.

However, that's not actually the case.

Oh? Really? Why is that?

The reasons for that were discussed in detail in each series.

The link is currently being displayed at the top right.

For those who are curious about the details, you can click to see them.

Simply put, just because it's hard and difficult to diet doesn't mean that the effects of dieting are greater.

You don't have to do everything perfectly to be able to diet.

Rather, this kind of thinking makes dieting difficult and challenging.

I feel like it will be difficult, and I lack the confidence to do it perfectly, which makes it hard for me to even start a diet.

It becomes a reason for giving up in the middle because it is difficult and challenging.

You don't have to do a diet perfectly, and it doesn't have to be hard or difficult.

First, if I have improved my existing eating habits and lifestyle and started exercising,

Even if it's small, there is a dieting effect.

However, isn't it impossible to become completely slim with just a weak diet effect?

Yes, that's right.

However, once you get used to it, you can increase the difficulty.

Exercise helps you become accustomed to it and build stamina. This allows you to engage in more challenging workouts.

When you lose weight and your body feels lighter, it becomes easier to change the habit of not wanting to move.

When you improve your eating habits, your taste changes, making it easier to change your diet.

I will find the most effective diet method and follow that method to lose weight.

I will do the most perfect diet.

Let go of these thoughts. It's okay to take a break if it's hard, and it's okay to be weak.

The most important thing is to keep going steadily without giving up in the middle.

Rather than giving up on dieting and having a period where you don't do it after going through various trials and errors,

Starting with a light diet and gradually increasing the difficulty while maintaining consistency is important.

In fact, it can lead to faster weight loss.

Let go of the pressure and start with what you can do.

Just doing that is enough.
