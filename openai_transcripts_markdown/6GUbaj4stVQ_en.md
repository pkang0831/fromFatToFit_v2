How to Lose Age-Related Weight and Become Younger - Age-Related Weight Loss Part 5

All videos have subtitles.

If you can't see the subtitles, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the fifth video about dieting for age-related weight gain.

In the last video, we talked about growth hormones, which are the cause of age-related weight gain.

The decrease in growth hormone is one of the causes of age-related weight gain.

Increasing the secretion of growth hormone helps in losing age-related weight.

To increase the secretion of growth hormone,

We need to understand the role of growth hormone and increase its necessity.

The role of growth hormone is to promote cell division and inhibit cell death, thereby increasing the overall number of cells.

We discussed methods to promote cell division in Part 4 of the video.

In this video, I would like to talk about ways to inhibit cell death.

But isn't it bad to inhibit cell death?

You mentioned that as cells are created and time passes, they age and cause problems.

The process by which such aging cells are eliminated is called cell death.

If you suppress that, it seems like there will be more aging cells, which could be bad for health...

Yes, that's right.

As time passes, aging cells will arise.

The increase in aging cells is naturally not good for health.

So we need to eliminate aging cells, but it's strange that we are inhibiting the cell death that does that job.

What appears here is autophagy.

Autophagy is a quite well-known phenomenon in Korea.

There are many ways to introduce methods for staying young and not aging.

Why is autophagy introduced in that way?

This is because it actually has a similar effect.

The human body is made up entirely of cells.

As this cell is created and time passes, impurities accumulate, leading to problems with its function.

Cells that have problems like this are called senescent cells.

To maintain a healthy state in our bodies, we need to reduce the number of these aging cells.

There are two main ways to reduce the number of aging cells.

The first is cell death and cell division, and the second is autophagy.

Cell death and cell division are simple.

Eliminate aging cells through cell death and fill the space by dividing new cells.

The problem is that this process consumes the number of cell divisions.

Human DNA contains something called telomeres.

Telomeres have the characteristic of gradually shortening with each cell division.

If this telomere becomes too short, the cell will no longer be able to divide.

So, humans cannot undergo cell division indefinitely; there is a set limit to the number of times it can occur.

What represents that number is called a telomere.

If all the cell division counts are exhausted, new cells can no longer be produced.

In that case, we have to continue using aging cells that have functional issues.

This will cause problems with the overall functioning of the body and lead to health issues.

The increase of aging cells in the body is referred to as aging. It is said that one is getting older.

So, in order to prevent aging, we need to use these telomeres as sparingly as possible.

What makes this possible is autophagy.

Autophagy refers to the process by which aging cells consume themselves and recycle their components to become healthy cells again.

Are you recycling aging cells to create new cells?

No, it's not about creating new cells.

Creating new cells is called cell division.

Um... You can think of it as building remodeling.

Remodeling is not about tearing down an old building and constructing a new one.

The building remains as it is while the interior is being repaired and improved.

The same goes for autophagy.

The cells themselves remain unchanged.

Inside the cell, it eats itself and recycles to become a healthy cell again.

So, aging cells do change into healthy cells, but...

Because it does not undergo cell division, it does not consume telomeres.

In the beginning of the video, it was mentioned that autophagy is famous for how to rejuvenate and not age.

The reason is that it does not consume telomeres.

Even if a person has already aged, they cannot undergo cell division due to a lack of telomeres.

When autophagy is activated, it can transform aging cells into healthy cells.

When aging cells transform into healthy cells, it rejuvenates the body.

And those who are still young and have some leeway in their telomeres

When autophagy is activated, it can help preserve telomeres.

The more you conserve your telomeres, the later aging occurs, so it can be called a way to not age.

Returning to the original story.

When growth hormone levels decrease, it leads to weight gain associated with aging.

To prevent gaining weight as you age or to lose age-related weight, it is necessary to increase the secretion of growth hormones.

One of the functions of growth hormone is to inhibit cell death.

To increase the secretion of growth hormone, it is necessary to inhibit cell death.

However, does suppressing the cell death that eliminates aging cells pose any health issues?

The answer to that problem is autophagy.

Autophagy can suppress cell death and transform aging cells into healthy cells.

So, what should we do to activate autophagy?

You can reduce stress, engage in various exercises and activities, and control your meal portions.

It has been known that preserving telomeres is a way to prevent aging.

I wondered what kind of lifestyle would activate autophagy and help preserve telomeres.

We conducted a study on thousands of people to investigate the length of telomeres and their lifestyle habits.

It turned out that there were two commonalities among people with well-preserved telomeres.

The first is that I was in an environment with less stress, and the second is that I engaged in various activities and exercises.

Even if you manage to exercise somehow... isn't there no way to deal with stress?

Just because I don't want to be stressed doesn't mean I can avoid stress.

Yes, that's right.

However, there is good stress and bad stress.

The problem is not stress itself, but rather bad stress.

Many people believe that stress is the root of all illnesses and that it is inherently bad.

However, not all stress is bad.

There is good stress and there is bad stress.

A typical example of good stress is exercise.

Exercise is an action that places a strong load on my body, and during this process, our bodies experience stress.

If stress is not necessarily good, then exercise shouldn't be good either, but that's not the case.

Putting stress on the body through exercise is considered good stress.

You can achieve good results here.

And this applies directly to autophagy as well.

In fact, it has been said that people with well-preserved telomeres have in common that they engage in various exercises and activities.

So, good stress activates autophagy and helps preserve telomeres.

It means that bad stress is not like that.

How do you distinguish between good stress and bad stress?

Chronic stress, which is characterized by prolonged exposure to stress, is harmful stress.

I received questions about stress in the past, so I created a series of videos on stress.

The third video discusses the perception of stress and chronic stress.

Stress is often said to be the root of all ailments. It is said that experiencing stress is not good for health.

It's a very negative perception.

The stress itself is not the problem; it's the negative perception that is the issue.

In fact, when we look at the effects of stress on the body, there are quite a few positive effects as well.

However, the perception that stress is bad prevents these positive effects.

There has also been an experiment to check whether the effects vary depending on the perception of stress.

Divide the experiment participants into two groups.

One group was shown a video that explains stress in a positive way.

After showing a video that poorly explains stress to another group,

Both groups were exposed to stressful situations, and afterwards, we observed the changes in their bodies.

The group that watched a video explaining stress positively experienced beneficial effects from stress.

The group that watched a video describing stress negatively did not experience any positive effects from stress.

Depending on how you perceive stress.

It means that you can achieve good effects from stress, or you may not be able to.

So the problem is not stress itself, but the negative perception of stress that is the issue.

If you want to alleviate negative perceptions of stress and achieve positive effects,

The video link is available in the top right corner.

You can click to watch the video.

To activate autophagy in the early part of the video,

You were advised to reduce stress, exercise, and control your food intake.

Lastly, I need to talk about meal quantity and autophagy.

The video has become too long, so I will wrap it up here.

In the next video, I will continue to talk about meal quantity and autophagy.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 6 of the weight loss series, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
