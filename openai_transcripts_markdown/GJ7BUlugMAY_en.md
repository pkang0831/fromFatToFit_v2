Is exercise bad for dieting because it puts stress on the body? - Stress Part 2

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video about stress.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about the principle of gaining weight when under stress.

In this video, we will explore whether stress from exercise hinders weight loss.

The content continues from the first part of the video.

If you haven't watched Part 1 of the video, it's best to click the link in the top right and watch it first.

First, exercise itself puts stress on the body. This is true.

The purpose of exercise in the first place is to put a load on the body to enhance physical abilities.

Exercise at a low intensity that does not put stress on the body has no significance as a workout.

So when you exercise, your body experiences stress, and since stress is not good for dieting...

There have been claims that not exercising is good for dieting.

And while exercise is not necessarily good for dieting,

You need to build muscle through exercise to increase your metabolism and prevent weight regain.

There was also the argument that exercise is necessary.

The first argument is that exercise itself is not beneficial for dieting.

The second argument is that exercise is necessary for dieting, but

The claim is based on the premise that stress caused by exercise is not good for dieting.

But isn't stress from exercise actually bad for dieting?

To put it simply, that's not the case.

In part 1 of the video, it is mentioned that cortisol is released in stressful situations.

Cortisol has the effect of raising blood sugar levels.

If blood sugar levels remain high, inflammation occurs in the walls of the blood vessels.

Insulin is secreted to lower blood sugar levels.

You mentioned that this insulin has a negative effect on dieting.

However, this is only a discussion in the context of not exercising.

The situation changes when it comes to exercising.

When you exercise, the glucose in your blood is used as energy.

When glucose in the blood is used for energy, the numbers decrease, resulting in lower blood sugar levels.

When blood sugar levels drop like this, insulin that lowers blood sugar is not secreted.

Then it won't have a negative impact on the diet, right?

Cortisol not only raises blood sugar levels, but also

It also has the characteristic of increasing appetite, leading to eating more food, and storing that as body fat.

Yes, that's right.

However, in the context of exercising, it becomes a way to replenish the energy expended during the workout.

It does not have a negative impact on dieting.

I'm trying to lose weight by burning body fat through exercise, but if I replenish it, isn't that counterproductive?

Unfortunately, the calories burned through exercise do not have a direct impact on dieting.

Of course, it is effective in the short term, but...

If you exercise consistently, your body adapts and replenishes the calories burned through exercise.

You can think of a low-calorie diet as reducing your meal portions to lower your calorie intake.

In the initial phase of the diet, the reduction in calorie intake leads to a decrease in body fat.

As time passes, the body's metabolism decreases.

Since the intake calories are reduced, it's about reducing the consumption calories to maintain balance.

Even in situations where calorie consumption increases due to exercise, there is a response to try to maintain this balance.

When you burn a lot of calories through exercise, your appetite tends to increase.

It's a response to try to replenish the calories burned through exercise with food.

If you don't eat, you can also save calories in activities other than exercise.

In reality, exercising often leads to an increased feeling of hunger, which can result in a significant increase in meal portions.

Among those who combine a low-calorie diet with exercise,

There are quite a few people who show signs of lethargy and prefer to lie still, except for the time they spend exercising.

If you stop a low-calorie diet because of this, it’s like gaining weight.

If you stop exercising, you will gain weight.

So, the calories burned through exercise do not have a direct impact on dieting in the first place.

Even if increased appetite due to cortisol is supplemented, it doesn't negatively affect the diet, right?

So, is exercise not necessary for dieting?

No, that's not the case.

The impact of calories burned through exercise is minimal. However, exercise itself is necessary for dieting.

However, this content is not related to stress and is something that was covered in a previous video about exercise calories.

I will just let it go.

For those who are curious about this part, the link to the exercise calorie video is available in the top right corner.

You can click and take a look.

Returning to the original story.

The final factor by which cortisol negatively affects dieting is muscle loss.

Cortisol retrieves glucose from various parts of the body to raise blood sugar levels.

Some of them break down muscle to obtain it. This process leads to muscle loss.

Dieting ideally involves reducing body fat and increasing muscle mass.

Muscle loss is obviously not good for dieting.

However, the muscles that are broken down at this time do not just break down any muscle.

Muscles that are perceived as unnecessary due to low usage are broken down.

When you place a strong load on your entire body through exercise, it makes the muscles recognize that they are needed.

It will have the effect of preventing muscle loss caused by cortisol.

I will summarize.

Stress has a negative impact on dieting. This is true.

Exercising puts stress on the body. This is indeed true.

However, the phenomena caused by stress from exercise can be resolved through the exercise itself.

Exercise does not negatively affect dieting.

I understand that the stress caused by exercise is resolved by exercise itself, so it isn't a problem.

What should I do about the stress I experience in daily life, rather than from exercise?

I can't exercise every time I feel stressed. Does that mean I'll gain weight each time?

In the next video, I will talk about this question.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the Stress Part 3 video, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
