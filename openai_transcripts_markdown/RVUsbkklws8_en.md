This is a video responding to a question that was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content.

I would like to know the criteria for low-carbohydrate and high-carbohydrate diets.

First, let me explain a bit about the question.

Eating too many carbohydrates can cause problems, and eating too few can also lead to issues.

The problem that arises from overeating is obesity.

If you focus your meals on refined carbohydrates, your carbohydrate intake can become excessive.

As a result, there is a tendency to become obese.

The problems that arise from eating too little are

In the past, a question was raised, "What side effects are there from eating fewer carbohydrates?" So, I created a response video.

The video link is at the top right, so you can click on it to watch.

After you watch this video completely,

So, what is the standard for a high-carb diet in terms of how many carbohydrates are consumed?

You asked what the standard is for low carbohydrate intake, meaning how little carbohydrates should be consumed.

I will talk about that criterion.

Usually, when this question is asked, it is about how many grams to eat more than or less than.

Many people want to have g defined precisely like this.

It is difficult to determine the exact g.

Because the amount of carbohydrates needed varies from person to person.

Carbohydrates are primarily used in our body as glucose in the brain and glycogen in the liver and muscles.

If you use your brain a lot, the glucose consumption is high or

People with a high amount of muscle mass, activity level, and exercise volume tend to use a lot of glycogen.

The amount of carbohydrates needed is naturally high.

On the contrary, for those who are not like that, the amount of carbohydrates needed is small.

And even if it's the same person, not someone else.

As you exercise and increase your muscle mass and workout intensity, the amount of carbohydrates you need will increase.

Conversely, if you take a break from exercise or lower the intensity, the amount of carbohydrates needed will decrease.

So it's impossible to set a specific number and eat accordingly.

You need to adjust what you eat based on how your body responds.

First, the criteria for low carbohydrates.

How can I confirm that my body is lacking carbohydrates? What symptoms should I look for?

I mentioned that there are symptoms that appear when you eat insufficient carbohydrates.

If the symptoms shown in that video appear, it means that there is a lack of carbohydrates.

Headache, irritability, dizziness, lethargy, fatigue, body aches, constipation, muscle loss, frequent urination, thirst, bad breath.

You need to eat an amount that does not cause these symptoms to appear.

If I am consuming a lot of unrefined carbohydrates and experiencing those symptoms, what should I do?

Unrefined carbohydrates like fruits and vegetables have a low carbohydrate content.

Even if you eat until you're full, the amount of carbohydrates that enters your body is small.

So, it is a very good food that helps with dieting for the average person.

However, if I exercise really hard and have a lot of exercise volume and muscle mass, then...

Because the body requires a lot of carbohydrates.

Such a person may not receive the necessary carbohydrates for their body, no matter how much unrefined carbohydrates they consume.

In this case, what you should do is...

You should consume a certain amount of refined carbohydrates.

It's not that you should avoid all unrefined carbohydrates and eat only refined carbohydrates.

Eat unrefined carbohydrates as much as you want.

The carbohydrates needed for exercise are small in volume, high in carbohydrate content, and quickly digestible and absorbable.

You can think of it as consuming refined carbohydrates.

Among those who actually exercise, some try to muster up energy before working out.

There are cases where drinks containing refined sugar or carbohydrate boosters are consumed.

The important thing here is to be careful not to eat too much.

No matter how hard you exercise,

If you eat more carbohydrates than you can burn through exercise, you may become obese.

What amount does "too much" refer to?

We know the symptoms that arise from consuming a lot of refined carbohydrates.

You can take it until the symptoms appear.

The most representative symptom is false hunger.

Even though I've had a sufficient amount of food, I feel like eating something because I'm bored.

Or if the interval between hunger is too short,

It means that you are eating too many refined carbohydrates.

In this case, you should reduce your intake of refined carbohydrates.

I will summarize.

The amount of carbohydrate intake varies for each person based on their individual needs.

Even if it's the same person, it can vary depending on their lifestyle patterns, exercise levels, activity levels, and muscle mass.

It is not possible to determine an exact number in grams.

The reactions that occur in our body when there is a lack of carbohydrates.

And since we know two reactions that occur in our body when there is too much carbohydrates,

If you provide a point where these two symptoms do not occur,

This is the appropriate amount of carbohydrates for my body.

So, the appropriate amount of carbohydrates for my body is not something that someone else can tell me.

My body is telling me something, so you need to observe your body's reactions and have a conversation with it.

Sounds plausible, right?
