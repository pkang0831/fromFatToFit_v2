What do you think about the content of the book "Confessions of a Vegetarian Doctor"? A question has come up asking this.

This is the fourth video answering that question.

In the first video, I summarized the overall content of the book and the parts I agree with and disagree with.

In the second video, the claim is made that humans, as described in the book, are starch-eating animals that do not consume meat and only eat starchy foods and vegetables.

I summarized the reasons why it is difficult to accept that argument.

In the third video, it is mentioned that carbohydrates from the book do not turn into fat no matter how much you eat.

Regarding the claim that carbohydrates provide a longer feeling of fullness than fats.

I had also summarized the reasons why this claim is difficult to accept.

If you're curious about the content of the previous video, you can click the video link in the top right corner to watch it.

In this video, we will explore the claim from Chapter 4 of the book that animal-based foods are toxic.

The book describes protein, fat, and cholesterol, which are abundant in animal products, as poisons.

However, protein and fat are known to be essential macronutrients along with carbohydrates.

In the case of cholesterol, it is a component that forms cell membranes.

It is an essential component for our body because it is a raw material for various hormones.

I understand about protein and fat, but isn't cholesterol a bad thing?

It is true that cholesterol accumulated in the body can cause diseases, so it is considered bad.

However, the cholesterol in food is not the problem.

Even if a person does not consume any cholesterol at all,

The liver produces and uses 2,000 to 3,000 mg of cholesterol every day.

And the production volume is not fixed.

When cholesterol is consumed through food, the liver reduces its production to balance the levels.

Then, for the cholesterol I consume to cause problems in my body,

This means that you need to eat more than the cholesterol your body produces in a day.

Even if you eat as much as your body produces.

By reducing the production volume to adjust the concentration, excessive intake does not occur.

However, the cholesterol from food is not absorbed 100% by the body.

Because the body produces a lot of cholesterol.

Realistically, consuming a quantity of cholesterol from food that would harm health is

It is practically impossible.

As this fact became known, in 2015, the United States and Japan removed the limit of 300mg of cholesterol intake per day.

As it became known in Korea, eggs, which were representative of foods high in cholesterol,

It was quite a commotion when they said they were exonerated after 40 years.

Then why does cholesterol accumulate in the body?

The most direct cause is obesity due to processed foods.

Cholesterol is only found in animals, so there is no cholesterol at all in plants.

Therefore, vegetarians who only eat plant-based foods do not consume any cholesterol at all.

However, if you look at the content of Chapter 10 of the book,

There is a person who is a vegetarian but is obese.

This person has high cholesterol levels.

In the book, it discusses the causes of becoming obese while being a vegetarian.

It is said that this is because they followed a vegetarian diet with refined foods.

So, the cholesterol that accumulates in the body is

It's not the cholesterol in vegetarian or meat-based foods that is the problem.

Processed food is the cause.

Too much of anything is not good.

Animal products contain a lot of protein, fat, and cholesterol.

Isn't it that something becomes a poison when the nutritional balance is off?

It is true that too much of anything is not good.

It is also true that animal-based foods are high in protein, fat, and cholesterol, but they do not provide a balanced nutrition.

However, if we call animal products poison because of this, then...

Since too much of anything is not good, it means that excessive carbohydrates and dietary fiber are also not beneficial.

Vegetables and fruits are foods that contain "only" carbohydrates and dietary fiber, which do not provide a balanced nutrition.

In this case, plant-based foods also become toxic.

In the first place, no food contains all nutrients evenly.

There is always a lot of specific nutrients.

So, the idea is that eating a variety of foods is good for your health.

The book states that consuming too much protein, fat, and cholesterol can lead to illness.

Isn't that what we call poison?

The book states that consuming a lot of protein can cause odors in the body and lead to the excretion of calcium.

It is said that one can develop osteoporosis and gallstones.

Eating a lot of fat can lead to obesity and may increase the risk of cancer.

Eating a lot of cholesterol is said to be a cause of heart disease and stroke.

I mentioned in front of the video that there is no correlation between dietary cholesterol and the cholesterol that accumulates in the body, but...

First of all, the content of the book is as follows.

However, the diseases that occur from excessive intake are

It's not just protein, fat, and cholesterol.

All nutrients are like that.

Choose any nutrient that comes to your mind right now.

Try searching for "overconsumption" on the internet.

Carbohydrates, dietary fiber, vitamins, calcium, potassium, magnesium, zinc.

The text states that consuming too much of any nutrient can lead to death or illness.

Even excessive water intake can lead to water intoxication symptoms and can be fatal.

And among the topics that became a big issue in Korea,

Brown rice contains a component called phytic acid.

Excessive intake of phytic acid can lead to various diseases.

Therefore, there has been a claim that brown rice is a poison that slowly kills people, and it should never be eaten.

This became a very big issue.

If you consume excessive amounts of protein, fat, and cholesterol, you will develop diseases, which is what the author of the book "Poison" states.

Do you agree with the claim that excessive consumption of brown rice can lead to disease, implying that brown rice is toxic?

I will not do it.

The problem is excessive intake; brown rice is not poison, I would say.

It is the same.

The problem is excessive intake. Protein, fat, and cholesterol are not poisons.

I will summarize.

Excessive intake of any nutrient can cause health problems.

All foods are in a state of nutritional imbalance, containing specific nutrients in high amounts.

Therefore, if one does not claim that all food and all nutrients existing on Earth are poisons,

Excessive intake may lead to health issues.

It is food that contains too much of a specific nutrient.

Claiming that protein, fat, cholesterol, and animal products are poisons for these reasons is

It's hard to understand.

Sounds plausible, right?
