Hello, this is pkang.

In this video, I would like to talk about intermittent fasting.

There was a question about intermittent fasting in the comments before, so I wanted to share some related videos.

I made about two videos.

However, in the case of the videos made at that time,

Since I explain a lot in one video,

There have been reactions indicating that the video is long and the content is complex, making it difficult to understand.

Many people misunderstand the content.

So in this series, we will base it on the comments that appeared in that video.

I will explain each one in detail.

To briefly explain intermittent fasting,

Modern people eat too often and too much, and because of this, various health problems are arising.

It is advisable to have a fasting period where you intentionally do not eat food.

This is the simplest way to understand it.

When understanding it this simply, one only becomes aware of the necessity of fasting time.

If you only understand the necessity of fasting time without knowing other aspects, various problems can arise.

So, in order to properly understand intermittent fasting,

There is a certain amount of food that is considered abundant, and there is a certain amount of food that is considered insufficient.

Why do people eat so often and so much? We need further understanding of this aspect.

All living beings, including humans, have a signaling system that indicates the amount of food they need.

When you need food, you feel hunger, and when you don't need food, you feel fullness.

Unless living organisms are designed to become obese themselves

It is normal not to become obese when eating according to this signal.

There is a signaling system called satiety to inform us about the amount of food that won't lead to obesity.

However, in the case of humans, if they eat whatever they want when they are hungry,

There is an increasing problem of obesity.

So we make efforts to diet and plan our meals, right?

So, is it that humans are inherently designed to become obese?

This is not necessarily the case.

Because all living organisms evolve in a way that is advantageous for their survival.

In the case of obesity, the heavy body itself reduces activity levels.

Having a lot of body fat can be a threat to your health.

Well, then humans are not designed to become obese.

Why do we become increasingly obese when we eat according to our hunger?

This is because there are entities that confuse the signals of human hunger.

The foods that we can easily eat are mostly made through processing.

Food that has deviated from its original form through processing is called refined food.

For example, when brown rice is processed by removing the husk, it becomes white rice.

Here, brown rice refers to unrefined food that is closer to the original form of the food.

White rice can be thought of as a refined food that has strayed from its original form.

Refined foods have the characteristic of being very easily digested and absorbed.

Among refined foods, refined carbohydrates have the greatest impact on hunger signals.

When carbohydrates enter the human body,

It is converted into glucose and spreads throughout the body via the bloodstream.

When consuming refined carbohydrates that are high in content and quickly digested and absorbed,

The amount of glucose in the blood increases explosively.

In this case, the concentration of glucose in the blood, known as blood sugar, increases.

If high blood sugar levels persist, there is a problem of inflammation occurring in the blood vessel walls.

The hormone called insulin is secreted to lower blood sugar levels.

Insulin converts glucose into fat, storing it as body fat to lower blood sugar levels.

At the same time, it stores the fat from the food we eat as body fat.

This is where the problem starts.

The reason we eat food is to obtain energy from it and use that energy.

However, the carbohydrates and fats from the food we just ate have been stored as body fat due to insulin.

I don't have any energy to use right now.

Since I don't have any energy to use right now, my body is sending signals that it needs food.

That makes it feel like hunger.

So even after eating a lot, you start to feel hungry again after about 3 or 4 hours.

Because of this, even if we have breakfast at 7 to 8 in the morning,

When it becomes noon, I start to feel hungry again and crave lunch.

Even if I have lunch between 12 and 1, I feel hungry again by 5, so I want to have dinner.

Even if I have dinner around 6 to 7 PM, I still feel hungry by 11 PM.

Should I have a late-night snack? That's what I'm thinking.

Even if you say that eating late-night snacks is not good and you don't eat them, don't you usually have three meals a day like that?

Is that a large amount of food that people usually eat?

In modern times, rice is the staple food in the East, while flour is the staple food in the West.

White rice and flour are both high in carbohydrate content and are refined carbohydrates that are quickly digested and absorbed.

So the food we are consuming through stocks is refined carbohydrates.

This creates false hunger, and everyone is feeling false hunger.

Feeling hungry and eating every 3 to 4 hours is

It was made to seem like something very obvious, as if it were a normal situation.

This kind of regular meal itself involves eating food too often and in large quantities.

Since I eat too often and too much, my digestive system is being overworked.

The food you eat is refined carbohydrates that quickly raise blood sugar levels.

Blood sugar levels rise quickly and then fall repeatedly.

There is confusion in the body's hormonal metabolism, including insulin, leading to various health problems, including obesity.

This is the cause of obesity and the reason why the global population of obese individuals is increasing.

So, depending on how you address this cause, the methods of dieting will vary.

So, in what ways are diet methods categorized?

First of all, regardless of the type of diet method, it fundamentally includes reducing the intake of refined foods.

This is the cause of obesity, so we start by reducing this.

You need to reduce the intake of snacks, bread, cakes, and rice cakes made with sugar, white rice, and flour.

If you are going to eat meat, you should eat fresh meat rather than processed meats like sausages or ham that are made through processing.

Dried fruits, fruit juices, and vegetable juices made through processing are better than

You should eat fresh fruits and vegetables.

This is fundamentally included in all diets.

The diet plan changes depending on what conditions you add here.

So, if the condition of restricting calories is added in a situation where one is eating unrefined foods,

Limiting the intake of relatively high-calorie fats results in a low-calorie diet.

The chicken breast salad that we commonly know is an example of this.

And if you eat unprocessed foods, there will be no false hunger.

You don't have to restrict calories; you can eat fat. This will result in a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In a low-carb, high-fat diet, carbohydrate intake must be extremely restricted.

If these conditions are added, it becomes ketogenic.

If you go in the direction of eating unrefined foods, you should avoid consuming animal products.

It becomes a vegetarian diet.

Based on the additional conditions within it, it is divided into natural plant-based, fruit-based, and brown rice vegetarian diets.

It's the same with intermittent fasting.

In the case of intermittent fasting, it involves having a fasting period.

Reduce the intake of processed foods.

Through this, you can reduce the frequency of feeling false hunger.

Even if you feel false hunger, you should tell yourself that you shouldn't eat because it's fasting time.

It encourages you to endure.

This is the fundamental reason why it is said that one should have fasting periods in intermittent fasting.

Those who understand this content and apply it to their intermittent fasting find that intermittent fasting is not difficult.

However, without knowing this information,

For those who believe that simply fasting for 16 hours is enough,

Keeping the fasting hours is very difficult.

Even if you force yourself to stick to fasting hours, there are many cases where it has no effect on dieting.

So in the next video, I will discuss why some people say that intermittent fasting is easy to stick to and

I will talk about whether people who find it difficult to stick to intermittent fasting are divided into different groups.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure to have it appear on the right video.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of intermittent fasting,

I am still in the process of making the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

If you found this video helpful, please subscribe and like it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
