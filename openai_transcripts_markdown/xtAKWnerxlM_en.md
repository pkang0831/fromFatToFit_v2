The topic of this video is about the most common mistakes made when following a low-carb, high-fat diet.

I have repeated this many times in other videos as well.

There may be people who are watching my video for the first time.

Let me talk about the part that people most often misunderstand.

The term "low-carb high-fat diet" refers to a very broad concept of a diet.

Inside, there are diets like Atkins, Paleo, Ketosis, and Ketogenic.

This diet consists of entirely different meal plans.

Just as Korean, Japanese, and Chinese fall under the broad category of language.

Both Korean and Japanese are included in the category of languages, but just as Korean and Japanese are different from each other.

It can be referred to as a low-carb, high-fat diet.

The Atkins diet and the Paleo diet are different.

The Paleo diet, ketogenic diet, ketones, and ketosis diet are different from each other.

I emphasized in another video that you should be able to distinguish this diet.

If you can distinguish it, you can move on.

In the case of those who cannot distinguish.

Among the videos I created earlier, there is one titled "Understanding the Low-Carb High-Fat Diet."

There should be a link appearing at the top right now.

Please click on this link to watch the video and understand the concept of dietary classification.

It will be a bit more helpful for you to watch the video.

Now, let's talk about the mistakes that can occur when following a low-carb, high-fat diet.

The diet I will be using as a reference is the one I follow.

Because I haven't tried other diets, I don't know the mistakes that can occur with those diets.

And the low-carb, high-fat diet that I follow is probably linked at the top right.

I made a video about the low-carb, high-fat diet of Longe.

It is explained in detail in that video.

Please refer to that video and find out what type of diet the mistakes mentioned in this video are occurring in.

So, what mistakes do people make the most?

It is a case where one becomes obsessed with the idea that standardizing and regulating their diet is the only way to lose weight.

When you first start a low-carb, high-fat diet, you will go through the process of combining your meals.

In the case of the long-term diet, there are no restrictions on vegetables or meat, so it is more intense.

Even if you follow a different low-carb, high-fat diet, you are not limited to just one type of meat.

There are a variety of types, both for vegetables and other things.

So even if I say, "Feel free to eat,"

Since we're going to eat anyway, I feel like we should eat something good for our bodies.

I'm looking for various information about vegetables, meat, and oil, just like you're watching my video right now.

However, this means that there is really a lot of information on the internet.

Olive oil is better than cooking oil.

Extra virgin olive oil is the best.

There is a fat called lard that comes from pork fat, and it is rich in vitamin D.

Modern people are lacking in vitamin D, which is a very good oil.

If we move towards vegetables, tomatoes are included in the world's top 10 foods.

It is said that Italian men have good stamina because they eat tomatoes all the time.

Broccoli is also among the top 10 foods in the world, and it's said to be good for building muscle.

Enoki mushrooms contain a lot of mushroom chitosan, which is said to be helpful for dieting.

I heard that someone who lost 20 kg after eating this appeared on a show.

Chinese people eat a lot of greasy food.

They say the reason I can eat like that and not gain weight is because of onions.

There is an enormous amount of this information available on the internet.

Then you can look at this and try changing the combinations to see how it tastes.

This doesn't mean it's bad.

If you're going to eat, it's better to eat healthy food.

It's not that looking for this kind of information is bad.

When I combine things like this and search, there are times when it feels like I've found the perfect diet for me.

If there is someone who measures their weight every day, there will be days when the number on the scale decreases significantly.

Alternatively, there's something called "eye body," where you don't measure your weight but instead look in the mirror. One day, you might think, "Oh? My body line looks a bit nicer today?"

Or you might be someone who doesn't check the scale or your body visually.

There are times when I suddenly feel light and in good condition.

I don't know if this is actually the case or just my feeling, but...

When this happens, what comes to mind is...

I feel like what I'm eating right now is really a good diet.

Because it's a diet that was completed with great effort.

I searched a lot of information on the internet, combined it, and tried it out.

And thanks to the diet, I have lost a lot of weight.

So, the current diet is really a good diet.

The thought that "I have to eat this way to lose weight" gets stuck in my head.

Then what happens in some cases is that

There are times when it's mealtime, but I'm not hungry.

Then you shouldn't eat because you're not hungry.

However, I have the thought that "I need to follow a diet to lose weight."

As a justification for this, it was said, "You shouldn't starve yourself. Starving diets are not good; you should lose weight while eating."

So even though you're not hungry right now, think of it as a meal plan and go ahead and prepare and eat it.

However, this is a huge mistake.

A starvation diet is when the body tells you that your energy is low and you are lacking energy, but ignoring this and not eating is what constitutes a starvation diet.

If you have enough energy in your body and don't feel like eating,

There is no need to eat food.

What the situation is right now is that

The reason we become obese is not because our bodies need to store body fat.

I ate foods that quickly raise blood sugar, which caused my blood sugar to become too high.

I accumulated body fat and became obese in order to lower my blood sugar.

So that means the fat in my body right now is mostly unnecessary fat.

It's meal time, so I'm making sure to eat well. With plenty of energy coming into my body, I feel good.

Ah... right now my weight is about 80kg, and it's just too heavy.

It's heavy because I didn't accumulate it out of necessity.

It's heavy, and my heart is struggling, and my legs are having a hard time supporting 80 kg.

I think it would be more efficient to keep it light.

Then you need to remove some fat, right? So you talk to the owner about it.

Master, I have too much fat in my body right now, so my energy efficiency is poor, so I need to use this a bit.

When you use fat, energy is produced, so your body tells you that there is no need to eat new food.

I'm going to use body fat now.

However, if you eat without listening to your body's signals,

I am blocking the timing when I can use body fat right now.

Don't use body fat, I'll eat new food.

In this way, you will miss the timing for significant fat loss.

Of course, this diet is not necessarily a weight loss diet; it is a healthy diet.

Most people who start this diet have weight loss as their goal, right?

However, if you miss the best timing for weight loss because of such thoughts, it would be a huge mistake.

So I'm saying not to do it this way.

Do I want to eat? Do I not want to eat? You need to keep checking if you are feeling hungry right now.

And there is no feeling of hunger. If you feel that you have no desire to eat...

You should not eat at this time.

If you feel hungry 1 to 2 hours after that timing, you can eat then.

Some people may wonder what the difference is between 1 to 2 hours, but...

In fact, the amount of fat consumed during a 1 to 2 hour fast is quite significant.

The fat that is used because the body says it needs it makes a big difference in just 1 to 2 hours.

I hope you don't miss this opportunity.

What is the second mistake?

This time, it's a case where I'm hungry but not eating food.

After hearing this, there may be some people who will say, "What nonsense is that?"

It means to eat when you're hungry and not to eat when you're full.

You might think, "Is there really someone who can't keep something this simple?"

It actually exists.

Hearing it without being in that situation makes it sound like a foolish story.

Even I, looking back on that situation, realize it was a foolish choice.

At that time, it felt like the best thing.

It's because we are caught up in such misconceptions, so it's not a mistake but an error.

And just being aware that such a misconception can arise is enough.

You can significantly reduce mistakes.

So this is why I make these kinds of videos.

So, what process leads to the formation of a misconception?

As I mentioned earlier, I skipped my meal while feeling full.

I didn't eat because I was full, and the next day my weight had dropped significantly.

The body is saying, "I will use the body fat inside me. Please don't eat; I don't need it."

I responded by saying, "Okay, I won't eat on my own then."

Then the body will start using body fat.

Body fat is used and discarded.

As body fat is burned, water is also lost, which is why weight decreases significantly.

In just one day, you can lose 0.7 to 0.8 kg, and in severe cases, it can exceed 1 kg.

There are cases where this happens just once and ends.

Some people may not feel hungry the next day and end up fasting.

The next day, I was hungry and ate some food.

The next day, I wasn't hungry all day again.

Some people eat one meal a day for 3 or 4 days.

However, this is not something that is forced to be endured.

I only get hungry at that specific time, so that's how I eat.

As my body fat decreases like this, after some time has passed later on...

There will come a time when I get hungry after this is over.

At this time, what dominates my thoughts is

I start to think, should I try to endure a little longer?

Because there has been weight loss during that time, it decreases so noticeably.

If I can hold on for just a day or two more, I feel like I'll be close to my target weight.

So I'm thinking, should I just hold on for one more day?

But the important thing is that the situation is different, right?

The reason my weight dropped so significantly is that my body was not in a state of hunger.

It's because I'm not putting in food, so I'm using body fat.

Right now, my body is speaking, saying, "I have no energy, please give me food."

In this situation, if I don't eat, it's like a disaster for my body.

The owner makes sure to eat well during mealtime.

I realized that the fat in my body is unnecessary, so I got rid of it.

I thought I should throw away everything I need to and eat, so I said, "I'm hungry," but they didn't give me any food.

Wow... this is a big problem, I shouldn't have used the 지방 like this.

From now on, I should avoid using fat.

The timing for a significant weight loss that could have happened soon.

It means that it may not come for a long time in the future.

This means that it is a huge loss.

In the end, it's one thing.

Listen to what your body is telling you.

Since your stomach is full, it's a good time to lose weight, so you don't have to eat.

When you say you are hungry, it means your body is signaling that it is hungry.

So that the body can feel, "I can always eat whenever I want."

At that time, you just need to put in the food.

Ignoring this and not listening to your body's signals is a mistake, so please don't do that.

You understand, right?
