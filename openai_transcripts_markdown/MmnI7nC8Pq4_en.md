Loneliness leads to binge eating and hinders dieting - Eating Disorders Part 10

This is the tenth video about eating disorders.

In this video, I will talk about binge eating caused by loneliness.

Humans are said to be social animals.

We live by endlessly forming relationships with others and because we have a dependency on those relationships.

When there is a lack of such interpersonal relationships, a person begins to feel loneliness.

Such loneliness can be a cause of binge eating.

In most cases, when people gain weight, they tend to avoid meeting others.

There are times when I refrain from going out because I'm concerned about how others perceive me.

I don't care about others' opinions, but there are times when I don't want to meet someone with this body.

This can lead to a lack of interpersonal relationships, resulting in feelings of loneliness.

To forget this loneliness, I often seek food.

It's not that I'm eating because I'm hungry; I'm eating because my heart is hungry.

However, I eat food to forget my loneliness, but...

No matter how much food I eat, loneliness cannot be filled.

So, you end up eating more and more food, and if this worsens, it leads to binge eating.

When I joined a diet school or a fasting center, it was easy to stick to the meal plan.

Some people struggle to stick to their diet and end up binge eating when they try to do it alone.

In the case of such individuals, the cause of binge eating is often loneliness.

In diet schools or fasting centers, people in similar situations gather together.

Because I build relationships with people like this, I don't feel lonely, which makes it easier to stick to my diet.

It's hard to stick to my diet because I'm overeating due to loneliness when I'm doing it alone.

The reason is loneliness, so meeting people can be helpful.

The problem is that I don't want to meet people.

One of the alternatives in this case is an online meeting.

Recently, there are many messenger programs and voice chat programs for online conversations.

Due to programs like this, online gatherings have become very active.

In Korea, there are open KakaoTalk rooms that utilize the messenger app KakaoTalk.

The Discord channel, which utilizes the voice chat program Discord, is very popular.

Such online gatherings can help you make friends and build relationships while sharing conversations, but...

There is an advantage in not having to reveal my true self.

Building interpersonal relationships online can somewhat reduce loneliness.

It can help improve symptoms of binge eating caused by loneliness.

However, this method is only a supplementary approach.

Ultimately, the goal should be to meet real people.

Why? If you're satisfied online, can't you just maintain relationships online?

When I stand, I want to sit.

When I sit, I want to lie down.

When lying down, it's natural for a person to want to sleep.

In situations of deep loneliness, I was satisfied just to be able to have a conversation.

As time goes by, the desire to attend gatherings in real life begins to arise.

However, the reason for forming interpersonal relationships online is

I don't want to show my fat appearance right now.

So I cannot attend real-life gatherings.

I want to go to the gathering, but I can't because I'm overweight.

Such thoughts lower self-esteem and lead to feelings of depression.

Due to this depression, I might binge eat again.

You may become heavily dependent on the online world because you want to forget reality.

You need to be careful to avoid this happening.

So, online meetings are ultimately just a supplementary means.

In the end, you have to meet people in reality. You need to remember this part.
