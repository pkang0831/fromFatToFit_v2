Does drinking cold water help you lose weight? - Water Diet Part 1

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitle feature.

There is a saying that drinking cold water helps you lose weight.

The reason for this statement is due to body temperature.

Humans are warm-blooded animals that need to maintain a constant body temperature.

So when the body temperature drops, it tries to raise the temperature.

When the body temperature rises, it tries to lower it again.

Drinking cold water lowers body temperature, and

In the process of raising the lowered body temperature, energy is consumed.

This means that weight loss occurs through the energy that is consumed.

In an experiment where cold water is actually consumed and the body's changes are observed,

Drinking cold water lowered my body temperature.

It has also been confirmed that the metabolic rate increases during the process of raising a lowered body temperature.

Really? So it's true that drinking cold water helps with weight loss?

If that's the case, then by drinking colder water, will it lower my body temperature even more?

Does burning more energy to raise body temperature lead to more weight loss?

Should I drink ice water?

That's not the case.

Drinking cold water lowers body temperature, and

To raise the lowered body temperature, it is true that metabolism increases and energy is consumed.

The energy consumed in this way does not lead to weight loss.

The logic similar to what has just been mentioned is the claim that living in a cold environment leads to weight loss.

Living in a cold environment lowers body temperature.

The claim is that energy is expended to raise body temperature, and as metabolism increases, it leads to weight loss.

When actually exposed to a cold environment

There are studies that confirm an increase in metabolic rate and a reduction in body fat.

I talked about body temperature and dieting in part 3 of the video.

When the experiment was conducted over a short period, the results showed a reduction in body fat.

However, when conducted over a long period, the reduced body fat returned to its original levels.

So, it has a temporary effect.

It means that the effect will fade over time.

The video link is currently displayed in the upper right corner.

If you are curious about why body fat increases again, you can click here to see.

So, if you live in a cold environment, your body temperature decreases.

It consumes energy to raise body temperature, which leads to weight loss.

Drinking cold water lowers body temperature, and

It consumes energy to raise body temperature, so it leads to weight loss.

These two arguments share the same logic.

Living in a cold environment can reduce body fat in the short term, but...

Because body fat tends to increase again over time.

It seems that there is actually no effect on dieting.

Drinking cold water does not create a weight loss effect due to the energy expended.

Therefore, if you like cold water and there are no problems with drinking it, you can go ahead and drink it.

I don't like cold water, and it makes my stomach uncomfortable when I drink it.

If you are forcing yourself to drink for the purpose of dieting, it means you don't need to drink it.

So, does cold water have no significance in dieting?

It's not a big difference, but it can be helpful if you drink it in the morning.

The energy a person consumes in a day consists of basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate.

Basal metabolic rate refers to the energy that is constantly consumed to maintain life.

The active metabolic rate refers to the energy expended when you move.

Exercise metabolic rate refers to the energy expended during physical activity.

Most of the basal metabolic rate is the energy consumed by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

When we sleep, our organs also take a rest, which causes the basal metabolic rate to decrease.

I got enough sleep and woke up in the morning.

There are times when you can't fully wake up and remain in a dazed state.

In this case, the consciousness is awake and the body is moving, but...

The organs of the body are not completely awake yet.

So, the metabolic rate is being maintained at a low level.

Drinking cold water at this time has the effect of awakening the body, including the organs.

However, this method should only be done after you have had a good night's sleep.

As mentioned in the sleep diet series,

Getting good sleep is also very important for dieting.

Waking the body up forcefully when you haven't slept properly can have the opposite effect.

After getting enough sleep,

Drinking a glass of cold water upon waking up can be beneficial.

Conversely, drinking cold water before going to sleep at night is not a good idea.

It forcibly wakes up the organs that need to sleep, disrupting deep sleep.

One of the reasons drinking water can help with dieting is that it provides a feeling of fullness.

They say that drinking water creates a feeling of fullness, which reduces meal portions and helps with dieting.

In the end, it's about reducing the amount of food you eat, which leads to dieting.

Does water itself have no effect on dieting?

Can I substitute with konjac or cabbage?

In the next video, I will talk about this question.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the water diet, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making it.
