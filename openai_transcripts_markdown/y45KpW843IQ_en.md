Reasons for a 163cm, 52kg woman wanting to diet.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

There is a video I made recently about high school girls.

I am 163 cm tall, and I reduced my weight to 37 kg by starving myself.

I went to the hospital with my parents.

After that, I did eat food, but I was so scared of gaining weight that I only had one meal for dinner.

I feel frustrated and scared because my weight has increased to 52 kg after just a few months.

This is a video created based on a story requesting help with dieting.

If you look at the comments on that video,

At 163 cm and 52 kg, that is a sufficiently slim weight.

I can't understand why people want to diet more.

Why are you not satisfied with a normal weight and aiming for underweight in your diet?

There were many reactions like this.

The video didn't mention it, but...

The person in question hopes to weigh around 45 to 48 kg, which is indeed underweight for their height.

In this video, the person who is 163 cm tall and weighs 52 kg explains why they want to lose weight.

Why is the target weight set at a low range of 45 to 48 kg?

I would like to talk a bit about the reason for that.

First of all, a height of 163 cm and a weight of 52 kg is indeed within the normal range when viewed numerically.

In reality, when calculating the level of obesity, it comes out as normal, and it is close to being underweight even within the normal range.

So someone with that height and weight seems to be slim enough and probably doesn't need to diet.

In reality, there are quite a few cases where this is not true.

One piece of advice about dieting is not to worry too much about your weight.

When we gain weight and our body fat increases, our weight also goes up.

Even if you increase your muscle mass through exercise, your weight can still go up.

Muscle is much heavier than fat.

A body with a lot of muscle can have a high weight even if it has low body fat.

If you actually search the internet for "same weight, different feeling," you'll find...

Even with the same weight, the body looks completely different in many photos due to differences in body fat and muscle mass.

So even if the weight is high,

If you have low body fat and a high muscle mass, you can definitely have a slim and good physique.

It means not to stress too much about gaining weight.

However, if we think about this story from a different perspective,

Even if the weight is low,

Having a high amount of body fat and low muscle mass can mean that you may not be slim.

In a video I made previously about subcutaneous fat, I talked about the relationship between subcutaneous fat and muscle.

Subcutaneous fat is the fat located just beneath the skin.

It is the fat that is located on the outermost layer of the body, excluding the skin, and is spread throughout the entire body.

So it's fat that is difficult to utilize for energy.

Instead, since it is on the outermost part of the body, except for the skin.

It has a protective effect that shields the body from external shocks and prevents the loss of body heat.

There are muscles beneath the subcutaneous fat.

This muscle generates heat when used.

People with low muscle mass generate less heat in their bodies.

It is beneficial for maintaining body temperature to insulate so that the small amount of heat is not lost.

People with low muscle mass have an increased need for subcutaneous fat, which has a warming effect.

On the other hand, a person with a lot of muscle mass generates a lot of heat within their body.

If the body temperature rises too high due to that much heat, it becomes difficult to maintain body temperature.

To maintain body temperature, it is beneficial to expel the excess heat from the body.

In this case, the insulating ability of subcutaneous fat that prevents heat from being released from the body becomes a hindrance.

Simply put, when muscle mass increases, subcutaneous fat decreases.

When muscle mass decreases, subcutaneous fat increases.

If you are 163 cm tall and have reduced your weight to 37 kg through starvation dieting,

During this process, a significant amount of muscle is inevitably lost.

When muscle loss occurs like this, the need for subcutaneous fat increases.

It is highly likely that subcutaneous fat has increased significantly during the process of gaining weight up to 52 kg.

However, that person mentioned that they walked for 2 hours each day.

If you exercised for 2 hours, wouldn't your muscle mass have increased significantly?

To increase muscle mass, all three of these are necessary: exercise, nutrition, and rest.

The person in the story lost weight down to 37 kg and went to the hospital with their parents.

Since then, I have increased my meal portions, but...

I said that I only had one meal for dinner because I was afraid of gaining weight.

The necessary nutrient intake for growth is not being properly met.

Walking exercise is difficult to provide the necessary intensity for muscle growth.

It is difficult to say that muscle mass has increased sufficiently.

As mentioned earlier, muscle is much heavier than body fat.

When heavy muscle decreases and light body fat increases,

You can become obese with a low weight but high body fat.

This is called dry obesity.

And the subcutaneous fat is located on the outermost part of the body, excluding the skin.

With soft and supple skin, it cannot support the subcutaneous fat.

If there is a lot of subcutaneous fat, it will sag due to gravity.

The commonly referred to arm fat, side fat, and belly fat are all types of subcutaneous fat.

Even if the weight is light, if there is that much fat...

Of course, you will come to think that dieting is necessary.

This is where the problems start.

When the storyteller saw their own body,

You can see the sagging skin due to subcutaneous fat.

Therefore, I think a diet is necessary.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video, looking at the height and weight, there is no need for a diet.

If you look at indicators like the BMI calculator, it shows that you are normal.

In this case, what the world refers to as "normal" means being slightly chubby.

I fall into the misconception that in order to achieve the slim body I desire, I need to be underweight.

The problem is that with a starvation diet, muscle mass decreases and body fat increases, leading to levels that are outside the normal range.

Without knowing this, one begins to question the very standard of what is considered normal.

Therefore, among those who have severely restricted their diets, many aim for underweight.

People can become trapped in the belief that they need to be underweight in order to get slim.

To summarize the content so far in four points:

Body fat and muscle mass are more important than weight.

If you have low muscle mass and high body fat, you could be considered obese even if your weight is low.

This is called dry obesity.

The third type of skinny obesity is a somewhat distorted form where the balance between muscle and body fat is disrupted.

Therefore, it deviates from the general standard.

Applying general standards to individuals with normal weight obesity, who deviate from the fourth common criterion, can lead to errors.

This leads to people aiming for underweight as a goal for their diet.

It can be organized like this.

As mentioned earlier, what matters is not weight, but body fat and muscle.

Muscle is heavier than fat.

If you increase muscle and reduce fat, your weight may actually increase.

The body can become slimmer.

So, you shouldn't aim for 45 to 48 kg in the first place.

On the surface, you should aim for a slim body weighing around 45 to 48 kg.

The purpose of dieting is not to lower the number on the scale.

Because it leads to a slim body.

I hope you don't become too obsessed with the number on the scale.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

You mentioned in the video that muscle is much heavier than fat.

However, I've heard that it's not true.

That's right.

In the past, there were many comments saying that there is a significant difference between fat and muscle using such photos as examples.

Recently, that photo is too exaggerated.

In reality, there is a growing belief that the difference between fat and muscle is not that significant.

It is common to show examples like this in photos.

However, this compares the fat and muscle by separating them.

In reality, there is a significant difference in weight gain between fat and muscle.

I previously made a detailed explanation video because the same question came up.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

If you're curious, you can click to see it.

You mentioned that in order to reduce body fat, one needs to increase muscle mass.

So, if I do abdominal exercises to increase the muscle mass in my stomach, will that help reduce belly fat?

They say you can't lose weight in specific areas.

This question came up before, and I made a video to answer it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the upper right corner.

If body fat decreases due to temperature regulation,

If you turn on the boiler or wear thick clothes during the summer, it can lead to an uncomfortable living situation.

Can that help reduce body fat?

No, that's not the case.

The heat generated inside the body and the heat generated outside the body are different.

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a video answering it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.
