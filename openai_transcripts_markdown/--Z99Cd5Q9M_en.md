Burning calories through exercise does not necessarily reduce body fat.

Hello, this is pkang.

Many people believe that if they burn calories through exercise, their body fat will decrease by the same amount.

So when choosing exercise for the purpose of dieting,

I think the calories consumed per hour are very important.

I think that exercises with low calorie consumption won't help with dieting, no matter how much you do them.

Exercises that burn a lot of calories are thought to be effective for dieting.

However, that is not the case.

Are you saying that the calories gained from food are greater than the calories burned through exercise?

That's not the kind of story it is.

No matter how many calories you burn through exercise, it doesn't mean that body fat will decrease because of those calories.

For example, I ended up attending a gathering because my friend invited me.

Let's assume that the meeting required a participation fee.

We didn't know that a participation fee was required, so we didn't bring any money.

In that case, I should borrow money from a friend to pay the participation fee.

However, if we have this meeting once more next week, should we borrow money from our friend again next week?

Of course not.

Knowing that a participation fee is required, if you prepare the fee in advance, you won't need to borrow money from a friend.

Similarly, when we first started exercising,

Our bodies do not realize that energy will be consumed through exercise.

So I don't prepare any extra energy.

At this time, the energy consumed through exercise is taken from body fat.

However, if we exercise consistently, our bodies will know that energy will be consumed through exercise.

Then, we start preparing the energy that will be used for exercise in advance.

It's a response that occurs as the body adapts to the situation of consistently exercising.

Because it uses the energy that has been prepared.

Even if you expend energy through exercise, there is no effect on reducing body fat.

When you do exercises that consume a lot of calories, you prepare that amount of energy in advance.

No matter how much calorie-burning exercise you do, it doesn't necessarily lead to a reduction in body fat by the same amount of calories.

Because of this, "Dieting is done through diet, not exercise."

Exercise has no effect on dieting. That's what they are saying.

So does that mean that even if I exercise hard, there is no effect on reducing body fat?

However, you also say that in order to lose weight, you need to exercise, right?

It is not possible to reduce body fat by consuming energy through exercise.

It is possible to increase muscle mass through exercise and reduce body fat.

What this is about is that body fat is divided into two types: visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat refers to the fat located right next to the internal organs.

Because it is very close to the intestines, it serves as a storage for supplying energy.

When our body lacks energy, it uses body fat. The body fat referred to in this context is visceral fat.

Subcutaneous fat is the fat located just beneath the skin.

Because it is located outside of the muscles, it has the characteristic of being very far from the internal organs.

Between subcutaneous fat and visceral fat, there are muscles and bones blocking the way.

So, subcutaneous fat has the characteristic of being very difficult to use as energy.

Instead, it's right under the skin.

It has the characteristic of protecting the body from external shocks or preventing the loss of body heat.

However, since the functions of subcutaneous fat overlap with those of muscles,

When muscle mass increases, the amount of unnecessary subcutaneous fat decreases.

Conversely, when muscle mass decreases, body fat increases to compensate for the loss of muscle.

So, when we say "consume energy through exercise to reduce body fat," the body fat being referred to is visceral fat.

Increase muscle mass through exercise to reduce body fat. The body fat referred to in this context is subcutaneous fat.

Even if you continuously consume energy through exercise, you prepare and use the energy needed for the exercise in advance.

Exercise alone cannot reduce visceral fat.

However, if you increase your muscle mass through exercise,

It is possible to reduce subcutaneous fat because muscle mass has increased.

Regardless of the calories burned through exercise.

When muscle mass increases, it leads to a reduction in subcutaneous fat due to that muscle mass.

In summary, the role of exercise in dieting is to increase muscle mass and reduce body fat.

So, how many calories are burned during exercise is actually not an important part.

However, there is a perception that a lot of calories must be burned through exercise in order to lose weight.

So, people who want to lose weight look for exercises that burn a lot of calories.

However, most of those exercises include jumping movements or involve very fast-paced movements.

There is a problem that the difficulty is too high for someone who is not accustomed to exercising.

In the early stages of starting a diet, you can manage to endure it to some extent.

However, the difficulty of the exercise is so high that while the mind can endure, the body cannot keep up and collapses.

If it's too difficult, there are many cases where people give up in the middle because their willpower for dieting weakens.

However, that means it is not necessary.

What matters is not the calories consumed, but whether muscle mass increases or not.

Depending on the person, even exercises that burn a low number of calories can be sufficient to increase muscle mass.

For example, brisk walking is an exercise that does not burn a lot of calories.

However, in the case of a person who does not exercise at all and has very low activity levels,

The muscles needed for brisk walking are not developed because I have low activity levels and do not exercise.

So in the case of such a person, just walking quickly can increase muscle mass.

When muscle mass increases, the amount of subcutaneous fat decreases.

The reason many people have succeeded in dieting through brisk walking, which doesn't burn a lot of calories, is because of this.

So, does just walking fast help with weight loss?

It depends on how much you want to reduce your body fat.

A person who lacks the muscles needed for brisk walking has very little muscle mass.

A person with very little muscle mass would likely have a lot of subcutaneous fat instead.

In the case of such a person, if they engage in brisk walking exercise, the muscles needed for brisk walking will develop.

The amount of subcutaneous fat will decrease in accordance with the developed muscle mass.

Once the muscles needed for fast walking are fully developed, no further muscle growth will occur.

If you want to reduce body fat further, you can increase the intensity of your workouts to build more muscle mass.

As muscle mass increases, body fat decreases accordingly.

So when I choose a diet exercise,

Just because an exercise burns a lot of calories doesn't mean you have to force yourself to do it.

Just because you do that exercise doesn't mean it will be more helpful for your diet.

I can keep going steadily without giving up, so just give me some exercises that are a bit challenging for my body.

The fact that my body is struggling means that my muscles need to develop.

If I continue to do that exercise without giving up, my muscles will gradually develop.

If that exercise becomes no longer difficult, it means your muscles have fully developed, so you can increase the difficulty.

Just by doing this, your muscles will develop sufficiently, and as your muscles develop, you can reduce subcutaneous fat.

People who build muscle often eat chicken breast or protein. Why do they eat these?

In the next video, I will talk about this.

There are currently two videos on the screen. Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not about chicken breast or protein, please wait a few more days as I am still in the process of making the video.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
