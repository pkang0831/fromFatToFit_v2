The theme of this video is the value of youth.

In the past, YG's representative Yang Hyun-suk appeared on a TV broadcast and

The trainees at YG talk about seeing young friends in their teens and twenties.

I’m talking about whether you envy the company I have, YG, or my assets.

Then the trainees answered, "Of course, we are envious."

What Yang Hyun-suk said when he saw those friends was, "I envy the youth you all have."

You can do anything.

The YG company I have, my wealth, social status, and honor...

If I could give everything and exchange it for the youth you have, I would do it sincerely.

So I’m saying don’t underestimate the value of your youth and don’t waste it.

That's a good saying. It's a good saying.

Youth is a good thing, and it shouldn't be wasted.

However, hearing this story, I felt the same way back when I was watching the broadcast.

It is a boring story for most people.

Because I don't feel that those words are sincere.

I have also been getting older recently, one year at a time.

I sometimes think that childhood was better.

As you get older, there will be things you can no longer do.

There is a sense of regret about such things.

I really envy youth.

If we say everything that Yang Hyun-suk has, its value is...

Yang Hyun-suk's wealth: 219 billion won in 2013.

YG is one of the top three entertainment companies in South Korea, no matter what anyone says.

They have considerable assets as well.

There are people who cannot accumulate the wealth that this person has even if they work their whole lives.

So, youth is really great, but are you really going to change these two things?

That's just something people say because it's impossible.

Even if it's really possible, the common thought among people is to not change it.

I felt the same way, and the internet reactions at the time were similar.

However, recently I have been reflecting on the value of youth and the value of time.

I started to think that it might be sincere.

There is a person named CK Lewis who does stand-up comedy in the United States.

This person is saying something similar to Yang Hyun-suk.

Listening to this person makes it easy to understand the content.

In the case of Louis, he is someone who has achieved a lot of success in stand-up comedy in the United States.

They are popular, have a high social status, a good reputation, and likely have a certain amount of wealth.

However, as you can see in the photo, there isn't much hair.

So one day, Luis comes out and tells this story in his stand-up comedy.

As you walk down the street, you will see numerous homeless people.

When I see a homeless person with really thick hair,

Even if I go to that person and give away all my social status, reputation, and wealth that I have right now.

There are times when I feel like I want to have that hair.

Since it's a story from a comedy, the audience is laughing really happily.

Luis waited until the audience was laughing.

After the audience's laughter subsides, he speaks very seriously.

Does it sound like I'm joking? No, I'm serious.

Then, when the audience reacts with "Huh?", that's when Luis starts to talk about something.

If I were to give everything I have and become a homeless person in exchange for receiving hair,

I will beg to gather enough money to go to the bathhouse and to buy a clean set of clothes.

And then, after going to a nearby bathhouse to wash up cleanly and changing into fresh clothes,

I'm going to the nearest comedy club.

And if you spend about 2 to 3 years there,

I will return to where I am now, and I tell myself that my hair will be full.

Isn't it really cool?

So, the social status, popularity, honor, and wealth that Luis has achieved now are

It's something that was achieved through Luis's abilities.

So even if I give everything I have achieved,

It means that as long as I have my abilities, I can return to my original position.

You are that confident in your abilities.

And from this perspective,

What Mr. Yang Hyun-suk mentioned earlier

Even if I were given the YG company I have built, my social status, reputation, honor, and wealth, I would still want to buy my youth.

This means that it may not be a lie.

Can't we just do it again?

If you become younger, you'll have plenty of time.

You can start over from scratch and build a company like YG.

Since I've been on this path before, I can go further and more easily.

However, what I want to talk about in this video is not about people like Yang Hyun-suk or Luis.

I want to talk about it based on the perspective of a homeless person or a YG trainee.

Let's talk about the story of a homeless person.

The homeless person gave their hair and received popularity, social status, reputation, and wealth from Luis.

In the end, it's not Luis.

So the popularity that existed because of Luis gradually declines because the homeless person is not Luis.

Social status and reputation will gradually disappear.

Due to the absence of these two things, additional sources of income are blocked.

No matter how much wealth Luis has, it will gradually decrease as he spends it.

In the end, if you spend it all, you'll end up back as a homeless person.

On top of that, this time it's not just a homeless person, but a bald homeless person.

Because I gave my hair to Luis earlier.

If what I have built is not through my own abilities, it means that over time, it will gradually disappear.

However, this example may not resonate with you.

Because I give everything I have to receive youth.

I give everything I have in exchange for hair.

This is not realistic.

Then, let's set this example aside and talk about something more realistic.

A typical example would be something like the lottery.

I won the lottery and received a prize of several hundred million to several billion won.

I couldn't manage it and ended up using it all up after a few years, returning to my original life.

The story that one ends up living a worse life is something we can easily see.

However, if you say that winning the lottery feels distant because the odds are so low, then...

There is also something like a key money.

I paid several million won in key money to enter a well-performing store, but...

I don't know the reason, but as time went by, the business wasn't doing well, so they closed the store.

Many people end up failing like this.

However, that doesn't mean that everyone who wins the lottery ends up losing all their money.

A store that has paid for goodwill is not necessarily doomed to fail.

There are some people who manage the money they received from winning the lottery well and grow it even more.

Similarly, there are people who run their stores well and do good business.

There are cases where businesses are sold after being expanded significantly, resulting in receiving a higher premium.

The difference that separates those who can do that from those who cannot is what?

It's a story about ability.

Do you have the ability to manage several hundred million won effectively?

If a store is worth several tens of millions of won in goodwill, it must be a popular place with many customers.

Do you have the ability to maintain a store like this?

There are often stories like this on the internet.

It's hard to save 100 million won, but if you have 100 million won...

There is a saying that turning 100 million into 200 million is easy.

Then I'll give you 100 million won now, so how can we turn this into 200 million won?

When you ask someone to talk about what needs to be done, there aren't many people who can provide an answer.

The essence of that story is what?

A person who has the ability to create 100 million won from nothing is...

When you have a seed money of 100 million won, it takes relatively less time to turn it into 200 million won.

The standard itself is based on the ability of a person to accumulate 100 million.

Just because someone has 100 million doesn't mean they can easily turn it into 200 million.

So in the end, it means that skills are necessary.

But when it comes to ability...

Getting good grades on exams.

It is easy to think of having a good certification as something academic.

The ability being referred to here is not about academic skills.

There are many people who make money just by watching YouTube, which has nothing to do with academic ability.

The YouTuber conducting experiments was very curious, and they created popular videos by experimenting with that curiosity.

There are those who create videos with interesting storytelling and actions.

Some people are good at listening to others' concerns.

Singing well, drawing well, playing musical instruments well,

Being lively and good at acting,

The most unique thing is me.

I don't really have any particular talent.

Stitching together stories from the internet, trying to create theories and twist them around.

It's like a quirky person who establishes their own theory.

When I talked about this at a drinking party, my friends found it interesting.

So, I thought, "If I upload this to YouTube, there might be people who like it," and that's why I'm making the video.

All of this is a form of ability. Even if it's not academic, all of this is still a capability.

This means that I can improve the quality of my life as much as I want using this.

What is needed for that is time.

Because even just the examples given now have various types.

There are many types of talents, jobs, and fields in the world.

Among those, I need to find what I'm interested in and what I like, which also takes time.

To find out what I am good at among the things I've discovered, I need to take some time to explore.

So if I took the time to find what I'm good at,

It takes time to hone the skills needed to master what you are good at.

In the end, it means that time is necessary for abilities to be cultivated.

And having a lot of time means, in other words, being young.

That's why youth has value.

However, when we talk about being young, it only includes those in their teens, twenties, and early thirties.

People in their late 30s and those in their 40s to 60s may think, "We're not young anymore, so we don't have time."

No.

Why do you feel the need to compare your youth with others? There's no need for that.

The me of this year has a whole year more than the me of next year.

It's one year younger.

Hansil is younger, right?

At this moment, I am the youngest I will ever be for the rest of my life.

It means having the most time.

So please don't think that way.

Doing nothing is not the best option.

Whatever it is that you like or are interested in, take enough time and focus on it.

Then that will become a skill, and later it will have value.

Sounds plausible, right?
