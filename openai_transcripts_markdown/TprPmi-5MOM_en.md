Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third part of the video responding to a question that was posted in the comments.

If you have any questions, please pause the screen and check the question details.

Visceral fat is easy to lose, but subcutaneous fat is not. Is there a good way to lose subcutaneous fat?

In Part 1 of the video, the differences between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat are discussed.

I looked into why men's diets and women's diets are different.

In the second part of the video, we talked about exercises to reduce body fat.

In this video, we will talk about how to reduce subcutaneous fat through diet control.

Since this is a continuation of the previous videos,

If you haven't watched the previous video, you may misunderstand or find it difficult to understand the content.

The links to Part 1 and Part 2 videos are available at the top right, so I recommend that those who haven't seen them go and watch.

Considering the content of parts 1 and 2 of the video, it seems that you can't lose subcutaneous fat without exercising.

In reality, there are many people who have lost body fat solely through diet control without exercising.

Most women have subcutaneous fat obesity.

Women often focus more on diet control rather than exercise when it comes to dieting.

Subcutaneous fat serves a strong role as a shield and clothing.

Because it is fat, it can also be used as energy.

It is possible to lose body fat solely through diet without doing any exercise.

However, if body fat is used as energy, there will be no clothing to prevent the loss of body heat.

Because more body heat is lost and the energy used to maintain body temperature increases.

Using subcutaneous fat as energy is very inefficient.

If you burn your clothes to make a fire because it's cold, you'll be warm as long as the fire lasts, but...

It will be colder after the lights go out because there are no clothes.

Using subcutaneous fat as energy is a last resort.

Under normal circumstances, body fat is not used as energy.

So they say that if you only diet through your meal plan, you won't lose belly fat no matter what.

However, there are limitations, so if you really push yourself, you can remove it.

The problem is what comes next.

To lose body fat through diet, you need to push your body to its limits.

I have really been starving for a long time or following a low-calorie diet.

The starvation response, which leads to a decrease in basal metabolic rate and muscle loss, occurs first.

If that situation is maintained for a long time, the body will finally start using fat as energy.

Muscle mass decreases due to muscle loss, and subcutaneous fat has been used as energy, so it has decreased.

The energy expended to protect the body and maintain body temperature increases.

To replenish the energy being consumed, appetite gradually increases.

When you eat food, your body quickly stores fat as a protective layer for your clothes and as a shield.

Due to muscle loss, the amount of muscle has decreased, so I am trying to store more subcutaneous fat.

So when you are on a diet, the body fat decreases.

When you finish a diet and start eating again, body fat tends to increase rapidly and significantly.

So, if you fail at dieting and experience yo-yo dieting,

You find yourself in a situation where you have to keep dieting endlessly.

A woman's diet never ends. Women diet for a lifetime.

The reason for this saying is that most women have subcutaneous fat obesity.

This is because there are many people who are dieting through dietary control.

I know that diet is more important than exercise for weight loss.

Does that mean that for women, exercise is more important than diet?

It is true that diet is more important than exercise in dieting.

However, the diet being referred to here is not a low-calorie diet.

If you eat too much processed food, your body will continue to accumulate fat.

No matter what method I use, I can't seem to lose weight properly.

First and foremost, it means that reducing the intake of processed foods is the most important thing.

By following a diet that reduces the intake of processed foods, you will naturally lose weight.

To further reduce body fat, you need to either eat less or exercise more.

This means that exercise is more effective than low-calorie diets.

I will summarize.

There are three methods to reduce body fat: low-calorie diet, exercise, and non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT).

Losing subcutaneous fat with a low-calorie diet is very difficult, and

Even if you manage to lose weight with difficulty, it's likely to come back easily, so it's not a method I would particularly recommend.

If you want to lose body fat through exercise,

Rather than focusing on exercises for specific areas you want to slim down, full-body workouts are much more effective.

Don't just do half squats to lose thigh fat or only crunches to lose belly fat.

It is recommended to do full-body exercises, preferably high-intensity workouts.

High-intensity exercise does not necessarily mean you have to run or lift heavy weights.

Depending on the person, walking can be a high-intensity workout.

I recently made a video about high-intensity workouts that are suitable for my body.

The video link is at the top right, so if you haven't seen the video, you can click to watch it.

How to lose body fat through NEAT exercise.

The more frequently and longer you do it, the stronger the effect, and the less often and shorter you do it, the weaker the effect.

Please do it as often and for as long as possible.

Combining exercise with knitting is the most effective approach.

If you find it difficult to exercise, you can just consistently do knit exercises.

Sounds plausible, right?
