They say watching videos while eating makes you gain weight, but if I don't, I eat too quickly.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I mentioned before that watching videos like dramas or movies while eating is not good for dieting.

However, there was a comment saying that if you eat without looking at anything, you tend to eat too quickly.

There is a saying that eating food quickly is not good for dieting.

So, if you eat while watching videos like dramas or movies, it's not good for your diet because you're focused on the video.

Eating without watching videos can lead to eating quickly, which is not good for dieting.

This is a question asking, "What should I do?"

Let's talk in detail.

Why is eating while watching videos and eating quickly not good for dieting?

It's because we tend to eat more food than necessary.

The human body is regulated by signals through hormones.

When you need food, the ghrelin hormone is released, signaling that you are hungry.

When you eat enough food, the hormone leptin is released, signaling feelings of fullness.

However, when eating while watching a video or eating quickly,

The signals of fullness are not being properly transmitted, and that's the problem.

When you focus on work or a game, there are times when you forget about hunger.

When we focus on something, it is because the signals that disrupt that focus are blocked.

The movies and dramas that I find interesting are engaging because they are fun, so I can't help but focus on them.

When you focus on movies and dramas, the signals of fullness are blocked.

When the signals of fullness are blocked, even if you eat enough food, you do not feel the sensation of fullness.

I end up overeating because I don't feel full.

I ate all the food I prepared, but since I'm not full, I might bring out some dessert to eat.

The amount of food prepared in the first place was large, but we eat it all without leaving anything behind.

In reality, when I was eating while watching the video, I didn't feel full, so I ended up eating more.

After the video ends, when I get up to tidy up and move, my stomach feels so bloated that it seems like it might burst.

There are quite a few cases where one feels very full and experiences a heavy stomach.

I understand that watching videos while eating is not good for dieting.

What is the problem with eating quickly?

The timing of the satiety signals is the problem.

In order for us to eat food and for the feeling of fullness to signal, a certain amount of time is needed.

If you eat food quickly, you may feel full before you even realize it.

You may already be in a state of overeating.

This is the problem.

So in the end, overeating is the problem, right?

Then, if you prepare a suitable amount of food and eat just that...

Does it really matter whether you watch the video or eat quickly?

Yes, that's right.

From a dieting perspective, the problem ultimately lies in overeating.

Prepare a suitable amount of food and just eat that.

However, this does not address the cause; it is responding to the result.

This method cannot solve the problem.

For example, let's say you injured your arm, and as a result, you are feeling pain.

The injury to the arm is the cause, and the pain is the result.

Taking painkillers can temporarily reduce pain, but...

The injury to the arm that is causing the pain still exists, so the problem is not resolved.

When the effect of the painkiller wears off, you start to feel the pain again.

In the same concept.

Watching videos during meals and eating food quickly.

These two factors prevent you from feeling full properly, which leads to overeating.

If we leave this cause unaddressed and only respond to the result of overeating, we will not find a solution.

You have to stop eating when you're not feeling full, so there's less satisfaction.

There is a desire to eat more, but I have to suppress it with willpower.

If this situation continues, an unbearable limit will inevitably be reached.

When limits are reached, it is common to binge eat as a form of compensation.

To solve the problem, it's not about responding to the results.

You need to address the cause.

So in the end, it means that you shouldn't watch videos while eating and you shouldn't eat quickly, right?

You can watch the video after finishing your meal, so it seems like you might not watch it.

How can I solve the issue of eating quickly when I don't look at anything?

There are various methods.

The simplest and easiest way is to use music.

There is an experiment that shows how the environment in which food is consumed affects the speed of eating and the amount of food consumed.

The food is prepared in a buffet style.

One side is crowded with people, noisy, and has fast music playing while eating.

On the other side, there were fewer people, it was quiet, and when they had their meals in an environment with slow music playing,

People who dined in the first environment

I ate quickly and had more than an average of four plates of food.

People who ate in the second environment

I ate slowly and consumed an average of less than three plates of food.

The dining environment affected the speed of eating.

The amount of food consumed changed according to the speed of eating.

Fast music makes actions faster.

Conversely, it is also possible for quiet and slow music to slow down actions.

There is also advice to focus and try eating slowly in order to truly taste the original flavors of the food.

What do you think of this method?

That method is also fine.

In fact, the most important thing for eating slowly is to enjoy the food with a sense of leisure.

If it can be induced, it doesn't matter what method is used.

It's nice to enjoy food while listening to quiet and slow music.

To truly savor the original flavors of food, it can be nice to eat slowly and with focus.

It’s also fine to pretend to eat elegantly while imagining that I have become a noble.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

Watching videos or eating quickly during the first meal is

If the signals of fullness are not properly transmitted, it can lead to overeating.

The cause of the second problem remains the same, and we cannot solve the issue by only addressing the results.

While leaving the behaviors that cause overeating unchanged

Restraining oneself to avoid overeating is not a very good method.

Therefore, watching videos while eating and eating food too quickly.

It is advisable to resolve these two issues.

The most important thing needed to eat slowly without watching the third video is...

It is about enjoying food with a sense of leisure.

If it can be induced, it doesn't matter what method is used.

The simplest way is to play quiet and slow music.

I can organize it like this.

Come to think of it, I haven't been thinking about enjoying food.

Since lunch time is limited, I was planning to eat quickly and take a break.

Dinner after work has some time to spare, but...

I mainly eat while watching Netflix, so I focused more on Netflix than on the food.

I never even considered that this eating habit was a problem.

Is there anything else that can help with dieting when you change your mindset like this?

Yes, there is.

In the past, I used to create videos by gathering only those types of materials.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

The causes of overeating remain unchanged.

You mentioned that there are limits to trying not to overeat, right?

I don't watch videos while eating, and I don't eat quickly, but I am still obese.

What could be the reasons for my overeating?

In most cases, it is due to the type of food being eaten.

The food we eat affects our bodies.

Some of the foods we eat can increase our appetite and lead to overeating.

Reducing such foods is the most important thing in dieting.

In the video about the principles of dieting that I made before, I talked about it in detail.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the upper right.

I do not overeat during meal times.

But I often eat snacks because I'm bored.

If I want to diet, I should cut down on snacks, but even when I try to resist, it's not easy.

Is there a reason for wanting to eat snacks, and is it because that reason hasn't been resolved?

That can happen.

There was a similar question in the comments before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

When I diet, I lose weight well, but after a certain point, I always experience a rebound.

Our bodies have a weight that they remember, and

There is a homeostasis that tries to maintain that weight, so it is said that people always return to their original weight.

What should I do about this?

There was a similar question that came up before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
