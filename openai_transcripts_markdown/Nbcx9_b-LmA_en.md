I was on a diet, but I ended up binge eating because I couldn't control myself.

I saw a comment with this kind of content, so I wanted to share my thoughts.

First, let's read the comments.

It has been two weeks since I binge ate, and I have gained 3 kg.

I can start my diet again, but I'm feeling very anxious.

I'm scared to go back to being a pig, and I already feel like I've ruined my life.

I can now control my food intake. I don't want to eat more food.

But I can't control my mind. I feel like I'm going crazy.

I've already gained 3kg, but I can get back on track if I set my mind to it, yet I can't seem to do that.

I feel like I'm going to die right now and I'm in pain.

This is a comment with such content. Let's discuss it in detail.

So, I've stopped binge eating and I have no issues with appetite control.

It means that mind control is not possible.

There may be some people who do not fully understand this situation.

There are just differences in degree, but there are quite a few people who share similar concerns.

I am doing well with my diet, but I feel anxious because I don't know when I might binge eat.

I have successfully lost weight and am maintaining it well, but...

The thought that a yo-yo effect could occur doesn't leave my mind.

The reason this happens is that we turn away from and avoid the results.

If you have been on a diet and then ended up binge eating, resulting in a yo-yo effect,

There is always a reason that leads to binge eating.

We need to find the cause of the binge eating and address it.

For example, if you followed an extremely restrictive diet and then ended up binge eating as a reaction to it,

I need to change my diet method.

However, I don't want to think about the difficult diet again.

There are times when we blame ourselves for failing at dieting and try to escape.

When you fall into self-blame like this, two problems arise.

The first is that I keep failing at dieting as the same thing keeps happening.

The second point is that the memories of failing at dieting do not fade away and accumulate.

We carry out various tasks as we go through life.

The result of completing that task is not always success.

There are many more cases of failure.

When the result is failure

Accepting the result without turning away from it.

By analyzing the causes of failure, we can avoid repeating the same mistakes.

Next time, the chances of success will increase.

If you experience enough failures, you increase the chances of success.

Then, inevitably, you will succeed.

This is why failure is sometimes referred to as the mother of success.

Accepting the results without turning away from them, analyzing them, and making improvements to get better.

You need to proceed this far for the task to be completed.

If you fail while carrying out a task,

If you hate that failure so much and turn away, avoid it, and run away,

The cause of failure becomes unclear, and the same problem leads to repeated failures.

It keeps repeating because you stopped in the middle without completing the task.

It is the same when you binge eat while dieting and experience a rebound effect.

I hate the result of binge eating and experiencing a yo-yo effect, which led to my failure in dieting.

If you escape by blaming and criticizing yourself, the same thing will happen again.

I can't understand why I binge eat, so I end up binge eating again and failing at my diet.

In reality, there are quite a few people who repeatedly attempt to lose weight using the same methods and fail.

I was on a starvation diet, but I reached my limit and ended up binge eating, which led to my failure.

Next time, I might try dieting by starving myself again.

If you diet with an extreme diet plan,

I know that when the diet ends and I stop following the meal plan, I will gain weight again.

You keep repeating the process of dieting, gaining weight, and then dieting again.

The bigger problem is that the memories of failed diets do not fade away and continue to accumulate.

Divided into two groups, A and B, and then proceeded with various tasks.

Group A should complete the task without interruptions before proceeding to the next task.

Group B interferes with the completion of the task.

I requested to start the next assignment before finishing the one I was working on.

After finishing all the assignments, I checked how much I remembered about the tasks I had completed.

Group A remembered 32% of the tasks.

Group B remembered 68% of the tasks.

There is about a twofold difference.

So if you don't complete the task you were working on and stop halfway through,

It means that it won't be easily forgotten.

This is called the Zeigarnik effect or the incomplete effect.

The Zeigarnik effect is positively utilized in various fields, but

It can also be a cause that makes it difficult to forget trauma and keeps bringing it to mind.

When you binge eat while dieting and experience a rebound effect.

If you escape by blaming and criticizing yourself,

The Zeigarnik effect makes it memorable and keeps it coming to mind.

My lack of willpower leads me to binge eat, and the memory of experiencing yo-yo dieting keeps coming back to me.

If you repeatedly fail at dieting, and these memories do not fade but continue to accumulate,

It becomes a problem when you start to feel psychologically anxious like the person in the story.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First, as we go through life, we undertake various tasks, and we often fail much more frequently.

The second human, when the result was failure,

Because we accepted the results without ignoring them and developed through analysis and improvement.

If you turn away from the results and run away,

I recognize that the assignment is not finished yet.

To finish the assignment, I can't help but keep thinking about it.

This is called the Zeigarnik effect.

When I failed at my third diet.

If you escape by blaming and criticizing yourself,

The Zeigarnik effect causes us to not forget and to keep recalling things.

This can lead to ongoing anxiety, restlessness, and fear, resulting in psychological issues.

I can organize it like this.

When you fail at dieting

I hope you don't blame or criticize yourself.

No one succeeds in dieting all at once without any failures.

Everyone experiences failure.

I improved my dieting method and achieved success.

If you feel psychologically anxious due to memories of failed dieting,

Think about what methods you used to diet and why you failed.

You can change your diet method to prevent the same problem from occurring.

That way, it will come to an end and be forgotten from memory.

You can avoid failing at dieting again with the same problem.

The advice not to blame oneself is really good.

The reason for becoming obese is eating a lot, and to lose weight, you need to eat less, right?

So in the end, even if you want to eat, you have to hold back.

Isn't it my fault for not being able to resist eating this?

How are you suggesting to improve this?

The food we eat affects our bodies, and this can lead to cravings.

A desire to eat so much that it leads to obesity.

It's not the appetite I was born with.

It could be that my appetite is influenced by the food I eat.

Changing the types of food you eat can help normalize your appetite.

If you normalize your appetite, you can diet without having to resist the foods you want to eat.

I previously explained the principles of dieting and talked about this part in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click here to see it.

Changing the types of food you eat ultimately means you should follow a diet plan, right?

If I eat a diet plan, I can lose weight, but I don't have the confidence to eat that way for the rest of my life.

You don't have to eat it for the rest of your life.

The reason for changing the types of food you eat is

It's to create a body that allows me to eat what I want without gaining weight.

I made a video before because the same question came up.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

After doing extreme dieting, my basal metabolic rate decreased, and I experienced a rebound with binge eating.

I didn't used to eat a lot of snacks.

Since the yo-yo came, I've come to love snacks too much.

I sometimes skip meals to eat snacks.

Even if I try to stick to a diet, I just can't give up snacks.

What should someone like me do?

This is the most typical case of someone who had problems after following an extreme diet.

A subscriber who is a flight attendant shared their concerns with the same issue, so I made a video about it.

I think that video will be helpful for you.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

Do I need to exercise to lose weight?

Honestly, I don't have the confidence to exercise for a lifetime.

There is a saying that if you stop exercising, it can lead to a yo-yo effect.

What do you think about this?

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the bottom right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
