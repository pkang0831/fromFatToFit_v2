I'm working hard on my diet and exercising diligently, but...

I received a story about not being able to sleep properly, so I want to talk about it.

First, let's read the content of the story.

I am a woman who is 170 cm tall and weighs 64 kg.

After trying the long-term diet, I found it really amazing that my appetite decreased and I no longer felt hungry.

People around me say that I've lost so much weight that my body looks noticeably better.

I start work at 5 PM and finish at midnight.

For lunch, I filled a bowl of black rice with a variety of side dishes at a Korean buffet.

In the evening, 24 almonds and a salad.

I am making and eating kimchi fried rice with 140g of chicken breast, 200g of kimchi, and 110g of oat konjac rice.

Exercise strength training for 1 hour, 4 to 5 times a week.

I do aerobic exercise at a high intensity that makes me sweat a lot for about 1 to 2 hours, twice a week.

However, I'm so tired that I go to sleep around midnight to 1 AM, but I wake up around 4 AM.

I feel exhausted and want to keep sleeping, but I keep waking up every hour.

In the end, I give up on sleep at 8 o'clock and start my activities.

I'm really worried because my dark circles are very severe and I feel drained of energy.

This is a story about "Why is this happening?"

Let's talk in detail.

To conclude, it is highly likely that a lack of carbohydrates is the cause.

A typical symptom of carbohydrate deficiency is insomnia.

The carbohydrates we eat are converted into glucose in the body.

Some of this glucose is stored as glycogen.

When you exercise, this glycogen is used as energy.

As muscle mass increases, the total amount of glycogen that can be stored also increases.

If you use up a lot of glycogen from exercising a lot, there will be a need to replenish it.

Because of this, people who consistently exercise and have a lot of muscle mass and physical activity are...

People who do not exercise need more carbohydrates than those who do.

Looking at the details, it involves 1 hour of strength training 4 to 5 times a week.

It says that you do 1 to 2 hours of aerobic exercise twice a week.

If combined, it means I am exercising 6 to 7 days a week.

While there is no information about what kind of exercise is being done and at what intensity,

If you are exercising properly, your amount of exercise is quite significant.

This will increase the amount of carbohydrates needed.

If you do not provide the necessary carbohydrates, symptoms such as insomnia may occur.

Looking at the diet, it says that for lunch, one bowl of black rice is consumed, and for dinner, 110g of oat konjac rice is eaten.

Considering that a typical serving of rice is 200g,

The amount of oat konjac rice eaten for dinner is about half of what we typically eat.

Most of that half is konjac rice.

What is konjac rice?

It is a product made from konjac shaped like rice, and most of it is made of water.

In fact, 95-97% of it is made up of water.

Oat konjac rice is a product made by mixing oats with konjac rice to make it easier to eat.

There are differences depending on the manufacturer.

Compared to white rice, it has about half the carbohydrate content.

So, compared to 200g of white rice

I am eating about 110g of oat konjac rice, which has half the carbohydrate content.

The amount of carbohydrates in oat konjac rice is about 1/4 of that in 200g of white rice.

If you look at the nutritional information for the 110g oat konjac rice product,

You can see that the carbohydrate content is only about 17g.

It says that I am eating 24 almonds, but don't almonds have a high carbohydrate content?

The carbohydrate content of almonds is about 20% of the total.

Since the amount eaten is very small, the carbohydrates obtained from almonds are not in large quantities.

Looking at the nutritional components of almonds, the carbohydrate content is 22g per 100g.

The weight of a single almond is approximately 1 to 2 grams.

Assuming an average of 1.5g, 24 pills would be 36g.

Since 22% of 36g is carbohydrates, it's approximately 8g.

However, if we take another look at the nutritional components of almonds,

Out of the 22g of carbohydrates, 12g is dietary fiber that is not digested or absorbed.

So, more than half of the carbohydrates in almonds are carbohydrates that are not digested or absorbed.

Among the foods eaten for dinner, excluding almonds and oat konjac rice.

I have leftover kimchi and salad.

These vegetables have a carbohydrate content of about 5%.

Some of this 5% is dietary fiber that is not digested or absorbed.

Moreover, dietary fiber itself hinders digestion and absorption, which prevents the absorption of carbohydrates.

The actual amount of carbohydrates absorbed by the body is much lower than the calculations suggest.

If you are eating so few carbohydrates at dinner,

The black rice served for lunch may not be equivalent to a typical serving size.

The various side dishes that are being enjoyed abundantly.

There is a possibility that you are mainly eating side dishes with low carbohydrate content.

Isn't it the case that we eat abundantly for lunch and a bit insufficiently for dinner?

There is a possibility of that, but...

Even so, carbohydrates are quite insufficient compared to the amount of exercise.

The amount I eat for dinner is too small.

So, how many grams of carbohydrates should I eat in a day?

I need to eat according to my body's reactions.

The amount of carbohydrates needed in the first place is

It varies depending on whether you exercise or not.

Even if you exercise, it's important to know what kind of exercise you are doing.

It depends on the amount of muscle mass.

In simple terms, if you have symptoms of carbohydrate deficiency, you need to eat more carbohydrates.

What symptoms occur when there is a deficiency of carbohydrates?

Insomnia can occur, making it difficult to get a good night's sleep.

You may often experience headaches or dizziness.

I have been getting more irritable and often losing my temper.

If you experience symptoms of body aches or a cold.

I am experiencing severe fatigue because my tiredness is not recovering.

You may experience a lack of energy and lethargy.

Experiencing constipation that makes it difficult to go to the bathroom.

Even though I am exercising, I sometimes experience muscle loss, which leads to a decrease in muscle mass.

You may experience bad breath symptoms.

Not everyone experiences these symptoms just because they are lacking carbohydrates.

The symptoms vary depending on the person.

The more symptoms appear, the more we can conclude that there is a lack of carbohydrates.

In the actual story, the person sharing their experience has insomnia, fatigue, and lethargy.

Just by looking at this, you can tell that there is a lack of carbohydrates.

You didn't mention it in your story, but there are probably other symptoms as well.

If you have these symptoms, it is a sign that you are lacking carbohydrates.

Increase the amount of carbohydrate foods or

You need to switch to foods that are high in carbohydrate density.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

The first carbohydrates we eat are converted into glucose in the body.

This glucose is stored in the form of glycogen.

With consistent exercise, as muscle mass increases, the total amount of glycogen that can be stored also increases.

If you deplete a lot of glycogen through exercise, you need to replenish the glycogen that has been used up.

If you exercise regularly, the amount of carbohydrates you need will increase.

If the third carbohydrate is insufficient,

Symptoms such as insomnia, headaches, dizziness, irritability, fatigue, lethargy, constipation, muscle loss, and bad breath occur.

If you have these symptoms,

Intentionally increase carbohydrate intake to see if the symptoms disappear.

If the symptoms disappear, it means that there was a lack of carbohydrates.

You need to increase carbohydrates in your diet.

I can organize it like this.

It's something I always say, but everyone is different.

Muscle mass and body fat mass are different.

Even if you exercise, the types and intensities of the exercise vary.

Even if you eat the same food, the degree of digestion and absorption varies because the digestive systems are different.

The amount of carbohydrates my body needs should not be sought elsewhere.

I need to observe my body's reactions and find out.

I studied dieting hard and created a perfect meal plan, but...

I have insomnia, feel tired, and my body hurts. Why is this happening?

This is not how you should think.

When you have insomnia, feel tired, and your body hurts.

The diet I am currently following means that it is not suitable for my body.

You need to make changes to your diet. You should think of it this way.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

The person sharing their story said that when they followed the longa diet, their appetite really decreased and they were able to lose weight.

What is the Longo diet?

In the past, I explained the principles of dieting and talked about how to create a meal plan.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

I understand that exercising requires more carbohydrates...

When I actually try to eat more carbohydrates,

I'm worried that I might gain weight after eating or that I might binge eat because I can't control myself.

Even if you realize that there is a lack of carbohydrates for that reason,

There are quite a few people who do not eat carbohydrates well.

However, that can also make it difficult to lose weight.

I previously had a similar question come up, so I made a detailed response video.

I think that video will be helpful for you.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

I've heard that eating vinegar is good for dieting.

Please tell me a bit about vinegar.

This was also a question that came up before, and we covered it in detail as a series.

The reason vinegar is said to be good for dieting.

There are various types of vinegar, but which one is good?

What is the difference between people who have seen weight loss effects from vinegar and those who have not?

I explained it in detail through several videos.

I will make sure to have the series videos appear in the bottom left.

I can follow a diet and exercise if I'm told to, but I just can't quit drinking.

Can you tell me a bit about alcohol?

Alcohol does have calories, but

There is a saying that it doesn't get stored as body fat, so you don't gain weight.

There is a saying that if you drink alcohol instead of eating rice, you can lose weight.

They say that most alcoholics who drink without eating anything because of that are thin.

Is this really true?

This was also a question that came up before, and we discussed it in detail as a series.

I will make sure to have the series videos appear in the bottom right.
