The topic of this video is about acknowledging one's own mistakes.

Recently, there are many people both online and offline who do not acknowledge their mistakes.

It's not my fault. It's a problem with the system. It's an institutional issue. It's someone else's fault.

There are people who shift the responsibility like this.

Yeah, it's my fault, but that person is worse than me. Why don't you say anything to them?

This is how it ends up being a case of mutual exchange.

But I also have my faults, and if there is someone who has made a bigger mistake than I have, then...

This person made a big mistake, and I made a mistake too, so both of us are at fault, right?

But why do you say it as if it's unfair only to me?

I thought about why people do not acknowledge their own mistakes.

Korea is such a highly competitive society.

I have a fear that admitting my mistakes will lead to losing in competition.

However, after thinking and reflecting on it,

It's a fear that comes from the unconscious. In reality, acknowledging my mistakes doesn't lead to defeat.

I will talk about this part.

There is a writer named Jo Seung-yeon who appears frequently on TV.

In the past, I gave a lecture titled "A Leader Who Knows How to Lose."

In that lecture, there will be a discussion about fencing.

I heard that you learned fencing during your college years.

These days, fencing equipment has improved so much that when a valid hit occurs,

The bell rang and the lights turned on, making it possible to check immediately.

Fencing is a form of swordsmanship that has existed for a long time.

In the past, there was no such equipment.

At that time, they said the scoring was done by a touch.

Because the fencing sword is so fast, even with a referee present,

It's hard to tell right now whether the attack is effective or not.

It's hard to even understand the player who attacked.

Among the people present, only one person knows for sure whether it was a valid shot or not.

Who is the person stabbed with a knife?

My stomach was stabbed very painfully, or my stomach was stabbed but it didn't hurt.

You can know this accurately yourself, right?

I was definitely stabbed with a critical hit. If this is a valid hit, then I declare a two-shot.

I am declaring that I have been stabbed.

I just couldn't avoid the attack, couldn't block it, and got hurt because of my lack of skill.

It is a declaration to give victory to the opponent.

From now on, it will serve as an opportunity to work hard and avoid making a two-she declaration.

So it's about acknowledging one's failures, mistakes, and defeats, and using them as a foundation for growth.

The content of this lecture has been captured and spread widely on the internet.

Recognizing your shortcomings after seeing this will provide an opportunity for improvement.

On the contrary, a person who does not acknowledge their shortcomings by not giving a touché is someone who...

There are some people who accept that it's not possible to improve one's skills.

On the contrary, there are those who accept it by saying, "That's not true. It's just a theoretical discussion."

As mentioned earlier, South Korea is a truly competitive society.

If you declare a two-touch, you can improve your skills, but in the end, you still lose in the match.

Therefore, making a two-she declaration may be right in terms of the ultimate goal, but...

In a competitive society, I often hear people say that it's not a good choice.

What was unfortunate about this reaction was that it was due to a small part that was exposed above the water.

I feel like we might be missing the really big part that's in the water.

Why did we have a fencing practice match?

We don't play practice games to win practice games.

In order to actually improve my fencing skills and use them effectively in practice.

It is a martial art that is learned to protect my life from the opponent and to defeat the opponent.

If I don't declare a touché, I can continue to win in the mock match, which is just a small part outside the water.

In mock competitions, I am undefeated, but my skills are not improving.

In a real situation, one could lose their life due to a lack of skill.

A large part hidden underwater.

To protect my life and to defeat my opponent.

I gave up on the part of improving my skills that I actually needed to enhance.

While seeking victory in a mock battle, which is just a small part outside the water, one ends up suffering significant losses.

Even if we talk like this, there are still people who hold opposing views.

Your story might be true in fencing.

However, in Korea, it is a competitive society, and losing comes with tremendous losses.

There are people who try to take advantage of me when I suffer a loss.

"Are you saying I should admit defeat in that situation? Is that really the right thing to do?"

However, I think we need to examine whether that is really the case.

To summarize the views of those who hold opposing opinions,

When I acknowledge a mistake, it leads to a loss as a result.

But in reality, that's not the order. The order should be reversed.

If we take the fencing example mentioned earlier again,

What is the damage that occurred there?

Being stabbed is a loss.

I lost in the mock battle because I was stabbed with a knife.

Because I was stabbed with a knife, I lose in real combat.

If I declare a touche, will I get stabbed?

That's not it. I'm declaring a touche because I was stabbed with a knife.

The order is completely reversed.

The same applies to other examples as well.

After I failed to get a job, then...

What did I prepare incorrectly? What should I have done more? This is a form of self-reflection.

I started a store, but after it failed...

Am I conducting market research incorrectly? Am I managing the store poorly? This is a moment of self-reflection.

That's right? The order is like this.

The reason people get the order mixed up is that

It's because of the criticism from the people behind me.

Korea is a society that pays a lot of attention to how others perceive them.

I pay a lot of attention to my reputation.

So, if I acknowledge a loss after it occurs,

People will see it and curse; I really hate that.

I feel that this is greater than the actual loss.

So I think that if I don't acknowledge it, criticism won't follow, right?

This is how it goes in order.

However, when you actually think about it, criticism still follows even without self-reflection.

My store has gone bankrupt.

Whether I reflect on myself or not, people will say something when they see my store fail.

I failed to get a job.

Whether I reflect on it or not, it will inevitably become a topic of gossip among people.

Whether or not you engage in self-reflection has no impact on these two cards.

These two are fixed.

By reflecting on myself, I realize my shortcomings and ensure that the same thing doesn't happen next time.

It's a choice between not reflecting on oneself and allowing the same thing to happen repeatedly.

Then there’s no reason not to do it. So, it means we must reflect on ourselves unconditionally.

There is no benefit at all from not engaging in self-reflection.

And one more thing I would like to mention is

I hope you don't pay too much attention to the opinions of those around you.

In the movie Oldboy, there is a line that goes like this.

Smile.

The whole world will laugh with you.

Cry.

You will be the only one to cry.

What this means is

When I achieve great success in life and have significant profits,

People gather around to share the profits, and they will laugh together.

So the whole world ends up laughing with me.

If I experience defeat in life and have no gains in hand,

It's a story about crying alone because there is no one around.

When I experience defeat at some moment in my life,

People don't keep cursing it. No one cares.

At first, they might say something like, "I knew it would be like this."

But that's just for a moment.

In the end, a person is ultimately the most important to themselves.

People tend to gravitate towards those who can bring them benefits, so they pay more attention to such individuals.

So when I said I experienced moments of defeat in my life,

Just because I acknowledge that.

My losses are neither increasing nor decreasing.

Acknowledging that does not mean that...

The people around me don't insult me more or for a longer time.

It's not that I don't curse.

So don't just brush off the moments of defeat in life.

I think it would be better to use this as a foundation to move my life in a more positive direction.
