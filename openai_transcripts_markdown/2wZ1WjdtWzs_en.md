The topic of this video is

The reason is that dieting by starving or following a low-calorie diet is unfair.

For those who are on a starvation diet or a low-calorie diet,

Basically, you have the calorie theory as a foundation.

What this means is based on the ratio of calorie intake to calorie expenditure.

It means that a person's obesity and diet are determined.

When the calorie intake is greater than the calorie expenditure,

Excess calories that remain are converted into fat.

This accumulates as body fat and leads to obesity.

Conversely, when the calorie intake is lower than the calorie expenditure,

It means that because you are removing the amount that is lacking from your body, you are able to lose weight.

It is a very famous diet theory.

There are many people who believe that this is the truth.

However, the human body strives to maintain its current state.

Because there is a property called homeostasis

Eating a lot of food doesn't necessarily mean you'll gain weight.

Eating less food does not necessarily mean you will lose weight.

If the calorie intake is too low, it can lead to a decrease in the basal metabolic rate.

I am trying to reduce my energy consumption to maintain my current weight.

If the calories consumed are too high,

A way to not absorb all the energy from food.

I am trying to maintain my current weight.

When a person eats food and it gets digested, it comes out as poop.

The reason it can be used as fertilizer for plants is that

It's because there are nutrients left in the poop.

In reality, a person absorbs the nutrients from the food they have eaten.

It means that not all of it can be absorbed 100%.

A person cannot absorb 100% of the food they consume.

The human body has homeostasis.

Combining these two things creates what is known as the absorption rate theory.

This is very interesting.

What it means is that a person can absorb a certain percentage of the food they have eaten.

This percentage is not fixed; it increases when you eat less food.

It means that if you eat a lot of food, you will gain weight.

Then a question arises here.

If you eat a lot of food, the absorption rate decreases, so if you want to maintain your current weight, that’s correct.

Why is there so much obesity in modern society?

These days, many people are finding the cause in excessive carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates are essential nutrients for our body.

It is important to eat an appropriate amount.

The problem is too many excess carbohydrates.

When carbohydrates enter the human body, they are converted into glucose and used as energy.

This glucose spreads throughout the body via the blood.

However, if the concentration of glucose in the blood increases too much, it can cause inflammation in the blood vessel walls.

To prevent this, glucose in the blood is converted into fat and stored in fat cells.

However, another problem arises here.

The reason we eat food is to obtain energy from it and use that energy.

The energy from the food we just ate has been converted into fat and stored.

Well, it's because I don't have any energy right now, and I'm getting bored and hungry.

So that's why we end up eating snacks like chips.

Most snacks and treats are made up of carbohydrates.

So, going through the same process again, body fat accumulates once more.

This keeps repeating and eventually leads to obesity.

It's not that eating snacks causes body fat to accumulate and leads to obesity.

The reason you want to eat snacks in the first place is that you are consuming excess carbohydrates.

If you actually manage to control your carbohydrate intake so that you don't eat too much,

The desire to overeat or eat snacks decreases significantly.

Then, there is no increase in body fat due to the concentration of glucose in the blood vessels.

It means that even if you eat enough food, you won't become obese.

For example, a person who consumes 1200 kcal with an absorption rate of 90% is

The actual calories absorbed by the body is 1080 kcal.

However, a person on a 1600 kcal diet with an absorption rate of 70% would...

The calories coming into the body are 1120 kcal.

The calorie intake is 400 kcal, but there is a difference.

The difference in calories absorbed by the body is only 40 kcal.

Of course, there is no exact way to determine the absorption rate in the human body.

However, if a person eats less food, they do so for survival.

I will try to absorb as much energy as possible from that food.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the absorption rate will increase.

If you follow a low-calorie diet here, as everyone knows, your basal metabolic rate will decrease.

It becomes increasingly difficult to diet, and it becomes easy to gain weight.

However, it's not possible for a person to live their whole life without overeating. There are occasions like drinking parties that can happen.

If you go on a trip, you should try all the local food, right?

In such situations, it is natural to consume a lot of carbohydrates.

In the case of people with high absorption rates, they tend to absorb a lot of carbohydrates.

The concentration of glucose in the blood increases significantly.

Therefore, body fat will likely increase significantly.

On the contrary, a person with a low absorption rate, even if they eat the same amount of food,

Absorbing a small amount of carbohydrates leads to a minimal increase in the glucose concentration in the blood.

So it means that body fat also increases less.

However, once you get to this point, a question arises.

Yes, I fully understand what you have said so far.

I understand that eating a lot doesn't necessarily mean gaining weight.

I understand that eating less doesn't necessarily mean it's good for dieting.

However, if you consume all the necessary calories your body needs without feeling hungry,

So my body fat doesn't need to be burned right now, right?

Then you might be wondering, when exactly should I go on a diet?

It's a very obvious question.

What is being discussed here is the theory of cell division.

The human body is made up of countless cells, and

This cell is involved in the death and elimination of old cells.

New cells are constantly being created through repeated division.

Usually, if we get seriously injured somewhere and do not receive treatment,

Some people think that my body now is the same as it was a year ago.

Because the cells are constantly changing, it means that the body is not the same.

In reality, in the case of human skin, the cells change little by little every day.

After about four weeks, the skin cells throughout the entire body will be replaced with new ones.

In the case of bones, all bones are replaced with new ones in about 7 years.

And this applies directly to muscle and fat cells as well.

However, there's something interesting here.

As time passes, it is natural for old cells to be created.

Then extinction is bound to occur.

If you consider whether cell division occurs unconditionally, the answer is no.

For example, I worked really hard on my exercise and built a significant amount of muscle in my body.

However, if you have to take a break from exercising for a certain period due to circumstances,

The amount of muscle in my body is gradually decreasing. This means that muscle loss is occurring.

However, the muscle loss that we commonly know is

When dieting to the point of not meeting your basal metabolic rate, or when following a low-calorie diet,

Muscle mass decreases because the body breaks down muscle for energy.

You know that this is muscle loss, right?

However, even if you eat a lot of food, muscle loss can still occur.

So when I looked into why that is,

The muscle cells have aged and died.

I was trying to observe the division that creates new muscle cells.

I am not exercising right now.

Therefore, such large muscles are not necessary.

So, cell division does occur, but it doesn't happen in the same amount.

A small amount of cell division occurs, resulting in a decrease in muscle mass.

This applies the same way to local areas as well.

The very good news is that the body fat accumulated in our bodies is not something we stored because our bodies needed it.

We are not unable to eat or starving; it's not that we have stockpiled emergency food supplies.

Eating too many carbohydrates increases the concentration of glucose in the blood.

To lower this, it was a makeshift solution to change it to fat and stack it up.

I'm saying that I didn't store it up because I needed fat.

So every day, a certain amount of fat cells die off.

It means that the same amount of fat cells does not just appear.

A person's daily metabolic rate consists of three components: basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate.

As everyone knows, the basal metabolic rate is the energy consumed by the body's internal organs to maintain life.

The active metabolic rate refers to the energy used in all situations where we move.

I wake up in the morning, take a shower, go to work, do my tasks, go out for lunch, and come home after work.

This refers to the energy expended during such everyday activities.

In the case of general office jobs, it is said that the activity metabolism accounts for about 30% of the basal metabolic rate.

In the case of exercise metabolic rate, it refers to the energy expended during physical activity.

Well, there are some people who don't exercise and some who can't due to circumstances, so let's exclude this.

If we only talk about basal metabolic rate and activity metabolic rate,

The activity metabolic rate of a person with a basal metabolic rate of 1600 kcal is 30%.

It's about 480 kcal.

So, the combined daily caloric expenditure of these two would be around 2080 kcal.

However, if I eat about 1600 kcal a day, I don't feel hungry.

Clearly, the absorption rate is not 100% at the front.

Even if you have a 1600 kcal meal, what actually enters your body is likely only about 80-90%.

If we assume that about 80% has been absorbed, that means 1280 kcal has been absorbed.

When compared to the 2000 kcal needed in a day,

You're missing 800 kcal a day.

So what happened then? I wondered why I wasn't hungry.

That 800 kcal comes from the energy released by the dead fat cells.

Of course, I mentioned this earlier, but since the absorption rate cannot be determined precisely,

The absorption rate may be higher, and the amount of fat cells that die may be lower.

On the contrary, the absorption rate may be lower, and the amount of fat cells that die may be greater.

Regardless of how things turn out, what’s important is that even if I have enough meals so that I’m not hungry,

What's more important is that body fat can gradually decrease.

And the really sad story is

In cases where I am on a starvation diet or consuming low-calorie meals,

My body is in a situation where I can't eat well right now.

The body fat in my body is needed as emergency food.

It is an act of continuous recognition.

Then, you will try to fill in the amount of dying fat cells through cell division, right?

So, even if you just stay still, the body fat that used to decrease will actually stop decreasing.

So from the beginning to the end of the video.

When I listed the disadvantages of following a low-calorie diet or starving myself, I found several points.

Because this is too big, rather than that diet,

Isn't it better to have a diet that allows you to eat well?

Sounds plausible, right?
