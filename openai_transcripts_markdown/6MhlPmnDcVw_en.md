The Strange Aspects of Foods High in Satiety That Are Good for Weight Loss - Satiety Part 2

Hello, this is pkang.

I want to lose weight, but I eat too much food.

This is the second video about satiety, as I've seen many comments on this topic.

In the first part of the video, I talked about eating habits that can lead to overeating without us even realizing it.

If you're curious about the content of Part 1 of the video, you can click the link in the top right to watch it.

In this video, I would like to talk about the feeling of fullness that arises from the composition of the diet.

If you are someone interested in dieting,

You may have heard about foods that provide a feeling of fullness.

A typical example is leafy vegetables.

Vegetables are low in calories but have a large volume, so they provide a feeling of fullness when eaten.

So, if you create a diet focused on vegetables,

You can easily diet because you can eat until you're full while still being low in calories.

There are many cases where such stories are told.

In summary, the factor that provides a feeling of fullness is the volume of the food.

That's why foods like leafy greens and konjac are called diet foods.

However, if this information is correct, there is something that cannot be explained.

This is bulletproof coffee.

Bulletproof coffee refers to coffee that has butter and oil added to it, resulting in a high-calorie beverage.

There is talk that this bulletproof coffee helps with dieting because it provides a feeling of fullness.

People who have actually consumed bulletproof coffee experience a feeling of fullness.

But... something seems off, right?

Bulletproof coffee contains butter and oil, so it is high in calories, but

Since it's just a cup of coffee, I can't say that it has a large volume.

If the factor that provides a feeling of fullness is the volume of food, then it doesn't make sense to achieve fullness with bulletproof coffee.

Then, is it the calorie content rather than the volume of food that contributes to the feeling of fullness?

If that's the case, it doesn't make sense to feel full from low-calorie foods like leafy greens or konjac.

Does feeling full occur if either the volume or calories is high?

You might think that way, but that's not entirely correct.

Because protein also provides a feeling of fullness.

If you are someone interested in dieting,

You have probably heard a lot about how protein provides a feeling of fullness.

This is why high-protein chicken breast salad is often used in diet plans.

So, it is said that the volume, calories, and protein of food all contribute to a feeling of fullness.

It actually has a satiating effect.

However, if we organize the terms, we can discover an interesting fact.

The reason bulletproof coffee provides a feeling of fullness is said to be because it contains calories, but...

The reason bulletproof coffee is high in calories is that it contains fats like butter or oil.

So, calories can be converted into fat.

And foods like leafy vegetables are actually carbohydrate foods.

Leafy vegetables do not contain protein and fat.

If it's a carbohydrate food made through processing, it doesn't necessarily have to be large in volume.

If we consider unprocessed foods, most carbohydrate foods are bulky.

So, here, foods with a large volume can be converted into carbohydrates.

In the end, it means that carbohydrates, fats, and proteins all provide a sense of fullness.

Individually, they didn't seem strange, but when you put them together, they do seem odd.

Because this means that no matter what food you eat, you will feel full.

Any food will contain at least one of carbohydrates, fats, or proteins.

In a video I recently made, I used the term "false hunger" quite a bit.

Perhaps because of that, an interesting comment was posted.

Is it possible to have false feelings of fullness?

For example, due to indigestible substances like dietary fiber.

I wonder if you feel full even though your body needs nutrients.

That's an interesting question, isn't it?

To answer your question, there is a similar phenomenon.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video,

Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins all have the effect of providing a feeling of fullness.

You don't have to eat everything; you can feel full by eating just one.

So, even if you only eat carbohydrates without fats or proteins, you still feel full.

You can feel full by eating only fats without consuming carbohydrates and proteins.

You can feel full by eating only protein without consuming carbohydrates or fats.

So, they say that just eating leafy greens can provide a feeling of fullness.

They say that drinking bulletproof coffee gives a feeling of fullness.

It means that even when eating chicken breast, there is a feeling of fullness.

However, since carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are all essential nutrients for humans,

When you follow a diet that restricts certain nutrients, your body recognizes that it is lacking those nutrients.

And to fill in the lacking nutrients, a feeling of hunger arises.

For example, by consuming a sufficient amount of fat to achieve a feeling of fullness.

If you experience hunger due to a lack of carbohydrates at the same time,

It's a strange phenomenon where you feel full but still want to eat.

It causes confusion in the appetite system.

So we can call this false fullness.

In the next video, we will discuss the problems that arise from false fullness.

And I will talk about how to solve it.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to display the next video on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not the third part of the satiety video.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few days.
