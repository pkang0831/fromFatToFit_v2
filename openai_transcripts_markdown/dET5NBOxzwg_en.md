Does drinking a lot of water at once put a strain on the kidneys?

Since we're on the topic of water, let's discuss it in detail.

First, to answer your question, there are some differences depending on the reference point.

First of all, there is a claim that drinking a lot of water at once is not good for the kidneys, as mentioned in the question.

On the contrary, there is also the argument that since the kidneys process a large amount of water each day, 500ml is not a problem.

At first glance, these two claims seem to be opposing arguments, so it appears that one is right and the other is wrong, but

In reality, both are correct; they just have different reference points.

First of all, there is a limit to the amount of moisture that the body can absorb at one time.

Drinking a large amount of water at once does not mean that all of it is absorbed.

It is absorbed up to the limit of absorption, and the rest is not absorbed and is excreted.

For example, if we assume that the amount of moisture that can be absorbed at one time is 20,

When you drink 50 units of water, 20 units are absorbed and the remaining 30 units are expelled.

The water of 30 here simply passes through the kidneys without any significance.

However, the amount of water processed by the kidneys in a day is much greater.

Drinking a large amount of water just once does not immediately put a strain on the kidneys.

However, if it continues to repeat, the story is different.

Assuming that the amount of water needed for the body in a day is 100.

If the amount of water that can be absorbed at once is 20, then you need to drink a total of 5 times.

What will happen if I drink 50 units of water every time I drink?

The 30 units of water that are not absorbed are excreted, and the kidneys end up doing work that they don't need to do.

The burden this places on the kidneys is minimal, but...

If you repeat it several times a day for a month, a year, five years, or ten years, it will put a strain on your kidneys.

So sometimes drinking a lot of water at once does not put a strain on the kidneys.

However, if you have a habit of drinking a lot of water every time you drink,

Drinking a lot of water is said to be good for health, but continuously drinking excessive amounts of water can become a problem.

I heard that drinking a lot of water is good for your health, isn't it?

The reason why it is said that we should drink a lot of water is due to the body's water consumption.

The human body continuously loses water through urine, feces, sweat, saliva, and skin.

When I calculated the amount of moisture consumed this way, it turned out to be approximately 2 liters per day.

So, the idea came up that you should drink 8 cups of water a day using a 250ml cup.

However, most people do not drink that much water every day.

In that case, your body will become dehydrated, and you will feel thirsty and need to drink water.

In reality, there were many times when I didn't feel thirsty.

So modern people are chronically dehydrated. They need to drink water before they feel thirsty.

Such stories have started to emerge.

First of all, it is correct that the amount of water lost in a day is 2 liters.

However, it is not necessary to drink 2 liters of water or more every day.

Because there are ways to obtain moisture other than just drinking water.

First of all, the food we eat also contains moisture.

When you think of the most commonly eaten rice, you add a similar amount of water to the rice to cook it.

Not only rice, but vegetables and fruits also contain moisture, and meat has moisture in the form of juices.

Even instant food that you heat in the microwave contains moisture.

You can obtain hydration through coffee and tea, and water is also produced as body fat is burned.

Drinking 2 liters or more of water a day cannot be considered universally healthy.

I drink a lot of water and my skin has improved. Isn't drinking a lot of water good?

Digesting and quickly absorbing processed foods can lead to an increase in body fat and negatively affect the skin.

If you drink a lot of water, your stomach will fill up with water, and your food intake will decrease.

When the amount of food intake decreases, the consumption of processed foods also decreases.

As a result, body fat decreases, weight loss occurs, and skin improves.

Utilizing this point, drink a cup of water before meals or

There is also a method of eating where you take a spoonful of rice and drink a little water each time.

So, when you drink a lot of water, there is a phenomenon where your skin improves.

As explained in the video, just drinking a lot of water doesn't mean that all of it gets absorbed.

It's not that drinking water causes that effect.

The effect is due to reducing the intake of refined foods because the stomach is filled with water.

To put it differently, even if you don't drink a lot of water,

If you reduce your intake of processed foods, you will notice an improvement in your skin.

Most diets, healthy eating plans, or meal methods include a reduction in the intake of refined foods.

When looking at reviews of such diets or eating methods, there are many mentions of improved skin.

I heard that coffee and tea have diuretic effects, so you shouldn't drink them and should only drink water. Is that not true?

It is true that coffee and tea have diuretic effects, so drinking them leads to the expulsion of fluids.

In reality, drinking coffee and tea can lead to the urge to go to the bathroom.

However, the amount of moisture expelled is not greater than the amount of moisture consumed.

For example, to obtain the amount of moisture equivalent to 2 cups of water, you can simply drink 2 cups of water.

You can think of it as needing to drink 3 cups of coffee to obtain the hydration equivalent of 2 cups.

So, while there is water loss due to diuretic effects, it is not impossible to obtain water.

But why do they say that you must drink water instead of coffee?

You should drink 8 glasses of water a day. To get 2 glasses of water, you need to drink 3 cups of coffee.

If we connect these two arguments and think about them,

To obtain the equivalent of 8 glasses of water in a day, you would need to drink 12 cups of coffee.

If you drink this much coffee, caffeine and other components can become a problem.

So it has been said that it's better to drink water rather than coffee or tea.

As mentioned earlier, it is not necessary to drink exactly 8 glasses of water a day.

Just because you drink coffee instead of water doesn't mean you have to drink 12 cups.

So, if we compare coffee and water, drinking water is obviously better.

However, it's not that you absolutely cannot have coffee or tea; it's just that you must drink water.

For those who don't drink much water, even drinking coffee can be beneficial for hydration.

In summary, you can drink water according to your body's response.

The body's response to hydration can be broadly categorized into two types.

The first reaction is thirst.

When your body is lacking hydration, you feel thirsty. At this time, don't force yourself to hold back; you can drink water.

Drinking water during a meal can interfere with digestion.

There is also advice that says to hold off on drinking water during meals, even if you feel thirsty, and to wait until 30 minutes later to drink.

Since food stays in the stomach for about 2 to 3 hours anyway,

There isn't a significant difference between drinking during a meal or drinking 30 minutes after.

Of course, if you drink an excessive amount of water, it can be disruptive.

Drinking about a cup of water when you're thirsty is not a problem.

The second is the color of urine.

If your body is dehydrated, the color of your urine will be a dark yellow.

If there is too much moisture in the body, the color of the urine becomes colorless and transparent.

If the color of your urine is colorless and transparent, you should reduce your fluid intake.

If the color of your urine is very dark, it means you are dehydrated, so you should drink more.

Sounds plausible, right?
