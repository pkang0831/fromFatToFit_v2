All videos have subtitles.

The theme of this video is mukbang and appetite.

There are two arguments regarding mukbang and appetite.

The first reason is that watching eating shows increases appetite.

It is claimed that it hinders dieting.

The second reason is that watching eating shows can lower your appetite due to vicarious satisfaction.

It is claimed to be helpful for dieting.

You are telling the exact opposite.

So a question came up asking which side is correct.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

First, when a person sees food, their appetite increases. This is a clear fact.

There are many experiments that observe changes in the brain by showing actual food or pictures of food.

The experiment showed that seeing food increases appetite.

If it's proven that looking at food increases appetite, isn't that the end of the discussion?

Yes, that's right.

Watching food increases appetite, so mukbangs are not good for dieting.

You can conclude this simply.

However, there are people who feel vicarious satisfaction while watching eating shows and actually experience a decrease in appetite.

It's true that we shouldn't think too simply, but there are people who can do it.

That means there is some kind of secret.

So what exactly is that secret? I am in a situation where I have questions about it.

Isn't it the difference between showing food and showing the act of eating food?

Showing food or pictures of food increases appetite.

Showing someone eating can either increase or decrease their appetite.

It's an interesting thought, isn't it? In fact, there are claims like that.

But that's not the case.

Because if that argument is correct, then "just one bite" shouldn't exist.

When a friend is eating delicious food.

It's common to see someone wanting to eat something after seeing it and asking for just one bite.

Especially in Korea, there are often instances of ramen fights occurring among family members.

Ramen is usually packaged in single servings.

If several people share one bowl of ramen, it will likely be insufficient.

So when there are family members at home, I first ask if they are thinking of eating.

If there is one more family member who is thinking of eating, then we need to boil 2 packs of ramen.

However, the family that clearly said they had no intention of eating before boiling the ramen...

Once you start cooking and eating ramen, there are often many requests for just one bite.

From the perspective of the person who cooked the ramen, it's frustrating.

I asked in advance because I was worried about this, and since you said you wouldn't eat it, I only made one.

Now that they say they will eat too.

However, if you consider the perspective of someone who asks for just a bite,

Interestingly, I really had no intention of eating at all in the beginning.

However, seeing you eat ramen makes me want some, so I ask for just one bite.

So, it's not just the food itself, but the sight of people eating food also has the effect of increasing appetite.

So what is the difference between people whose appetite increases after watching eating shows and those whose appetite does not?

The time of exposure to the stimulus varies.

When a person is repeatedly exposed to a certain stimulus, they become desensitized to that stimulus.

Even if you keep eating delicious food, you gradually stop feeling that it's tasty.

In simple terms, it's getting tired of food.

This can actually be applied without eating food.

There was an experiment that was actually conducted.

Divide the participants of the experiment into two groups.

Both groups were asked to imagine putting 30 coins into a coin laundry machine.

After making them think the same way,

Have one group imagine eating 30 M&M chocolates.

I had the other group imagine eating 3 m&m chocolates.

In reality, when I gave them a bowl filled with M&M chocolates and told them to eat as much as they wanted,

A group that imagined eating 30 M&M chocolates ended up consuming less chocolate.

So even if you haven't actually eaten it, just imagining eating it...

People who have a lot of imagination and are exposed to food stimuli frequently

This means that the desire for that food decreases.

If you watch a mukbang of someone eating the same type of food for a long time,

While being exposed to the stimulus of that food for an extended period of time

This means that the desire for that food can decrease.

In summary, when watching mukbangs, there is an initial phenomenon where appetite increases.

As time passes and the exposure to mukbang increases,

It means that appetite decreases.

So, if you watch a mukbang and can't resist eating during the initial period when your appetite increases,

After watching a mukbang, my appetite increased. This is the result that comes from it.

If you can endure the moment when your appetite increases while watching a mukbang, your appetite will decrease afterward.

This means that it has become a form of vicarious satisfaction, leading to a decrease in appetite.

In fact, many experiments have been conducted on the appetite related to mukbang.

In an experiment that showed watching mukbang increased appetite,

In the case of participants who are on a diet, there are results indicating that they experienced less increase in appetite.

For those who are dieting, they try to eat less food.

So when watching a mukbang, you unconsciously manage to suppress your initial increase in appetite.

On the other hand, a person who is not dieting does not need to resist their increasing appetite.

So, it cannot go beyond the period when appetite increases.

This phenomenon is characterized by an increase in appetite.

This is the conclusion.

When watching mukbangs, initially, it increases your appetite.

In the case of a person who has the willpower to refrain from eating during that period,

Because appetite decreases.

It is possible to feel vicarious satisfaction while watching mukbangs.

It can help with dieting.

On the other hand, those who cannot resist the initial period of increased appetite

Watching mukbangs would likely interfere with dieting.

Think about what kind of person you are, and then decide whether to watch a mukbang or not.
