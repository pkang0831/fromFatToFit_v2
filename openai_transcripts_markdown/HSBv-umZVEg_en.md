A question about the breakfast controversy has come up in the comments, so I would like to discuss it.

First, let's read the comments.

Those who argue that one should eat breakfast

Eating breakfast helps prevent overeating at lunch and dinner.

It is said to replenish the lacking energy and help with brain and physical activities.

Those who oppose eating breakfast argue that

Our bodies raise blood sugar levels in the morning to generate energy.

It is said that eating food here excessively increases insulin resistance and causes fatigue.

The importance of breakfast is that

It is said that the results were intentionally created as a result of research funded by famous processed food companies in the past.

In my opinion, as you taught me, Ronka.

If you build your diet around unprocessed foods and avoid late-night snacks,

If you're hungry, you should have breakfast, and if you're full, it seems like you don't have to.

It's a comment that says, "What do you think?"

To conclude, the writer's thoughts are correct.

If you build your diet around unprocessed foods and avoid late-night snacks,

If you are hungry in the morning, you should have breakfast, and if you are not hungry, you don't have to have breakfast.

Because the results change when the conditions change.

In any situation, under any conditions, it is always better to eat breakfast, or it is always better not to eat.

This is not how it should be.

First, let's talk about the idea that we need to have breakfast.

You need to have breakfast so that you don't binge eat at lunch and dinner.

It replenishes the lacking energy and helps with brain and physical activities.

This is true in situations where energy is needed when you wake up in the morning and start your activities.

For example,

There are times when you wake up in the morning feeling very tired.

Moving when your body is tired is quite a difficult task.

However, we have to go to work or school, so we have no choice but to move.

In a situation where it's difficult to move like this, a lot of energy is required to move.

In this situation, it's good to provide energy through breakfast.

The problem is that it's difficult to move my body, so it's hard to have breakfast.

Because I am tired and exhausted, I try to lie down a little longer rather than having breakfast.

Spending time like that leaves little time for breakfast.

It's already quite exhausting just to get ready to go out because I'm tired.

It's burdensome to prepare breakfast here and clean up afterwards.

In this situation, the body needs energy, but it is not being supplied properly.

It is common to overeat at lunch due to a compensation mentality.

When we eat food, nutrients enter our body.

The hormone that processes this nutrient is called insulin.

When excessive eating leads to a large intake of nutrients in the body,

In order to process all those nutrients, a lot of insulin hormone is also released.

The problem is that when a lot of insulin hormone is released, appetite increases and hunger arises.

It's not hunger that arises from needing food, but rather hunger that is caused by hormones.

This kind of hunger is called false hunger.

Because of this, even if I binge eat at lunch, I start wanting food again after about 3 to 4 hours.

In Korea, lunch is usually at 12 o'clock, so people tend to feel hungry for food around 3 to 4 PM.

However, since dinner can be at 6 PM, I have to endure my hunger and wait.

This is where the compensation psychology arises, and there are many cases of binge eating in the evening.

The binge eating at lunch leads to binge eating at dinner.

When you binge eat in the evening, the process of developing false hunger repeats.

About 3 to 4 hours after having dinner, I start to feel hungry again.

If you get off work at 6 and have dinner at 7, you'll be hungry around 10 to 11 at night.

One of the reasons I want to eat a late-night snack is because of this.

The food we eat takes about an average of 4 hours to digest.

Late-night snacks are consumed at a time that is too late for eating.

I often go to sleep within 1 to 2 hours after having a late-night snack.

It means staying in a state where digestion has not yet finished.

In this case, digestion should take place while sleeping.

This disrupts my sleep.

If you do not get a good night's sleep, your body cannot rest or recover properly.

So when I wake up in the morning, I feel tired and exhausted.

And the vicious cycle will repeat.

The argument for having breakfast is that eating breakfast can break this vicious cycle.

If you have breakfast in the morning, it will provide you with energy.

It will become easier to move your body.

This means that breakfast replenishes the energy that is lacking and helps with brain and physical activity.

Since the necessary energy has been supplied, there is no sense of compensation.

Because the compensation mentality does not arise, I end up not binge eating during lunch.

If you don't binge eat at lunch, insulin won't be released in large amounts.

If insulin is not produced in large amounts, false hunger won't become stronger, right?

If false hunger doesn't become stronger, you will be able to avoid binge eating in the evening.

Having breakfast prevents overeating at lunch and dinner, and this is the reason why.

And if you don't binge eat during dinner, your cravings for late-night snacks will also decrease.

If you go to bed without eating a late-night snack, you will be able to sleep soundly.

If you get a good night's sleep, you won't feel tired in the morning.

If you are not tired in the morning, moving your body becomes an easy task.

It creates a virtuous cycle.

It seems that the argument for having breakfast is correct, right?

I used to think that way.

In the past, I believed that having breakfast was essential to create this positive cycle.

So there has been a lot of talk about the importance of having breakfast if you want to diet.

However, a way to create a positive cycle without having breakfast has emerged.

It's called intermittent fasting.

Intermittent fasting is a dietary method that intentionally incorporates fasting periods.

We live in an era of abundant food.

I am eating a lot of food too often.

Because of this, the digestive system is being overworked, leading to health issues and obesity.

Having a fasting period where you intentionally do not eat food.

It's about giving the digestive system a rest, recovering health, and going on a diet.

For five days of the week, I have three meals a day, and for two days, I have one meal a day, following the 5:2 intermittent fasting method.

There is a type of intermittent fasting called 16:8, where you fast for 16 hours and eat for 8 hours within a 24-hour day.

In Korea, the 16:8 intermittent fasting method has been very popular.

In the 16:8 intermittent fasting method, the basic principle is to skip breakfast.

If you skip breakfast, you tend to binge eat at lunch and dinner. If this is true,

The 16:8 intermittent fasting, which involves skipping breakfast, requires binge eating at lunch and dinner.

However, when you listen to the stories of people who have experienced intermittent fasting, many mention that their appetite is better regulated.

At first, I worry that a 16-hour fast might be too long and that it could be difficult.

When I actually tried intermittent fasting,

At first, the 16-hour fast was difficult, but

As time goes by, my appetite gets regulated, making it easier for me.

Something seems off, right?

If you skip breakfast, you tend to binge eat at lunch and dinner.

Such reviews don't make sense.

Why is this happening?

If you draw the cycle process, you can understand why.

The 16:8 intermittent fasting means fasting for 16 hours and eating for 8 hours.

I don't eat breakfast, so I have lunch and dinner.

The meal time is from 12 PM to 8 PM, and the rest is fasting time.

Let's say you overate at lunch.

Excessive insulin is released, leading to false hunger.

This leads to binge eating in the evening.

Evening binge eating creates false hunger and makes you want to eat late-night snacks.

However, the meal time is only until 8 PM, and after that, it is fasting time when you are not allowed to eat.

Therefore, you should go to bed without eating a late-night snack.

If you go to sleep without eating a late-night snack, you will be able to sleep soundly.

Getting a good night's sleep helps you feel less tired in the morning.

If you are not tired in the morning, it becomes easier to move your body.

Since moving the body is not difficult, there is not much energy needed.

Since the energy needed is not much, there is not a strong sense of reward even if I skip breakfast.

Because the compensation mentality is not strong, it becomes possible to avoid overeating at lunch.

If you don't binge eat at lunch, you can avoid binge eating at dinner.

If you don't binge eat in the evening, your cravings for late-night snacks will decrease.

When the desire for late-night snacks decreases, it becomes easier to stick to fasting times.

At first, it's difficult to stick to the fasting schedule because of this.

It is said that when you practice intermittent fasting, your appetite gets regulated, making it easier to stick to the fasting schedule.

It creates a virtuous cycle.

When considering the positive cycle of intermittent fasting and the positive cycle of breakfast,

There are overlapping parts.

It means to not eat late-night snacks and to get a good night's sleep.

So, whether or not to binge during lunch is not determined by whether you have breakfast or not.

It depends on late-night snacks and quality sleep.

This time, I will talk about the argument that one should not eat breakfast.

Our bodies raise blood sugar levels in the morning to generate energy.

Eating food here leads to excessively high insulin resistance and causes fatigue.

Our body tries to maintain a stable blood sugar level, so when blood sugar rises, it works to lower it.

The hormone that lowers blood sugar is insulin.

When blood sugar levels rise too high, a lot of insulin is released to lower that blood sugar.

If this situation repeats, the response to insulin gradually weakens.

This is called insulin resistance because the body resists insulin.

When insulin resistance increases, more insulin is needed to perform the same tasks.

More insulin makes false hunger stronger.

If you frequently eat a lot due to false hunger, you will fall into a vicious cycle where insulin resistance becomes stronger.

So, in the morning, our body naturally raises its blood sugar levels.

In a situation where blood sugar has risen like that, if you raise blood sugar even more with breakfast,

Blood sugar levels will rise too high, and in order to lower that blood sugar, a lot of insulin will be released.

If that situation repeats, it can lead to insulin resistance and become problematic.

Therefore, the logic is that it is better not to have breakfast.

First of all, it is true that our bodies raise blood sugar levels in the morning.

However, that doesn't mean you can't have breakfast.

In the early morning, a hormone called cortisol is secreted.

Cortisol has the effect of raising blood sugar levels.

Isn't cortisol a stress hormone?

That's right.

It is called a stress hormone because it is released in stressful situations.

You need this hormone in the morning.

When we find ourselves in a stressful situation,

Our body tries to resolve the situation.

We either engage in a struggle to overcome through fighting or try to escape quickly to get away.

To struggle and escape, strong physical abilities are necessary.

Therefore, it temporarily enhances physical abilities.

It raises blood sugar to prepare energy for the brain and muscles to use.

By breathing quickly, you secure the oxygen that the brain and muscles will use.

It makes the heart beat faster to quickly deliver oxygen and energy.

This is referred to as the fight-or-flight response to stress.

You can think of it as a kind of awakening effect.

This awakening effect is necessary to wake up our bodies that are asleep.

So in the morning, cortisol hormones are released, and blood sugar levels rise.

However, this increase in blood sugar doesn't last long.

For an average person, the morning blood sugar level is below 100.

In situations where blood sugar is below 100, eating food is not a problem.

What happens if a lot of cortisol is released in the morning?

In that case, blood sugar levels can become quite high.

In that case, you should actually have breakfast.

When we eat carbohydrate foods, those carbohydrates are converted into glucose in the body.

It was said that this glucose raises blood sugar levels.

So, the glucose that increases blood sugar after a meal comes from the food.

So where does the glucose that raises blood sugar due to cortisol come from?

It must have come from somewhere in my body.

It is glucose that was stored as glycogen.

It is glucose made by breaking down proteins.

First of all, since it's urgent, it means that what is stored in the body has been drawn from here and there.

Then, naturally, there will be a reaction to try to restore it.

The desire to eat increases.

In fact, cortisol has the effect of increasing appetite.

This stress, which causes cortisol to be released, is also considered a cause of obesity.

Now let's think about it.

What situations lead to high cortisol levels in the morning?

The reason cortisol is released is to wake up our bodies while we are asleep.

In that case, if your body is tired and struggling, you might not wake up easily.

It would require a lot of cortisol to force someone to wake up.

For example, there are situations where the body feels tired due to not getting enough sleep.

Earlier, I mentioned that if you don't have breakfast in a situation like this, you tend to binge eat at lunch due to a compensation mentality.

The increase in appetite due to cortisol was included in that compensation psychology.

So, in a situation where cortisol levels are high in the morning, you should actually have breakfast.

If there is not much cortisol.

Since the increase in blood sugar due to cortisol is not significant, it doesn't matter if you have breakfast.

If we summarize the content so far in two points,

The first lunch binge is determined not by whether or not you have breakfast.

It will be determined whether you couldn't sleep well because you had a late-night snack or not.

On the second morning, cortisol hormones are released to awaken our bodies.

It is true that blood sugar levels increase due to the effects of this cortisol hormone, but

The increase in blood sugar is not very significant.

Having breakfast does not cause insulin resistance.

In the first place, everyone is different.

Body fat and muscle mass are different, and eating habits and lifestyle patterns are also different.

If you are someone who can get by with just lunch and dinner without breakfast, then it is not necessary to have breakfast.

On the contrary, there are people who find that lunch and dinner alone are not enough and need to have breakfast as well.

You must eat breakfast.  
You must not eat breakfast.

Rather than approaching it this way, it is better to do it according to your own body.

Late-night snacks interfere with deep sleep and lead to an increase in cortisol hormones in the early morning.

Overeating or consuming foods that cause a lot of insulin to be released can create false hunger.

In this situation, it is difficult to know the amount of food my body needs.

Cortisol increases appetite and creates false hunger, making you want to keep eating.

Stop late-night snacks and reduce insulin production to normalize appetite.

With that normal appetite, I check if I need breakfast.

It's better to go along with it.

I will be back with the next video. Thank you.

You said to normalize my appetite.

I understand that I should stop eating late-night snacks, but...

What should I do to prevent excessive insulin production?

You need to change the types of food you eat.

That's the most basic principle of dieting.

I used to explain the principles of dieting in detail.

I think that video will be helpful for you.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

You mentioned that intermittent fasting helps regulate appetite.

Some people have been able to control their appetite through intermittent fasting, but there are also those who haven't.

Why does the difference occur?

In the past, there were many questions about intermittent fasting, so I organized all of that and created a series of videos.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right.

If you are curious about intermittent fasting, you can click here to see more.

I've heard a lot about the saying that stress is a cause of obesity.

Just because you don't want to feel stressed doesn't mean you can avoid stress.

What should I do?

Changing your perception of stress can be very helpful.

I previously made a video on a similar question.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.
