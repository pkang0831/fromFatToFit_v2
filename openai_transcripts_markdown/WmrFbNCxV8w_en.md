What should people who gain weight even when they eat little do to diet?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

A story came in asking how someone who usually eats little should go about dieting.

I would like to tell a story.

First, let's read the content of the story.

I usually feel full after eating about half of the portion of rice served at restaurants.

I can only eat about two-thirds even if I try to eat more.

I eat side dishes in moderation, and when delicious side dishes are served, I eat less rice.

I don't even like snacks, so I don't eat them, but I still gain weight like this.

When you search for dieting tips, it often says to reduce portion sizes.

Then I have to eat 1/4, and after trying that, I feel dizzy and weak.

I don't have any particular dietary restrictions and I do home workouts on YouTube about once a week.

Sometimes when I get stressed, I tend to binge eat, but even then, I only eat about one and a half servings.

I don't think this is the reason for gaining weight, but what could the problem be?

This is the story with such content.

Let's talk in detail.

If you are eating according to the story, then you are actually someone who eats a small amount.

When such a person says "I've gained weight," they are not referring to general obesity.

Overall, I am slim, but there is some fat in various areas of my body.

For example, the whole body is slim, but there is a little belly fat in the lower abdomen.

I want to remove this or...

My thighs are not thick, but they're average, and I wish they were a bit thinner.

When I wave my arms, the fat on my forearms jiggles, and I wish this would go away.

The back or waistline is not smooth and is slightly protruding.

I hope this becomes smoother.

In this case, reducing the amount of food even further is not a very good method.

The reason those kinds of fats develop in the first place is due to insufficient food intake.

The purpose of dieting is to reduce body fat.

However, body fat is largely divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat located right next to the organs.

Subcutaneous fat is the fat located beneath the skin.

The only place in the human body where the internal organs are located is the abdomen.

So, the fat in areas like the thighs, arms, and back is all subcutaneous fat.

What about the waist and abdomen?

You need to touch that area to check it.

The human body has skin on the outside, and beneath that skin, there is subcutaneous fat.

Beneath the subcutaneous fat, there are muscles, and beneath the muscles, there are bones and internal organs.

We cannot touch the insides by feeling the boat.

Because the muscles are in the way.

Visceral fat is the fat located next to the organs, so it cannot be felt by touch.

Instead, when visceral fat increases, it pushes the muscles outward.

So when visceral fat increases, the belly swells up like a balloon.

When you touch it, you feel firm muscle instead of soft fat.

Obesity in men primarily progresses in this way.

On the other hand, the stomach does not swell like a balloon and has sagging skin on the lower abdomen.

If it feels soft when you touch it, that's subcutaneous fat.

I know what subcutaneous fat is, but...

If you reduce calories, shouldn't both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat decrease?

What does it mean that the cause of subcutaneous fat obesity is a small amount of food intake?

Visceral fat and subcutaneous fat have different functions because they are located in different areas.

Visceral fat is the fat that is located right next to the organs.

It stores excess energy or supplies the energy that is lacking.

It's a kind of energy storage.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is fat that is located far from the internal organs and is dispersed throughout the body.

So it's difficult to utilize as energy.

It primarily protects the body from external shocks or keeps it warm to prevent a drop in body temperature.

It serves the role of clothing.

The type of fat that can be reduced by decreasing meal portions is visceral fat, which serves as an energy reserve.

If you reduce your food intake, body fat may actually increase.

Let's think about it.

Even if you make a warm cup of coffee, it will eventually cool down over time.

What should I do to keep this coffee warm?

You would need to either reboil the coffee itself or boil water separately and add it to the coffee.

This means that energy needs to be supplied from the outside.

Now, let's think of this coffee as a person.

Humans are warm-blooded animals that need to maintain a constant body temperature.

If body temperature is not maintained, you will die.

So, in order to live without dying, we need a continuous supply of energy to maintain our body temperature.

The way a person obtains energy from the outside is by eating food.

What should I do if the amount of food I eat decreases?

Let's go back to the example of coffee that we talked about earlier.

I want to keep my coffee warm.

If it's difficult to frequently boil coffee or water, you can put coffee in a thermos.

Just because you put coffee in a thermos doesn't mean it will never cool down.

Because it prevents heat loss, the coffee cools down slowly.

As it cools down slowly, you don't need to boil coffee or water frequently.

By insulating and preventing heat loss, it is possible to maintain the temperature with less energy.

Earlier, I mentioned that body fat protects the body from external shocks and helps maintain body temperature.

So, if the amount of food intake decreases, it becomes difficult to secure the energy needed to maintain body temperature.

This means that more subcutaneous fat is needed to keep the body warm in order to maintain body temperature.

So, it's difficult to reduce subcutaneous fat by simply decreasing meal portions.

In fact, it is often the case that body fat increases due to a smaller amount of food intake.

How can I reduce body fat?

You need to have proper meals and exercise.

If you have a proper meal and secure enough energy needed to maintain your body temperature,

There is no need to have a lot of subcutaneous fat just for insulation.

And when you increase muscle mass through exercise and use your muscles a lot, heat is generated in the muscles.

A person's body temperature should not drop too low, but it also should not rise too high.

When heat is generated in the muscles, it must be released from the body.

However, if there is a lot of subcutaneous fat that has a heat-retaining effect, it becomes difficult for the body to release heat.

In this case, there arises a need to reduce subcutaneous fat in order to maintain body temperature.

In the story, you mentioned that you do home workouts about once a week.

One day a week is too few.

You need to increase the frequency a bit more and also raise the intensity a little.

However, if you maintain a small amount of food intake, it becomes difficult to exercise because you lack energy.

So you need to increase your food intake and also exercise.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

The first type of body fat is divided into subcutaneous fat and visceral fat.

Subcutaneous fat protects the body from external shocks and helps maintain body temperature.

The second person is a warm-blooded animal that needs to maintain a constant body temperature.

To maintain a constant body temperature, a continuous supply of energy is needed.

If you reduce the amount of your third meal, the energy supplied to your body will decrease.

It becomes difficult to secure the energy needed to maintain body temperature.

In this case, it is important to prevent the body heat you have from being lost.

To achieve that, more subcutaneous fat with insulating ability is needed.

For this reason, even if you eat less, you may feel that your body fat increases and you gain weight.

Even if you eat less, your body fat may not decrease.

To reduce body fat, you need to eat properly and exercise.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

It's fascinating that body fat increases and decreases due to temperature regulation.

So, if I exercise while wearing a sweat suit, does it have a greater effect on reducing subcutaneous fat?

No, that's not the case.

There was a question about sweat suits before, so I made a video explaining it in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top left.

If you're curious about why sweat suits do not have the effect of reducing body fat, you can click to find out.

I understand that eating too little food is not good, but...

Isn't it true that if you eat anything carelessly, you'll gain weight because of that?

What should I do about my diet?

In the past, I explained the principles of dieting and talked in detail about meal plans.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right.

I know that exercise is necessary, but...

Since I started exercising, my body has actually become bulkier.

Yes, that can happen.

Usually, when a woman says that her arms or thighs have gotten thicker from exercising,

It is often said that it is temporary or an illusion.

In reality, there are cases where it becomes thicker.

We talked about why this phenomenon occurs and what should be done about it in the video.

I will make sure it appears in the bottom left.
