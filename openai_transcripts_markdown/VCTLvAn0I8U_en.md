Binge eating refers to eating an excessive amount of food in a short period of time.

When eating a little more is referred to as overeating.

A question comparing binge eating for one day versus overeating over several days has been raised.

First, let's read the content of the question.

It's a silly question, but I'm asking out of curiosity.

You mentioned that there is a limit to the amount of food a person can absorb in a day.

Then, when there are things you want to eat piled up,

Is binge eating in one day less likely to cause weight gain than spreading it out over several days?

This is a question about such content.

To put it simply,

It is true that binge eating for one day leads to less weight gain than overeating for several days.

Basically, everything has a limit to its capacity.

Let's say there is a rice cooker for three people.

If you put in rice and water for 10 servings here, will it make 10 servings of cooked rice?

Of course, that's not the case.

It's exceeding the maximum capacity that the rice cooker can handle.

The human digestive system is the same.

There is a limit to the capacity for digestion and absorption.

If you eat a large amount of food that exceeds that limit, it won't be properly digested or absorbed.

If you drink a lot of water at once, it won't be properly absorbed.

There is a saying to drink it little by little.

And no one has become obese just because they binge ate for a day.

By maintaining eating and lifestyle habits that lead to obesity for a long time, body fat gradually accumulates, resulting in obesity.

When dieting, the hardest part is not being able to eat the foods you want.

If binge eating for a day doesn't lead to weight gain, then...

When you're on a diet and it's really tough, is it okay to binge eat once in a while?

If that's the case, it seems like it would be really helpful for dieting.

Why aren't you doing it that way?

I am already doing it.

When I'm on a diet and it's really tough, I occasionally binge eat.

If you change binge eating to a cheat day here, it becomes a familiar dieting method.

So, binge eating for one day leads to less weight gain than overeating for several days.

Binge eating for a day does not lead to obesity.

This information is not particularly new.

This is information that many people already know and have used for dieting.

Having cheat days like this seems like it could be helpful for dieting, but...

In reality, it is not like that.

Why? Why isn't it helpful?

The amount of food eaten on cheat days is gradually increasing or

It's because I often want to have cheat days.

The diet method that makes the most use of cheat days is a low-calorie diet.

To diet, intentionally limit calorie intake.

I have a cheat day once every 1 to 2 weeks where I eat as much of the food I want as I can.

In the early stages of dieting, I feel that this method is helpful.

Having a cheat day doesn't necessarily mean you'll gain weight.

Maintaining a low-calorie diet is very difficult, but

If you can hold on for just 1 to 2 weeks, there will be a cheat day.

You can just eat the food you want at that time.

Even though it's tough right now, the thought of just holding on a little longer helps me stick to my diet.

However, as time goes by, you may want to eat more food on cheat days or

I find myself wanting to have cheat days more often and for longer.

The problem is that this entire process doesn't feel real.

It is progressing without me even realizing it.

One day, you realize that something has strangely changed.

For example,

In the early stages of my diet, I would eat just one food that I wanted to indulge in on cheat days until I was full.

At some point, I started making a list of foods to eat on cheat days.

On a cheating day, I try to eat all that food or

If I'm too full to finish eating, I extend my cheat day for one more day to eat everything.

And I have plans with a friend, so there's nothing I can do.

I can't help it because I didn't buy the ingredients to make the meal plan.

There are many days when I end up having a cheat day for various reasons.

In the early stages of dieting, try to schedule plans with friends around meal times to avoid temptation.

Even when I made plans to eat, I controlled the amount I ate.

Since I prepare my meals every day, I manage the ingredients well so that they don't run out.

If I accidentally drop the ingredients, I would have gone out to buy more ingredients.

Right now, as long as there is a reasonable excuse, people are having cheat days, saying there's nothing they can do about it.

One day, when you come to your senses,

I feel that my behavior is strange.

In reality, many people go through this process and end up failing at dieting.

Is it because I followed a low-calorie diet that I ended up like that?

No, that's not the case.

In the past, humanity lived in environments where food was not abundant, and

So it has evolved into a form that can survive on very little food.

We are currently living in an environment where food is abundant, and

So I eat food too often and too much.

The digestive system is being overworked, and the body's hormonal metabolism is disrupted.

This is causing various health problems, including obesity.

Therefore, intentionally having a fasting period where you do not eat food.

Give the digestive system a break to rest and restore hormonal metabolism.

By doing that, you will become healthier and naturally lose weight.

The eating method that comes from this logic is intermittent fasting.

In Korea, the 16:8 intermittent fasting method, where one fasts for 16 hours and eats for 8 hours, is quite popular.

The purpose of this intermittent fasting is to have fasting periods, not to focus on low calories.

You don't have to eat low-calorie meals.

Rather, in the early days when intermittent fasting became known in Korea,

As the word spread that simply adhering to a 16-hour fasting period would lead to weight loss regardless of what you eat,

There were quite a few people who overate.

However, as I continued to eat more and more, overeating developed into binge eating.

Many people are finding it difficult to stick to fasting times because they often crave food.

Many people have given up on intermittent fasting because of this.

The amount of food I want to eat is gradually increasing or

Wanting to eat frequently is similar to the symptoms mentioned earlier.

Even without following a low-calorie diet, the same symptoms can occur.

The cause of such symptoms is not a low-calorie diet.

So what is the problem??

The problem is that overeating becomes a form of reward.

When we take some action

If you receive a reward through that action,

I want to repeat that behavior to receive the reward again.

To obtain a greater reward, there is a desire to strengthen that behavior.

A low-calorie diet restricts the amount of food you eat, causing your body to feel hungry.

In this situation, having a cheat day to eat the food you've been craving is a reward for your body.

Since I received a reward through a cheat day, I might want to have cheat days more often.

On cheat days, I want to eat more food to get a bigger reward.

The same goes for binge eating.

When intentionally practicing a 16-hour fast, those who find it difficult to stick to it are

The food you eat after the fasting period ends becomes a reward.

In that case, in order to gain that reward more significantly, you will start to want to eat more.

Because I want to receive rewards often.

It becomes difficult to maintain a 16-hour fast.

Binge eating or overeating is not a good behavior for dieting in the first place.

Because the situation is designed in such a way that unhealthy behaviors for the diet are rewarded.

It's natural for things that hinder your diet to lead to failure.

On the contrary, if such behavior is designed in a way that it does not lead to rewards, it will not be a problem.

In reality, I fast for 16 hours.

Anyone who finds it easy to stick to that fasting period

There is no reason to overeat during the 8-hour meal period, so it doesn't become a problem.

Rather, as time passes, appetite becomes regulated.

They say that it becomes easier to stick to a 16-hour fast.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

Comparing binge eating for one day to overeating over several days,

Binge eating for a day leads to less weight gain.

It's true that becoming obese doesn't happen from just one day of binge eating, but...

Restricting food intake and then occasionally binge eating is a method that...

It is a structure where binge eating is recognized as a reward.

In this structure, one may feel the desire to binge eat more often and in greater amounts to obtain rewards.

This is not good for dieting.

When the third human takes an action and receives a reward,

In order to obtain that reward, one tends to act more strongly or try to do it more frequently.

If you design a diet method that makes unhealthy behaviors rewarding,

In the end, failure is inevitable.

I can organize it like this.

I understand that engaging in behaviors that are not good for dieting should not be rewarded.

So how do you diet?

Gaining weight is due to eating a lot, and to lose weight, you need to eat less.

In situations where you eat less, a cheat day can only be a reward.

Yes, that's right.

I have a strong appetite and want to eat a lot, which leads me to overeat and become obese.

In this situation, a cheat day is inevitable as a reward.

On the other hand, if we say it differently,

If you satisfy your appetite for wanting to eat a lot, then a cheat day won't feel like a reward.

If cheat days are not rewarding, there will be no reason to have cheat days.

Many people think of their appetite as a trait they were born with.

In reality, it is not like that.

Appetite is influenced by hormones.

Hormones are influenced by the food I eat.

My appetite increases or decreases depending on the food I eat.

If you change the types of food you eat,

You can address the appetite that makes you want to eat so much that it leads to obesity.

I previously explained the principles of dieting and talked about this part in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I understand that eating a lot of sweets increases appetite.

To control your appetite, you ultimately need to reduce sugary foods, right?

However, I really love sweet foods.

In that case, sweet foods will always be a reward for me.

What should I do about this?

If you normalize your appetite, that part will also be resolved.

In the past, it was actually a sufficient amount of cake that I used to eat.

After restoring my body to normal, I received a story about feeling dizzy after eating, so I made a video about it.

You mentioned that having fasting periods makes eating feel like a reward, which leads to intermittent binge eating...

So does that mean I shouldn't do intermittent fasting?

Just because you practice intermittent fasting doesn't mean you will inevitably binge eat intermittently.

For those who find it difficult to stick to fasting times, meal times become a reward.

So it develops into overeating and binge eating.

People who find it difficult to stick to fasting times are not like that.

So, if you want to practice intermittent fasting, you should do it in a way that the fasting period is not too difficult.

There were many questions about intermittent fasting in the past, so I made a series of videos on the topic.

Most questions about intermittent fasting have already been answered.
