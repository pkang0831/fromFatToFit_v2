Various Vinegars! Which Vinegar is Best for Weight Loss? - Vinegar Part 3

This is the third video about vinegar.

In the first video, we talked about whether just drinking vinegar can help with weight loss.

In the second video, we talked about how to use vinegar.

In this video, I would like to talk about the types and benefits of vinegar.

Vinegar can be broadly classified into three types: synthetic vinegar, distilled vinegar, and brewed vinegar.

Synthetic vinegar is a type of vinegar made by diluting glacial acetic acid, and it has only a sour taste.

Fermented vinegar is a type of vinegar made by mixing concentrated fruit or grain extracts with acetic acid bacteria and fermenting it for 1 to 2 days.

Finally, brewing vinegar is vinegar that has been naturally fermented from grains and fruits for more than 90 days.

First of all, the acetic acid mentioned in the first video is present in all types of vinegar, regardless of the variety.

If we only talk about the weight loss effects caused by acetic acid, there is no difference between any type of vinegar.

However, it is better to consume brewed vinegar if possible.

Why should you drink brewed vinegar?

This is because drinking brewed vinegar is the most beneficial.

As mentioned earlier, any type of vinegar contains acetic acid in a similar way.

You cannot choose vinegar based on acetic acid, as they are all similar.

Then we need to choose based on other factors excluding that.

In the case of synthetic vinegar and alcohol fermentation vinegar, there are no advantages other than being inexpensive.

Since the fermentation time is long from the beginning, instead of expensive brewed vinegar.

It's a low-cost vinegar made by reducing or eliminating the fermentation time.

So the good nutrients that are abundant in brewed vinegar are not found in other types of vinegar.

And even if the price of brewed vinegar is higher than that of other vinegars,

The recommended daily amount of vinegar is less than 30ml, so once you buy it, it lasts quite a long time.

So the fact that the price is low isn't really a big advantage.

In that case, there would be no reason not to choose brewed vinegar.

What about the pineapple vinegar that was popular in the past or the drinking vinegar sold in stores?

That kind of vinegar is made to be easier to drink than the ones mentioned earlier.

Is it a product made by an individual at home or by a company?

The mechanisms are similar to this extent, so I will explain the two together.

First, pineapple vinegar is made by adding sugar and vinegar to pineapple in equal proportions.

It's vinegar that has been fermented for about two weeks.

Vinegar became extremely popular in Korea after it was mentioned on a broadcast that it has weight loss effects.

Everyone was going crazy about making vinegar at home.

To conclude, from a dieting perspective, it is not as effective as just consuming vinegar alone.

I mentioned it in the first part of the vinegar video.

The acetic acid in vinegar has the effect of slowing down the rate at which blood sugar rises after eating.

The speed at which blood sugar rises slows down, which leads to weight loss.

However, the sugars in sugar and pineapple can quickly raise blood sugar levels.

The effect of vinegar is reduced, which decreases its weight loss benefits.

So, if we compare vinegar that is made to be easy to drink with regular vinegar,

Of course, plain vinegar has a bit more of a weight loss effect.

How about using sweeteners like stevia or aspartame instead of sugar?

In the past, there was a question about Diet Coke, so I made a related video.

We talked in detail about sweeteners there.

In order for blood sugar to rise, the amount of glucose in the blood must increase.

It was said that sweeteners do not raise blood sugar levels because they do not contain glucose itself.

So using sweeteners may not cause blood sugar issues.

In fact, among the vinegar drinks available on the market, there are products that use sweeteners without sugar.

In the case of such products, the carbohydrate content is low and the calories are also low.

However, another problem may arise.

There are two main issues that arise from combining vinegar and sweeteners.

The first is that it dulls the sense of taste.

A person's taste buds can become sensitive or dull depending on the type of food they eat.

People who eat salty food become desensitized to the salty taste.

I find myself increasingly seeking out saltier foods.

On the contrary, people who eat bland food become more sensitive to taste.

Eating salty food makes it difficult to eat because it becomes too salty.

This also applies to sweetness.

People who eat a lot of sweet foods become desensitized to taste and start seeking even sweeter foods.

On the contrary, if you reduce your intake of sweet foods, your taste buds become more sensitive, making it difficult to eat sweet foods.

In fact, among the comments on my video,

Since I consistently followed the pkang diet, my taste has changed, and snacks I used to love now taste too sweet.

So there are often posts about how people have stopped eating snacks.

So, for the sake of my diet, I have to resist eating my favorite snacks for the rest of my life.

Not this concept.

The idea is to reduce the amount of sugar consumed to make the taste buds more sensitive, allowing for satisfaction with less sugar.

If that happens, it's sweet enough for me, and I am satisfied.

The actual amount of sugar consumed is small, which is why one doesn't gain weight.

However, the sweetness of sweeteners interferes with the process of this taste sensitivity becoming heightened.

So, sweeteners themselves do not raise blood sugar levels and do not cause weight gain, but...

It is better not to eat it if possible.

The second problem with sweeteners is excessive consumption.

If you want to eat vinegar because it is good for your health and beneficial for dieting,

Why not just eat vinegar? Why do we have to make it sweet to consume it?

It's because plain vinegar has a strong taste and smell, making it difficult to consume.

However, the recommended daily intake of vinegar is a small amount, less than 30ml per day.

If you make it easy to eat, it could lead to problems from overeating.

There are quite a few people who drink a lot because they like the tangy and sweet taste of vinegar.

In this case, drinking too much vinegar can cause problems in the stomach.

As mentioned in the video about distinguishing between foods that make you gain weight and foods that help you lose weight,

Food is in its most balanced state when it exists as it is in nature.

Plain vinegar has a strong taste and aroma, making it difficult to drink a lot of it.

The problem is that it is made easy to drink a lot of this.

So, does that mean we should never drink that kind of vinegar?

No, that's not the case.

As we talked about the potential problems that could arise, it seemed like it became something that should never be consumed.

The issue of overeating can be resolved by properly controlling the amount you eat.

The problem of dulling the sense of taste can be resolved by lowering the concentration.

You can add it little by little.

The issue of diminishing diet effects is not resolved, however.

Because vinegar has other benefits.

It's better to not eat it at all than to find vinegar hard to consume.

Drinking like that can be helpful.

So, to properly achieve the effects of dieting, should I just drink vinegar?

It seems like it would be really hard to eat.

And I drank pineapple vinegar, and I lost a lot of weight...

Drinking vinegar straight is obviously difficult, and you don't have to do it that way.

And there are people who have lost a lot of weight with pineapple vinegar, but...

There are people who are not like that.

The effects vary depending on the situation in which vinegar is consumed.

In the next video, I will discuss why the effects vary from person to person and how to drink vinegar.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the vinegar part 4 video.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
