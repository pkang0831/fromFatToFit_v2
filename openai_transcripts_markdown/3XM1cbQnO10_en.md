How to Develop Habits for Losing Weight - Part 3: Building a Body That Doesn't Gain Weight

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the third video about having a body type that doesn't gain weight.

In the first video, I refuted the claim that one cannot change their body type that tends to gain weight.

In the second video, it was mentioned that building muscle through exercise can prevent blood sugar spikes.

When the amount of glucose in the blood increases, blood sugar levels rise.

This is one of the causes of obesity.

Glucose in the blood can be stored as glycogen.

When you build muscle through exercise, the amount of glycogen your body can store increases.

In this way, a lot of glucose is stored as glycogen, which helps prevent blood sugar levels from rising.

In this way, even if you eat foods that make you gain weight, it prevents you from gaining weight.

This was the content of the previous video, and at the end of the video, this question was raised.

So if you have a lot of muscle, you can eat foods that make you gain weight and still...

It means that you either gain less weight or lose weight.

People with severe obesity often show a high muscle mass in their InBody test results.

Why are these people unable to lose weight?

That's an interesting question, isn't it?

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

First of all, it is true that individuals with severe obesity show high muscle mass on the InBody measurement.

Just like lifting heavy barbells helps develop muscles,

When you support heavy weight and move, your muscles develop.

Even well-developed muscles are still muscles.

The amount of glycogen that can be stored in the body will increase.

The problem is that there is a limit to the capacity.

For example, there is a warehouse that can store 100 items.

If 50 items come in a day and 20 items go out, then 30 items will remain.

If this continues, the warehouse will be full in four days, and we will no longer be able to store any more items.

So even if you have a lot of muscle mass and can store a large amount of glycogen,

There is a limit to the amount that can be stored.

If the amount of glycogen stored is high but the amount of glycogen used is low, and this situation is repeated,

The moment will come when you can no longer store glycogen.

In this case, it will not be possible to prevent weight gain by converting glucose into glycogen.

The reason the amount of glycogen stored increases is because of the consumption of processed foods.

The reason the amount of glycogen being used decreases is due to insufficient activity and exercise.

Severe obesity is caused by eating a lot of processed foods and moving very little.

It cannot prevent muscle from gaining fat, which is why it is easy to gain weight.

On the contrary, by reducing processed foods, the amount of glycogen stored is decreased.

By increasing activity levels and exercise, if you increase the amount of glycogen consumed,

It helps with dieting and makes it easy to avoid gaining weight.

Ah... I can stick to a diet if I have to, but moving or exercising is just too bothersome.

Yes, there are many people like that.

One of the reasons for feeling that annoyance is the imbalance between muscle strength and cardiovascular ability.

To use muscles, oxygen and energy are needed.

Oxygen is supplied to the body through the lungs.

Oxygen and energy are delivered to the muscles through the blood.

The heart is responsible for sending blood to the muscles.

The combined ability of the heart and lungs is referred to as cardiorespiratory capacity.

Large muscles require more oxygen and energy, and therefore need stronger cardiovascular capacity.

When you build muscle through exercise,

There is no problem because cardiovascular ability develops along with muscles during exercise.

However, in the case of severe obesity, it is not about developing muscles through exercise.

Because the muscles have developed forcefully to support heavy weight.

Compared to muscle, cardiovascular ability becomes insufficient.

My body feels heavy, and so when I move, there are many muscles I need to use.

The cardiovascular capacity that supplies oxygen and energy to those muscles is insufficient.

So, you can think of it as the car being extremely large, but the engine is very small.

When you move a car like this, it puts a very heavy load on the engine.

In reality, individuals with severe obesity may experience different outcomes even with the same amount of activity.

People who are not severely obese have a much faster heart rate and more irregular breathing.

I talked about it in the series on reasons for not wanting to exercise.

Humans respond to electrical signals.

If you stimulate the area of the brain that causes the action of raising an arm,

You can make someone raise their arm.

If you stimulate the brain to make the arm lift up, then...

Hiding the fact that stimulation was given to the brain.

If you ask someone why they raised their arm, what do you think they would say?

The experiment participants said they suddenly wanted to raise their arms.

So, it means that the signals felt in the brain are interpreted as something I wanted.

In that case, when the body moves, the load on the heart and lungs is significant.

When the signal to not move our bodies is given, how do we interpret this?

I want to not move. I don't want to move. It feels bothersome.

So it's not that people become obese because they are too lazy to move and don't engage in activities.

The order is reversed.

As the body becomes heavier due to obesity, an imbalance in muscle and cardiovascular capacity occurs.

Due to this imbalance, the brain sends out commands to reduce activity levels.

This command starts to feel bothersome.

This applies not only to obesity but also to individuals with normal weight or underweight.

All organs of the human body become stronger with use and weaken with disuse.

Using muscles leads to muscle growth, while not using them results in muscle loss.

A person with very low activity levels

Due to weight, I can maintain a certain amount of muscle mass, but my cardiovascular capacity seriously declines.

In a situation where cardiovascular capacity is low, there is a significant burden when moving.

This causes inconvenience.

When activity levels decrease due to laziness, the amount of glycogen consumed will also decrease.

In this case, even if you eat the same amount of food, you will easily gain weight.

Because of this, I used to be able to eat without any issues, but these days I feel like I gain weight no matter what I eat.

For your information, this is also a cause of age-related weight gain.

So, how should we go about solving this problem?

It's simple. You just need to move your body.

Specifically, you need to develop a habit of moving.

There are many people who play games.

Why do we play games?

It is because I receive positive rewards when I take certain actions.

Good memories of certain actions are learned repeatedly.

I want to do that action.

On the other hand, there are many people who dislike exercise.

Why would they dislike it?

It's because exercise is hard.

Because difficult memories are repeatedly learned through the act of exercising,

It is the act of not wanting to exercise.

Of course, it's natural to have to work hard to see results from exercise.

It's not that exercise is bad, but...

When creating a habit of movement, it is advised not to approach it with the concept of exercise.

You just need to connect moving your body with good memories.

If there are good walking paths or parks nearby,

It is also nice to go for a walk to enjoy the scenery.

If you are not interested in sightseeing,

You can walk while listening to the music you like.

If there is a pretty café a bit far away, you can have a cup of coffee there.

If you don't want to go outside, you can stretch inside the house.

The most important thing is that if you find it difficult or don't want to continue, you can stop immediately.

You don't have to force yourself to do something you don't want to.

I just feel good going outside. If that's the case, then walk around a bit more.

If you feel like it's getting tough, you can just go back home.

The goal is to continue reinforcing good memories.

When I move like this, if I repeatedly learn in situations that make me feel good,

Later, I will intentionally set aside time to go for a walk in the park.

I created a music playlist to listen to while walking.

I go out on purpose because I want to walk while listening to music.

You develop a habit of moving.

This habit helps prevent feelings of annoyance.

You should not feel lazy; move your body to use up glycogen.

This way, you can maintain a state where you don't gain weight.

People who tend not to gain weight often have these habits.

And because this habit reduces the resistance to exercise,

It is very helpful for dieting.

It's not that difficult, so go ahead and try it starting today.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about fat cells.

The number of fat cells is determined in childhood and does not change after becoming an adult.

A person who was obese in childhood has an increased number of fat cells.

After becoming an adult, it is not possible to reduce the number of fat cells and become a body that does not gain weight.

The content of the video was that this claim was incorrect.

There is information suggesting that it is possible to reduce the number of fat cells.

I received a comment asking for ways to reduce fat cells.

So in the next video, I will talk about fat cells.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 4 of the body type that doesn't gain weight,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

If you found this video helpful, please subscribe and like it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
