Exercise after a meal vs. eating after exercise: which is better? - Part 3 of exercising after a meal.

This is the third video about exercising after meals.

In the first video, I talked about an experiment where walking for 30 minutes after meals resulted in a weight loss of 3 kg in a month.

In the second video, we talked about how to walk after a meal.

In this video, it's not about light activities like walking after a meal.

I would like to talk about engaging in intense exercises such as weightlifting and running.

The basic exercise knowledge we generally know is that exercising after a meal is not good.

So it's said that exercising before a meal is good.

I heard about an experiment that says walking for 30 minutes after a meal can help you lose 3 kg in a month.

It is natural to wonder whether exercising after a meal is better for dieting than exercising before a meal.

First of all, in the first video, it was mentioned that weight training after a meal is not very good.

Intense exercise interferes with digestion, so digestion is not functioning properly.

I feel bloated and have a bitter taste coming up because I can't digest properly, so I can't exercise.

It's not good for digestion or exercise.

The reason you are advised not to eat before exercising is because of this.

But if digestion is not good, isn't it good for dieting? This question arises.

Foods that are said to be good for dieting are basically those that are not easily digested or absorbed.

Rather than white rice, which has no skin and is easy to digest and absorb,

Brown rice, which has a husk that makes digestion and absorption difficult, is a better food for dieting.

Rather than high-calorie foods that provide a lot of energy when digested,

Foods that are low in calories and provide little energy even when digested are good for dieting.

In fact, when comparing pre-meal exercise and post-meal exercise

There have been experiments showing that exercising after a meal is more effective for reducing body fat.

After exercising after a meal, it interfered with digestion, and the amount of food absorbed by the body decreased.

As the amount of food absorbed by the body decreases, it leads to an increased use of body fat.

So, is doing weight training after a meal good for dieting?

No, that's not the case.

Many people believe that the amount of calories burned through exercise directly correlates with a reduction in body fat.

So, I think that in order to diet, one should do exercises that burn a lot of calories.

That's not actually the case.

If we eat less food, the energy that enters our body becomes insufficient.

Our bodies respond by lowering the energy we consume to adapt to this.

The story is that if you eat less or starve yourself to lose weight, your basal metabolic rate decreases.

Similarly, if we increase the energy we consume through exercise,

Our bodies respond by trying to increase the energy that enters them.

Your appetite increases, making you want to eat more food or

The absorption rate has increased, allowing for more energy to be absorbed from the same food.

To secure the energy needed for exercise, one may lower other metabolic rates.

I talked in detail about the reasons why you don't lose weight even with high-calorie-burning exercises in the video.

So, if you exercise after eating, it temporarily hinders digestion and can lead to a further reduction in body fat.

This is a temporary phenomenon, similar to losing weight when you starve yourself.

As time passes and the body starts to react, the effects will diminish.

So when comparing pre-meal and post-meal exercise over a long period of time,

There are experiments that show no difference in body fat reduction.

What kind of experiment has results that keep changing?

So is exercising before a meal good? Or is exercising after a meal good?

It's because the conditions of the experiment have changed.

It was effective in the short term, but over the long term, the effect has diminished.

Rather than saying one exercise is better than another,

It is correct to say that it varies depending on the purpose of the exercise.

Exercise has various purposes depending on the type.

In the case of weight training, the main goal is to increase muscle mass.

When muscle mass increases through weight training, there is an effect of reducing subcutaneous fat.

When the basal metabolic rate and activity metabolic rate increase, visceral fat can decrease.

The reason why increasing muscle mass through weight training leads to weight loss is because of this.

However, for muscles to grow, three things are necessary: load, nutrition, and rest.

By applying a strong load to the muscles through exercise, it creates the perception that the muscles need to grow more.

Eat foods rich in nutrients necessary for building muscle.

Muscles grow when you rest well.

In the case of weight training after a meal, it can temporarily hinder digestion, which may lead to weight loss.

It hinders digestion, making it difficult to obtain the nutrients necessary for muscle growth.

Therefore, muscle growth is hindered.

So, there is a weight loss effect, but it is temporary.

You lose the weight loss benefits that come from increased muscle mass.

As a result, there is no effect on dieting.

Therefore, if the goal is muscle growth, it is better to do weight training before meals rather than after.

In summary, it means understanding the purpose of exercise and utilizing it accordingly.

To use post-meal exercise for dieting, the goal is to suppress the rise in blood sugar levels.

By suppressing the rise in blood sugar from eating with light exercise, you can achieve weight loss.

The goal is to suppress the rise in blood sugar, not to build muscle.

Exercise after a meal doesn't need to be long or intense.

Walking for about 10 to 30 minutes is sufficient.

In the first place, it should suppress the rise in blood sugar without interfering with digestion.

Short and light exercises are what post-meal workouts are about.

So, how can I exercise longer and more intensely after eating?

There is no need to worry about this.

On the contrary, exercises aimed at muscle growth, like weight training, should be done for a long duration and with intensity.

This can interfere with digestion, so it is not suitable to exercise after eating.

If you are going to do weight training, it is better to do it as a pre-meal workout according to your goals.

And I am doing one hour of fasted exercise for my diet.

There is also a question about whether walking after a meal is better than exercising on an empty stomach for an hour.

Fasting exercise refers to working out on an empty stomach, while post-meal walking is considered post-meal exercise, so their purposes are different.

It's difficult to say what is better or worse because the purposes are fundamentally different.

And in the first place, there is no need to choose one out of the two options.

After walking post-meal, it was so exhausting that I can't do exercise on an empty stomach either.

After walking post-meal, it doesn't mean that I won't have time for fasting exercise.

Just continue doing the exercises you were originally doing.

Do you sit and rest during the break after a meal?

You can either get up, walk a bit, and lose weight, or you can decide otherwise.
