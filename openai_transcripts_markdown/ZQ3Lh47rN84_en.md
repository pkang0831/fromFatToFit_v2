The topic of this video is a low-sodium diet and the relationship between sodium and body fat increase.

A question with the following content was posted in the comments.

When dieting, the importance of carbohydrates and fats is often emphasized.

So, does sodium not affect the increase of body fat?

Is it just a role of absorbing moisture to create swelling?

There is a perception that sodium is not good when dieting.

I am curious about the reason for that.

Thank you for leaving such a question; I will discuss it.

Sodium is an essential nutrient that is necessary for our body, and it is maintained at a constant concentration.

If I consume a lot of sodium, the amount of sodium in my body will increase.

To maintain concentration, the amount of water in the body increases.

So in the past, if you ate food that was salty, the sodium levels would increase.

To adjust the concentration, you need to increase the amount of body water.

It has been a common perception that drinking a lot of water is beneficial.

However, it is said that this is not actually the case.

For a space exploration travel simulation.

An experiment was conducted on Russian astronauts to observe physical changes when their salt intake was increased.

Most people expected that they would drink a lot of water, but...

Most participants in the experiment reported an increase in their salt intake.

It is said that the thirst has decreased and the feeling of hunger has increased.

Let's think about it.

When the amount of sodium in the body increases, it is natural for body water to increase in order to balance the concentration.

However, it means that the increasing moisture is not being supplied from the outside.

So, when we looked into how to create moisture,

It is said that body fat was burned to create water.

Many people are unaware that water is produced when fat is burned.

Fat is an organic compound formed by the combination of fatty acids and glycerol.

Both fatty acids and glycerol contain carbon.

When carbon combines with oxygen, it forms carbon dioxide and water.

The process in which carbon dioxide is produced by combining with oxygen is similar to combustion, where fire burns.

We express it as burning fat or fat combustion.

And there is one interesting story.

Since this chemical formula became known...

Oxygen is needed to burn fat.

Therefore, aerobic exercise burns body fat, while anaerobic exercise does not burn fat.

So there has been a lot of talk that if you want to lose weight, you shouldn't do anaerobic exercise, but rather focus on aerobic exercise.

It makes sense theoretically.

However, it's impossible to exercise without breathing.

The exercise referred to as anaerobic exercise is performed without breathing for about 10 seconds.

After that, it changes to aerobic exercise because you start to breathe.

Any exercise involves a mix of aerobic and anaerobic components.

This distinction is essentially meaningless.

Recently, exercise intensity is classified into high-intensity and low-intensity workouts based on heart rate.

Anyway

For those who find this content complicated, just think of a camel.

Camels can cross the desert without drinking much water.

The reason this is possible is that camels and other animals store large amounts of fat in their humps.

This is because fat can be broken down to obtain moisture.

However, after seeing this, there may be some interesting thoughts coming to mind for some of you.

Wait a moment.

When the sodium levels in the body increase, it burns fat to increase body fluids.

In that case, the more salty food you eat, the more hydration you need, and it means that a lot of fat is being burned.

Is it true that eating salty food is better for dieting? There may be people who think this way.

It's a very interesting thought.

To get straight to the point, consuming a lot of sodium is not beneficial for dieting.

Because it was explained at the beginning of the video.

Eating a lot of sodium can lead to a decrease in thirst and an increase in appetite.

Since body fat is burned to obtain moisture, thirst will decrease.

Since the burned body fat needs to be replenished, a feeling of hunger arises.

In the end, it’s a situation where everything comes back to where it started.

I consumed a lot of sodium, so my body fat was burned.

Appetite has increased to supplement body fat.

Increased appetite leads to eating food, and body fat is restored.

You will go through this process.

Because everything eventually comes back to where it started, eating a lot of sodium is not necessarily good for dieting.

There is someone who thinks differently after hearing this content.

Isn't it enough to eat a lot of sodium, burn a lot of body fat, and just endure the hunger that follows?

There are people who think like this.

I talked about whether it's possible to eat whatever I want and still diet in this video.

The appetite that arises from the body's metabolic processes is so strong that it cannot be resisted by a person's will.

Most people cannot resist and eat food.

If we could just endure it, there would be no reason for us to fail at dieting.

If you want to eat something, you can just hold back.

Then anyone would succeed in dieting.

However, even though I know I should endure and try to endure, I end up failing at my diet because I can't hold back.

To successfully diet, it is important to eliminate unnecessary cravings.

It's not that I want to eat but I'm holding back.

You need to think about why you want to eat.

Therefore, it is correct to reduce sodium intake (if you are consuming more than necessary).

If you are curious about the content of this video, you can click the video link in the top right corner to watch it.

This time, let's think in the opposite way.

If you reduce your sodium intake, which you have been consuming in excess,

The increase in appetite caused by the rise in sodium will disappear.

So it becomes a bit easier to stick to the diet.

When the amount of sodium in the body decreases, the amount of water in the body also decreases.

The weight will decrease by the amount of water lost, and the body size will also decrease.

"I reduced the sodium I was consuming a lot, and now my appetite, weight, and body size are all decreasing~"

So the perception that reducing sodium is good for dieting has emerged.

Then does it directly affect body fat reduction? Not really.

Because the reduced appetite is caused by initially consuming a lot of sodium.

It just increased from its original position and then returned.

The reduced moisture is not body fat.

Consuming too much sodium is indeed bad for dieting.

The amount of body water increases, leading to an increase in weight and body size.

This is because there is an increase in unnecessary appetite.

So if you're eating a lot, it's right to reduce it.

Eating less is not necessarily better for dieting.

Sounds plausible, right?

In the second part of the video, I will explain the reasons why a low-sodium diet can be harmful.
