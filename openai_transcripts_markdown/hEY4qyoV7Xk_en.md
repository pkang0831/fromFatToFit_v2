It's said that effective dieting methods vary from person to person.

However, a question was raised in the comments asking why effective diet methods differ from person to person.

First, let's read the content of the question.

The principle of losing weight must be one.

Why do different people have different effective diet methods?

They say that it's because everyone's constitution is different.

Like a body type that easily gains weight or a body type that easily loses weight.

I understand that there is a body type involved in gaining and losing weight, but...

Body type suitable for a low-carbohydrate diet  
Body type suitable for intermittent fasting

It's strange that there are different body types depending on the dieting methods.

Why is this happening?

It's a question like this. It's an interesting question, isn't it?

The fundamentals of dieting are diet and exercise.

The problem is that many people struggle with dieting.

It means that you are trying to do only some parts of the diet and exercise that you think are necessary.

It's not about choosing one between diet and exercise.

One important aspect of a diet is that you only choose some parts of it.

For example, a diet plan is

What do you eat?  
Types of food you eat.

When do we eat? The time for eating food.

How much do you eat? The amount of food you consume.

All three of these are important.

However, during meal times, I eat low-calorie foods like vegetable salad.

There are quite a few people who eat snacks when it's not mealtime.

Eating food when it's not mealtime and eating snacks.

These two things are obviously not good for dieting.

However, even so,

They believe that if they just control the amount of food they eat, meaning the calories, they can lose weight.

That is the kind of behavior they exhibit.

It's about focusing only on calories, ignoring the types of food and the timing of eating.

This method doesn't work well for dieting.

Every time you eat snacks, insulin hormones are released.

One of the functions of the insulin hormone is to store body fat.

Just like we cannot go left while going right at the same time.

While the insulin hormone, which is responsible for storing body fat, is being released,

Because the glucagon hormone that burns body fat cannot be released.

The burning of body fat is not going well.

I have been diligently controlling the amount of food I eat, but...

Someone who hasn't seen much effect from dieting.

I think that controlling the amount of food I eat doesn't suit me.

I will look for other diet methods.

At this time, I have experienced that intermittent fasting works well for dieting.

Intermittent fasting is a dietary method where you eat for 8 hours a day and fast for 16 hours.

It's a diet method that focuses on the time spent eating.

The reason why the diet wasn't going well in the first place is...

It was because I only focused on calories, ignoring the types of food and the timing of eating.

In this situation, adjusting the time for eating through intermittent fasting has been added.

That's why the effects of the diet become greater.

If you also change the types of food you eat here, the diet effect will be even greater, right?

Then, conversely, with intermittent fasting, focus only on the time when you eat.

If you ignore the types and amounts of food you eat, will you not be able to lose weight?

Yes, that's right.

Actually, among those who practice intermittent fasting, some become too obsessed with the 16-hour fasting period.

If you just do a 16-hour fast

During the 8-hour eating window, you can eat anything and still lose weight.

There are people who make such claims.

Even if you stick to a 16-hour fasting period, if you binge eat for 8 hours, you won't lose weight.

Let's talk about exercise this time.

The front part of the thigh is too developed and protrudes too much.

When there is a person with thick calves who has lower body obesity.

If this person is exercising for the purpose of dieting,

Since the focus is on dieting, you should do lower body exercises.

Otherwise, I plan to do exercises like walking or running.

However, even with diligent exercise, there are often cases where lower body obesity does not get resolved.

One of the causes of lower body obesity is posture.

We often lean our heads forward to look at computers or smartphones.

However, the head is quite heavy.

When you tilt your head forward, the lower part moves in the opposite direction to maintain balance.

When the head tilts forward, the back and chest lean back.

When the back and chest lean back, the lower abdomen protrudes forward.

When the lower abdomen protrudes forward, the hips move back.

When the hips move back, it puts strain on the muscles in the front of the thighs.

If the muscles in the front of the thigh are continuously under load,

That part of the muscle sticks out prominently.

And when the lower abdomen protrudes, the abdominal muscles relax.

If this condition continues, the abdominal muscles will gradually become smaller.

When the buttocks stick out and the glutes lose tension, the glutes gradually become smaller.

The abdominal muscles and gluteal muscles are the core muscles in our body.

When this muscle weakens, it becomes difficult to maintain balance in the body.

When it becomes difficult to maintain balance, my body keeps leaning every time I walk.

In the process of supporting a tilting body and regaining balance,

There is a strong load on the calf muscles.

In this case, the calves will gradually become thicker.

To solve this lower body obesity, you need to correct your posture.

To correct your posture, you need to do upper body exercises along with lower body exercises.

If you only do lower body exercises without any upper body workouts,

Since the posture is not corrected, the problem remains unresolved.

If you exercise, such as walking or running, with weak abdominal and glute muscles,

During the process of walking and running, my balance keeps breaking down, and my calves are being overworked.

This can cause your calves to become thicker.

I wanted to slim down my calves, so I exercised.

If my calves actually become thicker, I would think that exercise is not suitable for me.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

The first principle of dieting is a combination of diet and exercise.

A diet refers to everything about what, when, and how much one eats.

Exercise refers to full-body workouts.

A significant number of people who are on their second diet

I am planning to choose only some parts of the diet and exercise.

Because of this, there are cases where people diet and exercise but still do not lose weight.

When I find a diet method that fills in the gaps in my diet or exercise that I lack,

Because the shortcomings have been addressed, there is an effect of weight loss.

Everyone has different shortcomings, and the diet methods that can address those shortcomings are also different.

There is a growing awareness that effective dieting methods vary from person to person.

It can be organized like this.

So, in order to diet, you need all three: A, B, and C.

A-only individuals can follow a diet method that allows them to obtain B and C.

Think that it suits you.

A and C can be obtained through a diet method for those who only have B.

It means thinking that it is right for oneself.

However, the principle of dieting is the same, and the things you need to do are also the same.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

I think it would be good to do full-body exercises without distinguishing between aerobic and anaerobic workouts.

I'm not sure how to plan my diet.

How should I plan my diet considering the types, amounts, and timing of the foods I eat?

I explained in detail how to create a diet plan in another video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have a video about the diet appear in the top left.

I know that exercise is important for dieting, but...

It's really difficult to exercise because everyday life is already so tiring and hard.

What should someone like me do?

You need to gradually increase your physical fitness to reduce fatigue in your daily life.

I previously made a detailed explanation video because the same question came up.

I will make sure to display related videos in the upper right corner.

Are there any videos about alcohol, aside from diet and exercise?

There is a saying that drinking alcohol can lead to weight gain.

Alcohol does have calories, but since those calories are not stored as body fat,

Alcohol itself doesn't cause weight gain, but the snacks eaten with alcohol do.

There is a saying that you can drink alcohol as long as you don't eat any snacks.

I'm not sure what is right.

I previously discussed alcohol and dieting in detail in a series.

I will make sure to have videos about alcohol and dieting appear in the bottom left.
