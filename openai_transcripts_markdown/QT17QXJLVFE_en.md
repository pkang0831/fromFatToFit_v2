Someone who tried intermittent fasting to lose weight but ended up gaining weight instead.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I received a story about someone who started intermittent fasting and actually gained weight, so I want to discuss it.

First, let's read the content of the story.

Mr. pkang, I am a person whose only healing is eating snacks while watching Netflix after work.

I want to go on a diet, but...

To diet, I think I need to stop snacking while watching Netflix.

I tend to experience a lot of stress at work.

If I give up my only healing, I don't think I can endure it at all.

So I had given up on dieting.

I watched a video about intermittent fasting on YouTube.

It's not that I didn't know about intermittent fasting.

I knew that fasting for 16 hours a day while skipping breakfast and only eating lunch and dinner was a thing.

However, the person who appeared in the video I watched is...

Set the meal time from 3 PM to 11 PM.

They said they spend the remaining time fasting.

In this case, I heard that you can still do intermittent fasting even if you have dinner plans with friends or a company gathering.

I thought I could do it that way too, so I started right away the next day.

I originally didn't have an appetite in the morning, so I didn't have breakfast.

Not having lunch wasn't that difficult.

As the afternoon approached, I started to feel a bit of a drop in my energy.

I ate a little snack at 3 PM when the fasting time ended.

While working in the office, I found that the only thing I could eat was snacks.

I was really happy at first because I lost weight even after doing this.

However, as time passed, I gradually started to gain weight again.

Recently, I've actually gained more weight than before I started intermittent fasting.

And my body has become strange.

I originally didn't have an appetite in the morning, but these days I want to eat something right from the morning.

The snacks to eat at 3 PM are in the desk, and when I go to the office, I keep wanting to eat the snacks.

When lunchtime comes, it's hard not to eat lunch because I'm so hungry.

I have to stick to the fasting hours, so I'm holding on.

Maybe that's why I've become more irritable, and I eat a lot of snacks as soon as it hits 3 o'clock.

It's really tough from the time I go to work until I get off, and I've gained a lot of weight.

I want to go back to before I started intermittent fasting.

I'm afraid that if I stop intermittent fasting now, I'll gain more weight.

If I had known it would turn out like this, I wouldn't have done intermittent fasting.

What should I do?

This is the story of such content. Let's discuss it in detail.

To summarize the content of the story,

Before starting intermittent fasting, I used to have two meals a day: lunch and dinner.

I used to live a life where I watched Netflix while eating simple snacks.

So, I had two meals and one snack.

Since starting intermittent fasting, I have stopped eating lunch.

I ended up having snacks that I can eat while working at 3 PM.

If there were no changes in the amount of the remaining meals.

I had meal number 1 and snack number 2.

Compared to when I had two meals and one snack, the amount of food I eat has decreased.

Since the amount of food I eat has decreased, it's only natural that I would lose weight.

However, this state will not be maintained indefinitely.

Our body fundamentally tries to maintain a stable and constant state.

This is called homeostasis.

This homeostasis tries to balance the energy coming into and going out of the body.

If you eat less food, the energy you get from food will decrease.

To increase appetite and encourage eating more food, or

I am trying to reduce the energy my body consumes as much as the energy I get from food has decreased.

In order to actually diet, if you follow a low-calorie diet by eating less food,

At first, you lose weight, but...

As time goes by, the desire for food increases, making it difficult to stick to a diet.

Many people tend to have cheat days, lose control and binge eat, or give up on their diets.

Of course, not everyone is like that, and there are people who endure with strong willpower.

This will reduce the energy that the body consumes.

When the energy consumed by the body decreases, even if you eat less food, you will no longer lose weight.

When you eat the same amount of food, you can more easily gain weight.

If you lose weight by starving yourself because of this, your basal metabolic rate will decrease, making it easier for you to gain weight.

You shouldn't lose weight by starving yourself.

There are many stories like this.

Let's return to the original story.

The person sharing their story has reduced the amount of food they eat while practicing intermittent fasting.

So I lost weight.

The energy balance has been disrupted.

You need to either increase your appetite or reduce the energy your body consumes.

Lowering the basal metabolic rate can be quite a burden on the body.

Most of the basal metabolic rate is the energy consumed by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

We need to reduce the function of such organs.

It takes a long time and is not good for your health either.

So, before the basal metabolic rate decreases, the desire for food increases first.

The time when the 16-hour fast ends, which is at 3 PM, is the time I feel the hungriest.

When the desire for food increases, the amount of food consumed at that time tends to increase.

The food that the person in the story eats at this time is snacks.

Eating a lot of processed foods like snacks causes a significant release of insulin.

A lot of insulin creates false hunger, leading to increased food intake.

This will lead to an increase in the amount of dinner eaten after work and snacks consumed while watching Netflix.

The person finishes work at 6 PM, has dinner, and

After that, I'm watching Netflix while eating snacks.

I will have a snack after the food I ate for dinner has been digested to some extent.

Considering that the person's intermittent fasting allows for meals until 11 PM,

There is a high possibility of eating snacks around 10 PM.

Eating food at such a late hour will naturally cause problems.

It takes about an average of 4 hours for the food we eat to be digested.

The food eaten at 10 PM takes until 2 AM to digest.

The person will probably go to sleep before 2 AM since they have to go to work the next day.

In this case, digestion occurs while sleeping.

This increases appetite in the morning.

In the past, I actually had no appetite in the morning, and skipping lunch wasn't difficult for me.

Right now, I've been hungry since the morning, and it's become difficult to skip lunch.

I've been snacking while watching Netflix for a long time.

If that causes an increase in appetite,

Shouldn't I have had a high appetite in the morning even before starting intermittent fasting?

Before starting intermittent fasting,

I was worried about gaining weight, so I ate as little as possible, and it didn't really become a problem.

Eating late at night is not a good habit in itself, but...

If you eat as little as possible, it does reduce the problems to some extent.

However, I started eating a lot of snacks.

That snack made me feel a false sense of hunger, and I started wanting to eat a lot of food.

Since I'm doing a 16-hour fast, it should be okay to eat more.

Since I skipped lunch, it should be okay to eat more.

It is highly likely that you ended up eating more while justifying it to yourself like this.

This will lead to an increased appetite from the morning.

If you keep holding on until 3 PM,

As a result, the amount of snacks eaten at 3 PM can increase.

If you eat more snacks, the false hunger becomes stronger.

The intensified false hunger makes you eat more for dinner and late-night snacks.

It is falling into a vicious cycle.

This vicious cycle is why I gain more weight than before I started intermittent fasting.

So, if we remove the part about intermittent fasting from the story...

Instead of having lunch, I ate snacks and had more late-night snacks.

Doing this will obviously lead to weight gain.

To diet, I need to eat rice instead of snacks and reduce late-night meals.

Because I acted in completely the opposite way.

It's something very obvious, and the person sharing the story is not unaware of this.

However, it was overshadowed by intermittent fasting, so I couldn't see it properly.

You can stop intermittent fasting, have a meal instead of snacks for lunch, and cut out late-night snacks.

Doing that will help you lose weight.

Does that mean intermittent fasting is not recommended?

It's not that you shouldn't do intermittent fasting, but rather that you shouldn't do it in a strange or distorted way.

Intermittent fasting does not include recommendations to eat snacks or late-night meals.

We are living in an era where food is abundant, so we eat too often and too much.

Because of this, the digestive system is being overworked, leading to various health problems, including obesity.

Having a fasting period during which you do not eat food.

Let's allow the digestive system to rest and address various health issues, including obesity.

This is the essence of intermittent fasting.

This is why I am doing a 16-hour fast.

Eating a late-night snack and going to sleep without fully digesting it is

It puts a burden on the digestive system and is not good for health.

Eating snacks instead of a nutrient-rich meal is the same thing.

So in intermittent fasting, it is recommended to eat lunch and dinner instead of having a late-night snack.

It is said that the 8 hours of eating time is just as important as the 16 hours of fasting.

If you have a proper, high-quality meal for 8 hours, then you can fast for 16 hours without any issues.

Ignoring all these aspects, just because there is intermittent fasting for 16 hours...

That is not intermittent fasting.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

Our bodies have homeostasis, which is the tendency to maintain a stable and constant state.

I am trying to balance the energy supplied to the body and the energy consumed by the body.

Second

If you eat less food, the energy supplied to your body will decrease.

To maintain the balance of energy, the desire to eat becomes stronger.

At this time, eating snacks or late-night meals can create false hunger, which increases appetite even more.

This could actually lead to weight gain.

Third

To diet, it's not about eating less food, but rather...

We need to change the types of food we eat to eliminate false hunger and reduce late-night snacks.

I can organize it like this.

I will be back with the next video.

Thank you.

You mentioned that if you eat less, due to homeostasis, your appetite increases or your basal metabolic rate decreases.

So, how exactly should one go about dieting?

And why does homeostasis only interfere with dieting?

When you eat less, if your appetite increases and your basal metabolic rate decreases,

On the contrary, when you eat a lot, shouldn't your appetite decrease or your basal metabolic rate increase?

Yes, that's right.

When you eat a lot, there are mechanisms that can lead to a decrease in appetite or an increase in basal metabolic rate.

Using such mechanisms can be quite helpful for dieting.

The same question came up before, so I explained it in detail in a video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

The person sharing their story said that watching Netflix while eating snacks is their only form of healing.

How should I stop eating that snack?

There are four main reasons for the desire for snacks.

Since there are three issues related to food, dietary adjustments need to be made.

The other one is something I eat out of habit, and this requires correction of the habit.

Make sure to have a video about diet control appear in the top right corner.

I will set it up so that a video about habit correction appears in the bottom left.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
