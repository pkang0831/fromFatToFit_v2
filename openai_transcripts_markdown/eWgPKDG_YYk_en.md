How to Eat a Lot of Fatty Foods Without Gaining Weight - Part 2: A Body That Doesn't Gain Weight

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the second video about having a body type that doesn't gain weight.

In the first part of the video, we discussed the reasons why the claim that one cannot change their body type to avoid gaining weight is incorrect.

In this video, I would like to talk about exercise and muscles.

In dieting, it's often said that diet is much more important than exercise.

However, if you only diet through your meal plan, it's easy to experience a rebound effect.

They say that you must exercise.

Diet is much more important, so why should we exercise?

They say that if you exercise and build muscle, your basal metabolic rate increases, which helps prevent weight gain.

Yes, there is such a story.

However, most of the basal metabolic rate is

It is the energy consumed by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

19% of the basal metabolic rate is consumed by the brain.

7% from the heart, 27% from the liver.

10% is consumed by the kidneys and 19% by the other organs.

The remaining 18% is the energy consumed by the muscles.

It's not even one-fifth of the basal metabolic rate.

Since this combines all the muscles in the body, the actual metabolic rate consumed by the muscles is lower.

Typically, the metabolic rate for 1 kg of muscle is about 13 kcal.

So even if I work out hard and gain 10kg of muscle,

The increasing basal metabolic rate is about 130 kcal.

How much is this approximately?

A slice of bread has 130 kcal.

Can an increase in this amount of calorie intake lead to a body type that doesn't gain weight?

It would be difficult for that to happen.

Isn't it just a matter of increasing muscle more?

That's almost impossible.

The 10kg being mentioned here does not refer to body weight.

It refers to purely increasing muscle mass by 10 kg.

Even if someone is often referred to as a "tiny person" or "shrimp,"

If you purely increase your muscle mass by 10kg, you will have a muscular body sufficient to compete in a competition.

Gaining just 10 kg of muscle is an unrealistic and difficult task.

Moreover, as muscle mass increases, muscle growth becomes more difficult.

Even if you increase it by up to 10kg, increasing it beyond that is much more difficult.

Even if we assume that it has increased by up to 20kg,

The increase in basal metabolic rate is equivalent to the calories in two slices of bread.

So, does building muscle not have any effect on preventing yo-yo dieting?

However, people who exercise say that they don't gain weight even if they eat a lot.

Some people say that their body type has changed after building muscle through exercise.

What are those kinds of people?

It's because of blood sugar.

Recently, an important aspect of dieting is the change in blood sugar levels.

If blood sugar levels frequently and significantly rise,

To lower this blood sugar, insulin is secreted frequently and in large amounts.

This is the cause of obesity.

On the contrary, preventing blood sugar from frequently and significantly rising leads to weight loss.

Eating processed foods frequently can cause blood sugar levels to rise quickly and significantly.

We need to reduce the intake of processed foods.

By approaching it with this concept, changing the food you eat can lead to a diet plan.

I eat too much food too often, so my blood sugar frequently rises a lot.

You need to have a fasting period during which you do not eat food.

Approaching it with this concept leads to intermittent fasting.

When you eat food, the number of glucose in the blood increases, which is referred to as high blood sugar.

To the extent that digestion and absorption are not hindered after eating.

If you move your body and use up glucose as energy,

The number of glucose in the blood decreases, thus preventing an increase in blood sugar levels.

Then you will lose weight.

Approaching it this way, it becomes post-meal exercise.

A diet plan that reduces the intake of processed foods is

Any diet can be effective for weight loss.

Intermittent fasting also has weight loss benefits.

Exercising after meals means walking for 30 minutes every day after eating.

There is also an experiment that shows a weight loss of 3 kg per month.

Building muscle through exercise is a similar concept to becoming a body type that doesn't gain weight.

The glucose in the blood that raises blood sugar levels is

It can be converted into fat and stored as body fat.

It can be converted into glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles.

If you exercise to increase muscle mass,

The total amount of glycogen that can be stored in the body increases.

So even if we eat the same foods that cause weight gain and our blood sugar levels rise similarly,

People with low muscle mass and the ability to store only a small amount of glycogen are

Only a small amount of glucose is stored as glycogen.

A lot of glucose that is not stored as glycogen raises blood sugar levels significantly, leading to weight gain.

On the other hand, a person with a lot of muscle mass can store a significant amount of glycogen.

Since a lot of glucose is stored as glycogen, blood sugar does not rise significantly.

Then you won't gain weight, right?

In fact, South Korean swimmer Park Tae-hwan is

I mentioned in the documentary that I lost over 7 kg just by sleeping.

Looking at this, on the internet...

I interpreted it as, "Since I have a lot of muscle mass and a high basal metabolic rate, I can lose weight just by sleeping."

As I mentioned at the beginning of the video,

Even with a lot of muscle mass, the increase in basal metabolic rate is not that significant.

In the first place, swimmer Park Tae-hwan's body does not have much body fat.

As I have mentioned in other videos,

Weight loss in a short period of time is mostly due to the loss of body water.

Glycogen is stored with 3g of water for every 1g stored.

During the time we sleep, glycogen is consumed for energy.

In that case, the body will lose its body fluids.

Because of this, when I sleep and wake up, I want to go to the bathroom.

When you go to the bathroom, your weight tends to decrease significantly.

I have lost more than 7 kg in weight. This means that

This means that such a large amount of glycogen and water was stored in the body.

Since he is an athlete with a lot of muscle mass, it means he had a high glycogen storage capacity.

I will summarize.

If you increase your muscle mass through exercise, you can increase the total amount of glycogen that can be stored.

When you eat foods that make you gain weight, it helps prevent your blood sugar from rising.

It will have the effect of preventing weight gain.

This means that if you build muscle through exercise, you will develop a body type that doesn't gain weight.

If you want to have a body that doesn't gain weight, exercising is essential.

So having a lot of muscle mass means you become the type of body that doesn't gain weight, right?

When measuring with InBody, it shows that there is a lot of muscle mass in cases of severe obesity.

What happens in this case?

That's an interesting question, isn't it?

In the next video, I will talk about this.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 3 of the body type that doesn't gain weight,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
