Shouldn't the basal metabolic rate decrease at all during a diet?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I have been dieting for three months with a meal plan and home workouts, and as a result, my basal metabolic rate has decreased slightly.

I want to discuss this after seeing a comment asking if this is a problem.

First, let's take a look at the comments.

While binge-watching the video, I'm leaving a question for the first time.

I have been dieting for three months with a meal plan and home workouts.

When I checked with InBody, my skeletal muscle decreased by 0.5 kg and my body fat decreased by 5 kg.

Skeletal muscle has hardly decreased, and I am currently in the process of losing 5 kg of body fat.

The basal metabolic rate has slightly decreased from 1180 to 1140.

I know that the basal metabolic rate is the energy used by organs like the heart and brain, so it shouldn't decrease.

I'm curious whether this level of decrease is not acceptable or if it's okay.

This is a comment that says.

To put it simply, a slight decrease in basal metabolic rate is not a problem.

Basal metabolic rate refers to the energy expended by our body to maintain life.

As mentioned in the question, most of the energy is consumed by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

Now, let's take some time to think.

A person who is large and heavy and a person who is small and light.

Do these two people have the same basal metabolic rate?

Of course, it would be different.

To maintain a large and heavy body, more muscle is needed.

More muscles require more oxygen and energy.

To obtain more oxygen, the lungs need to work harder.

To obtain more energy, the digestive system needs to work harder.

Oxygen and energy travel through the blood.

As the body grows larger, it needs to send blood further, so the heart has to work harder.

If an organ does more work like this, the energy it consumes will increase.

So, even if the body simply grows larger, the energy required to maintain that body increases.

Simply put, when a person becomes larger and heavier due to obesity, their basal metabolic rate increases.

On the contrary, when the body becomes smaller and lighter due to dieting, it means that the basal metabolic rate decreases.

Therefore, it is a natural phenomenon for the basal metabolic rate to decrease while dieting.

If that's the case... why is it said that the basal metabolic rate shouldn't decrease when dieting?

It's not about the decrease in basal metabolic rate that comes with a smaller and lighter body.

It's a story about the response to hunger.

It is often said that following a low-calorie diet or starving oneself to lose weight can lead to a decrease in basal metabolic rate, which can cause problems.

By reducing calorie intake like this, if you put your body in a state of energy deficiency, then...

Our bodies respond by trying to lower the energy consumption in order to adapt to such situations.

We currently live in an environment where food is abundant, but...

Early humans who obtained food through hunting and gathering did not have an abundance of food.

To survive in such an environment, we had to adapt to a setting with limited food.

You can think of it as the power-saving mode of a smartphone.

When the smartphone's battery runs low, it enters power-saving mode.

Close unnecessary apps or dim the screen to reduce energy consumption.

So, it's trying to stay on a little longer with a low battery.

Similarly, in a situation where food is scarce, the body reduces the energy it consumes.

So this is a reaction to survive a little longer until the next food can be obtained.

It is a reaction that occurs in situations of hunger due to a lack of food, so it is also referred to as the hunger response.

It is similar to the power-saving mode of a smartphone, and it is also referred to as power-saving mode.

It is sometimes called "winter sleep mode" because it is similar to a bear hibernating.

This is completely different from the body becoming smaller and lighter, which leads to a decrease in basal metabolic rate.

This means that the required energy itself has decreased.

This is because the necessary energy has not been supplied.

To make it easier to understand, for example,

Using less electricity and therefore paying a lower electricity bill.

The difference is that I don't have money to pay the electricity bill, so the electricity gets cut off, and therefore I use less electricity.

These two things are completely different.

The first is a natural phenomenon.

The second one is because there was a problem.

This second one is the problem, so we need to be careful.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

A larger and heavier person's body requires more energy.

Therefore, the basal metabolic rate is high.

When the body becomes smaller and lighter from the second diet, the energy needed will decrease.

Therefore, the basal metabolic rate decreases, which is a natural phenomenon.

In the third diet, it is said that the basal metabolic rate should not decrease.

A low-calorie diet or starvation diet refers to the body's response to hunger.

So, if you are following a proper diet rather than a low-calorie diet or starving yourself,

A slight decrease in basal metabolic rate is a natural phenomenon, so you don't need to worry too much.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

So you're saying not to lose weight by eating less or starving myself?

But... then how do you diet?

If you understand the principles of dieting, you can lose weight while eating until you are full.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have a video explaining the principles and methods of dieting in detail at the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click here to see it.

I think my basal metabolic rate has already decreased because I've been on a low-calorie diet or fasting diet.

What should someone like me do?

In the past, a flight attendant asked a similar question, so I made a video answering it.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
