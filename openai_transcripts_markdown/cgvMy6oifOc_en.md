Reasons why a woman may not lose weight despite exercising regularly.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I have been exercising consistently, but I've received a message saying that the effects are diminishing.

I would like to talk about what the problem is.

First, let's read the content of the story.

Hello, pkang. I am someone who started watching your videos based on a friend's recommendation.

I am a woman in my mid-30s.

Other videos were amazing, but the video that surprised me the most was the one about body fat.

Before watching your video, I believed that dieting was 80% diet and 20% exercise.

I was only interested in my diet.

I don't really like exercising, and it's hard to find time to work out because I'm busy.

I thought it was better to focus on the 80% diet rather than forcing myself to do 20% exercise.

So when women accumulate body fat, it tends to accumulate primarily as subcutaneous fat.

I was very surprised to see a video stating that exercise is more effective than diet for reducing body fat.

After watching that video, I looked at my body and realized that I have a lot of subcutaneous fat.

I have been working hard on my diet until now, but I think I have figured out the reason why my weight loss efforts have always failed.

So I started exercising right away.

I didn't know because I wasn't interested, but there are really a lot of home workout videos on YouTube.

I found workout videos that can be done at home without disturbing neighbors with noise.

I have been doing it for three months.

At first, it was difficult to keep up with the speed of the movements in the video.

I'm getting more accustomed to it, so these days I'm following along without much difficulty.

However, I feel like the effect is gradually diminishing.

In the early stages of starting exercise, I definitely saw results and felt that my body shape was changing.

However, after a certain point, I don't really notice any effects.

What could be the problem?

This is a story with that content. Let's talk about it in detail.

First, let's go over the basic information.

The fat in our body is mainly divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat is the fat that is located right next to the internal organs.

It is fat that is advantageous for storing or supplying energy because it is close to and clustered around the organs.

It's a kind of energy storage.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is the fat located beneath the skin and is distributed throughout the body.

There is a distance between subcutaneous fat and visceral fat due to the presence of muscles and bones.

It's fat that is scattered throughout the body, making it difficult to utilize as energy.

Instead, it is located on the outermost part of the body, excluding the skin.

It protects the body from external shocks and has the effect of keeping the body warm to prevent heat loss.

You can think of it as clothing.

The only place in our body where the internal organs are located is the abdomen.

So when there is an increase in visceral fat, the belly tends to stick out.

At this time, the abdominal muscles that were blocking the internal organs and visceral fat also start to push out.

Therefore, the belly that results from visceral fat obesity has the characteristic of being firm.

Men's obesity typically takes this form.

On the other hand, subcutaneous fat is located outside of the muscles, so the muscles cannot hold it in place.

Therefore, it will stretch out due to gravity.

And it's scattered all over the body.

The soft and sagging flesh on areas like the belly, thighs, upper arms, and back is all subcutaneous fat.

Women's obesity mainly takes this form.

Stored energy in the form of visceral fat can be effectively reduced when following a diet.

Subcutaneous fat is a type of fat that is originally difficult to use for energy.

It's the fat that is effectively lost when you exercise rather than focusing on diet.

If you remember this information and read the story, you will understand the question of the person sharing their story.

The person sharing their story is a woman in her mid-30s and has a lot of subcutaneous fat.

So when I only focused on my diet without exercising, the weight loss effect was not very significant.

I started exercising after watching my video, and I've seen some results to a certain extent.

As time goes by, they say the effects gradually diminish.

The reason this happens is because of the way exercise is performed.

First of all, what is the reason that exercise is effective in reducing body fat?

It is for temperature regulation.

To move the human body, muscles need to be used.

However, using muscles generates heat within the body.

Humans are warm-blooded animals, which means that their body temperature must be maintained at a constant level.

It is not good if the body temperature drops too low, but it is also not good if it rises too high.

Then, what should we do about the heat generated in the body?

You need to transfer the heat from your body to your skin and sweat.

Sweat takes away heat from the skin during the evaporation process.

The heat from the muscles is transferred to the skin, and as the sweat on the skin evaporates, it takes the heat away.

By repeating this process, you are releasing the heat from your body to the outside.

However, there is an entity that prevents this.

It is the subcutaneous fat located between the skin and muscles.

The more subcutaneous fat there is, the harder it becomes to transfer heat through the skin.

This is the problem.

So, if you use a lot of muscles and generate a lot of heat in your body,

Our body tries to reduce subcutaneous fat, which interferes with regulating body temperature.

That's how body fat is lost.

However, a question arises here.

If you work hard on your abdominal exercises to generate a lot of heat in your abs,

Subcutaneous fat of the belly. So, shouldn't the belly fat be lost? That's what I'm saying.

According to the exercise knowledge we have, doing abdominal exercises diligently does not lead to losing belly fat.

Why is there such a difference?

Generally, when exercising, I work out for about an hour a day.

Even if I work out hard for an hour and generate heat in my abs,

Why doesn't the fat around the belly go away?

If you think about the fact that a day has 24 hours, the answer becomes clear.

Compared to the one hour of exercise that generates heat,

It's because the remaining time without exercising and generating heat is too long.

I understand that the time to generate heat is too short.

That said, you can't exercise for 8 or 10 hours a day.

Yes, that's right.

I'm not saying to exercise for 8 or 10 hours.

It means that we need to increase our daily activity levels.

It means to exercise hard for one hour a day and not to lie down for the rest of the time.

But with that concept, reducing body fat is not exercise but rather an increase in activity level, right?

Then, it's not that you have to exercise.

Isn't it important to increase your usual level of activity?

Yes, that's right.

However, increasing activity levels without exercise is nearly impossible.

Most people find it bothersome and do not exercise for even one hour a day.

However, if you have to maintain a high level of activity throughout the day, is that something you can do?

I can't do it.

That's why I'm telling you to exercise.

Let's take an example to make it easier to understand.

When trying to go from the first floor to the second floor.

Many people choose to wait for the elevator rather than climb the stairs.

Climbing stairs can be bothersome and tiring.

Now, let's imagine there is a person who exercises by climbing 100 floors of stairs every day.

The 100th floor feels extremely high, but

It takes about 10 minutes to climb from the 20th to the 30th floor.

Even considering breaks, it takes about 50 minutes to 1 hour to climb 100 floors.

Once you get used to it, your speed in climbing the stairs increases.

As your stamina increases, the rest periods become shorter.

If you keep at it consistently, you can climb all 100 floors in just 30 minutes.

For such a person, is climbing a one-story staircase from the first floor to the second floor a bothersome and difficult task?

No, it's very easy.

I exercise by climbing 100 floors every day.

In this case, some people choose to take the stairs instead of waiting for the elevator, even if it's just one floor.

Actually, it's quicker to take the stairs, but waiting for the elevator can be a hassle.

So, if you increase your muscle mass and build your stamina through exercise, moving your body will no longer be a difficult task.

It's not difficult to move the body, so naturally, the level of activity increases.

When the level of activity in daily life increases, heat is continuously generated within the body.

As heat continues to be generated in the body, the subcutaneous fat is burned off.

If you only focus on abdominal exercises, your abs will get stronger, but it won't increase your overall activity level.

It is more effective to do exercises that build muscle throughout the entire body, as this increases overall activity levels.

So it's said that doing full-body workouts is more effective than just doing abdominal exercises.

So the goal is to increase physical strength and muscle mass through exercise, which will lead to a higher level of activity, right?

But why is the effect gradually decreasing for the person sharing their story?

You've been exercising consistently for three months, right?

It is because I repeated the same exercise.

For example, if you consistently repeat walking exercises, it can become easier to walk.

However, running is still difficult.

The intensity of the exercise I do changes my body.

Once your body gets used to the exercise intensity, it will no longer change.

If the body doesn't change, the level of activity won't increase either.

If the level of activity does not increase, body fat will no longer decrease.

When I read the story again,

I have been following a home workout video without any noise from the neighbors that I found on YouTube for three months.

At first, it was difficult to follow the movements in the video, but

It is said that it has become easier recently.

It's time to increase the intensity of your workout.

However, since I am continuing to do the same exercise without increasing the intensity,

The body is no longer changing.

I've heard that exercise is effective for reducing body fat, so I am exercising, but...

If you don't know why you should exercise or misunderstand the purpose of exercise,

There are quite a few cases where this happens.

If we summarize the content so far into four points:

First, the body fat in our body is largely divided into visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

Exercising is effective for reducing body fat.

The purpose of doing the second exercise is to increase muscle mass and build stamina through exercise.

It is about making it so that moving the body is not a difficult task.

When it becomes easier to move your body, your activity level naturally increases.

With the increase in activity levels, the heat generated within the body continuously reduces subcutaneous fat.

The body grows according to the intensity of the fourth exercise.

If you repeat exercises of the same intensity, your body will not grow beyond a certain level.

If the body does not grow, the level of activity will no longer increase.

Therefore, it is advisable to gradually increase the intensity of your workouts through progressive overload until you achieve the body you desire.

It can be organized like this.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

It's interesting that if you misunderstand the reasons for exercising, it can lead to ineffective workouts even if you do exercise.

Is there another story like this?

There is a story about vegetables.

It is often said that vegetables are good for dieting because they are low in calories and have a large volume.

Many people think that the reason to eat vegetables is because they are bulky and low in calories.

However, in reality, it is not like that.

I used to make related videos in the past.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top left.

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

Women primarily accumulate body fat as subcutaneous fat.

To lose subcutaneous fat, you need to exercise.

Many women struggle with dieting by only focusing on their diet and not exercising because they don't know this.

Is there any other important information regarding women's diets?

There are two main points. I used to make videos in the past.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the top right.

If you're curious about this part, you can click to see it.

Since dieting is difficult, I've been thinking about trying diet pills.

What do you think about diet pills?

I had questions about diet pills, so I made a video about it.
