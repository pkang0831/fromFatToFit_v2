Usually, I'm fine, but when I diet, I get hungry.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

I usually don't have a big appetite.

When I try to diet, I see comments saying that suddenly cravings arise.

I would like to tell a story.

First, let's read the comments.

I don't eat food often or in large quantities, but...

I am a person with mild obesity, likely because I mainly eat instant food.

I usually don't have much of an appetite.

I can eat a little less or skip a meal without feeling too hungry.

When I decide to diet and control my calories, I get so hungry that I can't stand it.

I wondered if it was because of exercising, so I tried not exercising, but it didn't help.

My body has gotten used to instant food.

I wonder if it's a problem to eat diet foods like chicken breast or cabbage.

I tried dieting by eating the same instant foods I usually do, but by reducing the portion sizes a bit.

Still, the hunger was very intense.

Every time I try to diet, I end up overeating more than usual.

Actually, my weight has increased compared to before I started my diet.

No matter how much I think about it, I can't understand why this is happening.

This is a comment that says, "Please help me."

To put it simply, the issue arises from the perception of low calories.

There is an interesting experiment about how the perception of low calories can lead to changes in the body.

Dividing people into two groups.

One group is instructed to drink a beverage labeled as 620 kcal.

After having them drink a beverage labeled as 140 kcal for another group,

When comparing the ghrelin hormone levels of the two groups,

The group that consumed a 140 kcal beverage showed higher levels of the hormone ghrelin.

The ghrelin hormone is the hormone that makes you feel hungry.

The statement that ghrelin hormone levels were measured to be high means that hunger was felt more intensely.

So, compared to the group that drank a 620 kcal beverage,

The group that drank a 140 kcal beverage felt hungrier.

Since I drank a low-calorie beverage, isn't it natural that I'm feeling hungrier?

Yes, that's right.

The problem is that the calories listed on the beverage were different from the actual calories.

In fact, the drinks consumed by both groups were the same beverage, each containing 380 kcal.

So the drink I'm having right now has low calories.

Therefore, if you perceive that drinking this beverage will not satisfy your hunger,

It means that regardless of the actual calories in that beverage, one feels a significant sense of hunger.

In the same context, I am intentionally eating low-calorie meals for my diet.

If you perceive that your hunger won't be satisfied because you are eating low-calorie meals,

That means you could feel very hungry because of it.

So when I'm hungry, I just think I can eat more.

Even if I eat less or skip meals, I'm not very hungry.

If you eat low-calorie meals for dieting, your hunger increases.

In some cases, overeating can actually lead to weight gain.

If that's the case, then everyone on a low-calorie diet feels severe hunger.

So, shouldn't you be unable to diet?

However, there are many people who are dieting with a low-calorie diet.

Yes, that's right.

Just as there are people who are easily influenced by self-suggestion or hypnosis and those who are not.

There are people who are greatly affected by their thoughts on their bodies, and those who are not.

And thoughts affect the body.

Even if the secretion of the ghrelin hormone increases and hunger arises,

Some people can endure that hunger with willpower, but there are also those who cannot.

In a situation where you are actually hungry, when you eat a small amount of food.

Some people say that after eating even a little bit, their hunger decreases and they feel better.

Some people say that eating just a little makes them feel even more unsatisfied and increases their hunger, causing them distress.

It means that there are differences among people.

So to summarize,

When I was trying to follow a low-calorie diet.

Rather, some people overeat because their hunger intensifies.

Not everyone on a low-calorie diet experiences these symptoms, but...

When I decided to go on a diet and reduced my food intake, I felt an unusually intense hunger.

If that is the reason you keep failing at your diet,

That person is someone whose thoughts have a significant impact on their body.

It means that they are a person who cannot resist the hunger caused by the ghrelin hormone.

It is better for such people to avoid low-calorie diets as much as possible.

You need to change your diet method.

I understand that a low-calorie diet is not good, but...

So what should someone like me do to diet?

You don't need to restrict calories; you can change the types of food you eat.

By changing the types of food you eat, you can lose weight without having to restrict calories.

I explained in detail in another video how to change the types of food you eat.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

It's fascinating how thoughts can affect the body and hinder dieting.

Is there no case where thinking in the opposite way can help with dieting?

There is.

There are cases where simply changing one's mindset has led to successful dieting.

I explained this in detail in a video before.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.
