I heard that pasta is a good food for dieting. Is that true?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

Flour-based foods are not good for dieting, but

Pasta is made from a special type of wheat called durum wheat, which is why it is good for dieting.

This is information that can be found quite commonly on the internet.

A story has come up asking for opinions on this, so I would like to discuss it a bit.

First, let's read the story.

I am a woman with diabetes.

I maintained a ketogenic state while also losing a lot of weight on the diet.

I joined a ketogenic cafe and studied a lot, and I used to trust that diet a lot.

Recently, I watched pkang's YouTube and changed my diet to the pkang diet.

As Ronka said, the ketogenic diet was difficult to maintain.

There have been times of stagnation, skin troubles, and issues with my menstrual cycle.

These days, I am easing my extreme doubts about carbohydrates and not obsessing over being in a ketogenic state.

I am doing my diet in a relatively healthy way.

Recently, I saw a video on YouTube that said pasta is a better complex carbohydrate than sweet potatoes.

Sweet potatoes contain 32% carbohydrates in 100g, which includes a mix of complex sugars and simple sugars.

The content was that pasta is mostly complex carbohydrates.

The wheat used to make pasta is a special variety called durum wheat, and I knew that it has a low glycemic index, but...

According to the classification of the long-term diet, it's a refined food that I don't even look at.

Pasta has more carbohydrates than sweet potatoes per 100g, so it's said that you can adjust the portion size when consuming it.

Isn't pasta a refined food, but not a fattening one?

It's a question about this kind of content, so let's discuss it in detail.

First of all, many people misunderstand that even eating a little bit of refined food will lead to weight gain.

There are no foods in this world that make you gain weight when eaten in moderation. It’s overeating that causes weight gain.

To be able to eat a lot of food that cannot be eaten in large quantities.

To increase the nutritional density of low-nutrient foods.

Foods that are slow to digest and absorb should be made to digest and absorb more quickly.

Food that has been processed in this way is called refined food.

Such processed foods can be easily consumed in large quantities, and

It has a high nutritional density, so it provides a lot of nutrients to the body.

It's easy to digest and absorb, which is why so many nutrients are absorbed in a short amount of time, leading to problems.

To help with understanding, let's take an example: we can compare brown rice, white rice, and rice cakes.

If some of the rice husk is left on, it becomes brown rice.

When all the husk is removed, it becomes white rice.

You grind white rice into powder, then mold it again and steam it to make rice cakes.

First of all, there is not much difference in nutritional content between brown rice and white rice.

The only difference is whether there is a shell or not; in the end, both are rice.

However, this shell causes a difference in the speed of digestion and absorption.

The carbohydrates we eat are digested and absorbed, turning into glucose.

This glucose travels through the blood.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is called blood sugar.

When the carbohydrates I eat are digested and absorbed, the glucose in my blood increases, causing my blood sugar to rise.

When comparing the increase in blood sugar per hour after consuming the same amount of carbohydrates,

You can find out which foods have carbohydrates that are quickly digested and absorbed.

What quantifies this is the glycemic index. So, it's the GI index.

The GI index of white rice is over 80, but

The GI index of brown rice is around 50 to 60.

So, the amount of carbohydrates in white rice and brown rice is similar, but...

The speed at which those carbohydrates are absorbed by the body is different.

White rice has no husk, so it can be digested and absorbed quickly.

The husk of brown rice hinders digestion and absorption, which is why digestion and absorption are slow.

Due to this difference, when a person who used to eat white rice eats brown rice,

Even if the amount of carbohydrates consumed is the same, the amount absorbed per hour is different.

That's how dieting works.

This time, let's take a look at rice cakes.

Rice cakes are made by grinding white rice into flour and then kneading it back together.

During that process, compression occurs, and as a result, the nutritional density increases.

If you actually compare the nutritional components,

The carbohydrate content in 100g of white rice is about 31g.

Rice cake made from white rice contains 52g of carbohydrates per 100g.

The weight is the same, but the amount of carbohydrates, which are nutrients, has increased significantly.

It is said that this has increased in nutritional density.

If you eat the same amount of brown rice and white rice, the total amount of carbohydrates consumed is the same.

When you eat the same amount of rice cake, the amount of carbohydrates you consume is actually higher.

The problem is not that I eat more rice cakes than rice.

The problem is that even if you eat the same amount of rice and rice cakes, the nutrients that enter your body increase.

Now let's take a look at pasta.

In the initial part of the video, there was a statement that sweet potatoes contain 32% carbohydrates.

So, that means there are 32g of carbohydrates in 100g of sweet potato.

In that case, how many carbohydrates are there per 100g of pasta?

It is 66g.

The carbohydrate content is more than twice that of sweet potatoes and even higher than that of rice cakes.

Processed foods that are refined allow us to consume large quantities so easily.

It's dangerous because you can easily eat a large amount.

Of course, it is true that durum wheat, which is the main ingredient in pasta, has a low GI index.

However, just because a carbohydrate has a low GI index doesn't mean it's okay to eat a lot of it.

Eating too much can cause problems.

So in the video that the questioner is referring to...

In 100g of pasta, there are more carbohydrates than in sweet potatoes.

It contains information that you need to adjust the amount you consume.

The amount needs to be adjusted. That part is the key.

So, in the end, does that mean it's okay if you adjust the portion of pasta you eat?

Yes, that's right.

Then let's adjust the amount of pasta and give it a try.

How much should I eat?

I saw a video on YouTube where someone ate pasta and said they were on a diet.

The man eats about 80g per meal.

I understand that the pasta served in restaurants that offer course meals is typically 65 to 80 grams per serving.

So, how much is 80g of pasta in terms of quantity?

A photo of spaghetti aglio e olio made with 85g of spaghetti has been posted in a Korean community.

There were many reactions indicating that the quantity was insufficient.

Isn't that enough to eat with just one forkful? How many servings have I eaten?

My friend said, "Is that a tasting portion?" but it was actually the regular amount!

So that's why when I go to restaurants, the pasta always comes out in such tiny portions.

For your reference, in restaurants that serve course meals,

Since there are other dishes before and after the pasta, it's fine to consider that amount as a single serving.

There is also a claim that 80g is insufficient to eat just one serving of pasta without any other food.

In fact, in Korea, some restaurants that only serve pasta offer 130 to 150 grams as a single serving.

The carbohydrates included here are approximately 80 to 100 grams.

The amount of carbohydrates consumed in one meal is quite large.

However, this is a figure that only calculates the carbohydrates in the surface.

Pasta necessarily includes sauce, and that sauce also contains carbohydrates.

I will summarize.

If you ask, "Is pasta a refined food?"

My answer is "yes."

In fact, pasta is a food with a very high nutritional density that is made through processing.

If you ask, "Is pasta a food that makes you gain weight even if you eat just a little?"

My answer is "no."

However, it's not because the pasta is special.

Eating just a little bit of any food other than pasta won't make you gain weight.

The reason I say I need to reduce processed foods is that

It's not because even a little bit of processed food makes you gain weight.

It has the characteristic of being able to eat a large amount easily, and that's why it becomes a problem.

When you consume a lot of nutrients from processed foods,

It doesn't just end with gaining more weight.

It increases appetite, making you eat more food.

About 80g of pasta is enough for a meal for me.

You don't have to eat any more food.

Such a person can eat pasta without any worries.

However, it's not enough with 80g, so I'm eating about 150g to 200g.

Pasta is made from a special type of wheat called durum wheat, which has a low GI index. It's a diet food.

You shouldn't think like this.

Eating too much of any food can lead to problems.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

You mentioned that foods with a high GI index are digested and absorbed quickly.

Potatoes have a very high GI index of 90.

What are people who diet with potatoes?

In this video, it was mentioned that pasta has a low GI index, but we need to be careful because it contains a lot of carbohydrates.

Potatoes have a high GI index, unlike pasta, but they are low in carbohydrate content.

So it's okay.

I previously made a detailed explanation video because the same question came up.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have related videos displayed in the top left.

If you would like more detailed information, you can click here to see it.

When you wrap things up at the end.

You mentioned that processed foods increase appetite, leading to eating more.

What does this mean?

When we eat food and nutrients enter our bodies,

Hormones that process those nutrients are released.

If a lot of nutrients come in a short time through processed food,

There will be problems with hormone metabolism.

So, my appetite increases, and I end up eating more and more food.

This is one of the biggest reasons why we become obese.

In the past, I explained how to distinguish between refined and unrefined foods in detail.

When you study dieting, you'll find that there are really a variety of methods for dieting.

The principle behind why a person gains weight and how dieting works is likely the same, but why are there so many different dieting methods?

I previously made a video answering the same question.
