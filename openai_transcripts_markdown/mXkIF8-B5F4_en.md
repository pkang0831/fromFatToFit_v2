There is a dilemma with diet plans.

In a typical diet plan, there are nutrients that are considered to be the causes of obesity.

The goal is to consume that nutrient in smaller amounts.

In a low-fat diet, fat is seen as a cause of obesity, so people try to eat less fat.

In a low-carbohydrate diet, carbohydrates are viewed as a cause of obesity, so people try to eat less of them.

However, this type of diet has the issue that you have to manage your diet for a lifetime.

If the cause of obesity is indeed fat, then not eating less fat will lead to weight gain.

If carbohydrates are indeed the cause of obesity, then not eating fewer carbohydrates will lead to weight gain.

The problem is that no one wants to manage their diet for a lifetime.

However, there is no one who wants to remain obese without managing their diet.

This is the dilemma of a diet plan.

It is one of the concerns of people who are on a diet.

Recently, on my channel, there has been

I want to diet, but I don't want to eat diet food for the rest of my life.

Such comments have also been posted.

However, it is not necessary to manage your diet for a lifetime in order to stay slim.

If you diet correctly, you can eat what you want and still live slim.

The dilemma of a diet plan assumes that if one does not manage their diet, they will become obese.

However, in reality, there are quite a few people who maintain a slim body without managing their diet.

That's right! My friend also eats fatty foods often, but they are slim.

What is the difference between me and my friend?

The amount of food eaten varies.

A slim person will stop eating when they are full, even if there is food left.

There is a saying that people who are obese continue to eat even when they are full if there is food available.

There is a problem here.

The human body naturally releases hunger hormones when it needs food, making us want to eat.

When you eat enough food, satiety hormones are released, which make you stop eating.

Slim people have a normal hormonal metabolism.

When you eat a certain amount of food, you feel full.

Since I am full, I stop eating to avoid overeating.

I don't gain weight because I don't overeat.

Obesity occurs because a person's hormone metabolism does not function properly.

I am full from eating a lot, but eating more will lead to obesity.

Even after eating a sufficient amount of food, feeling hungry again is called false hunger.

It's not that I'm hungry because I need food.

It's just that you're feeling hungry because there is a problem with hormone metabolism.

I need to eliminate this fake hunger. I can eat what I want and still live slim.

Is that really possible?

Yes, it is possible.

In success stories about dieting, there are mentions of the stomach shrinking.

Overweight people liked foods that made them gain weight and became obese because they often ate a lot of those foods.

After successfully dieting, I don't really want to eat foods like that anymore.

Even if I eat, I can't eat a lot.

It's not that I'm forcing myself to hold back from eating what I want.

I don't feel like eating, or after eating a certain amount, I don't want to eat anymore.

Even if I try to eat a lot, I can't because I'm full.

Before starting the diet, I was able to eat a sufficient amount.

I'm too full to eat right now.

I think my stomach has shrunk, so I say that my stomach has gotten smaller.

In fact, that phenomenon is not caused by the stomach shrinking.

It is a phenomenon that occurs when false hunger disappears.

The human stomach is essentially an elastic organ that can expand and contract.

And what determines the size of this portion is appetite.

Even if you eat a lot of food and your stomach is full,

If you have a desire to eat more, your stomach expands to allow you to eat more.

Does that even make sense?

That makes sense.

In fact, Korean TV broadcasts have shown the appearance of the stomach expanding.

First, we fed the participants a hearty meal of meat and rice and then conducted a stomach scan.

Then I could see that there was only a small space left, marked by a yellow dotted line.

In fact, the experiment participants said they were so full that they couldn't eat anything more.

However, at that moment, when the experiment participants were shown their favorite cheesecake,

The stomach expands to create space.

In the end, the experiment participants also ate cheesecake.

So even if you eat a lot of food,

If there is false hunger, the stomach expands, leading to eating more food.

If you keep eating like this, your body fat will increase and you will become obese.

On the contrary, if there is no false hunger,

After eating a certain amount of food, I no longer want to eat more.

Since I have no appetite to eat, my stomach doesn't expand.

Since the stomach doesn't expand, you can't eat because you're full.

So, which nutrients are the cause of obesity?

Therefore, from the perspective that it should be restricted,

You have to live a life that restricts that nutrient for a lifetime because eating it will make you gain weight.

So, you have to manage your diet for a lifetime.

If you don't like that, instead of restricting nutrients,

I need to normalize my body's hormone metabolism to eliminate false hunger.

Then I can eat what I want and still stay slim.

This is the correct diet.

So how do you get the body back to normal?

It seems like there's a story about being able to become a body type that doesn't gain weight...

The number of fat cells that store fat is determined in childhood.

So, a person who was obese in childhood

I have heard that it's impossible to change a body type that easily gains weight for a lifetime.

I have been obese since I was young.

Can someone like me become someone who doesn't gain weight if I eliminate false hunger?

I have already made a video answering the two questions.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

On the left, there should be a video about the causes of false hunger and solutions for it.

I will make sure to have a video about a body type that doesn't gain weight on the right side.

You can choose and watch the video that you're curious about from the two options.
