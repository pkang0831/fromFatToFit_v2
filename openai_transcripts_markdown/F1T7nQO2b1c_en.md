Do you want to diet without stress? - Cheating Day Part 5

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the fifth video about cheating day.

In the last video, we discussed the types and effects of cheat days.

And I mentioned the reason why a cheat day is necessary when dieting.

What is known as the effect of a cheating day is logically flawed or an illusion.

Therefore, a cheat day was not necessary when dieting.

Rather, there are problems that arise from having a cheat day.

It is good to diet without cheat days.

Many people find it difficult to diet without a cheat day.

Dieting is very difficult and challenging, which causes me stress.

If there were no cheat days to relieve that stress, dieting would seem too difficult.

However, the problem is that dieting while being stressed in the first place is an issue.

You can diet without stress.

In this video, I will talk about stress-free dieting methods.

The reasons why stress occurs when dieting can be broadly categorized into three main factors.

It's about discomfort, the amount of food, and the taste of the food.

First, the stress caused by discomfort arises from changes in lifestyle patterns.

For example, people who are not on a diet mostly buy and eat food.

Even if you say you make it yourself, you still eat simple instant foods.

When you start a diet, you need to change your lifestyle patterns.

You need to make the food yourself and eat it.

In this case, time that was originally not required will be added, and labor that was not necessary will have to be done.

This becomes stressful because it is bothersome and inconvenient.

Humans have an instinct to avoid stress, even unconsciously.

So even if there is a diet plan that allows you to eat deliciously and feel full,

When stress arises from discomfort, there is a tendency to not want to stick to that diet.

This is the problem.

The diet itself isn't difficult, but if making and eating that diet is too bothersome, then...

This is where the problem is occurring.

I recently made a video about how to solve this.

I will make sure to include the related video link at the top right.

The stress caused by the quantity and taste of food is stress that arises from the same source.

The reason for that is the perception that in order to diet, one must restrict nutrients.

For example, to lose weight, you need to reduce your calorie intake.

If you follow a low-calorie diet based on this idea,

To lower calorie intake, one should eat less food or limit fat.

If you eat less food, you won't feel full, which can lead to stress from hunger.

When you restrict fat, your desire for fat increases.

I want to eat foods with a rich and oily flavor, like stir-fried dishes and fried foods that are high in fat.

I get stressed because I can't eat food with that kind of flavor.

The cause of obesity is too many carbohydrates, so if you want to lose weight, you need to limit carbohydrates.

If you follow a low-carbohydrate diet based on this idea,

Restricting carbohydrates increases the desire for them.

So I want to eat grain foods like rice or bread, or sweet foods like sugar.

I have to endure not being able to eat it, which causes stress.

This type of stress, unlike the stress caused by the discomfort mentioned earlier,

Because food is the cause, stress relief is only possible by eating food.

So it seems like a cheating day is necessary.

However, there is no need to go on a diet while experiencing that much stress in the first place.

Overeating, or consuming too much food, is a cause of obesity.

This is a clear fact.

Eating a lot of fat is the problem.

Eating a lot of carbohydrates is a problem.

The problem itself is eating too much of anything.

There are differences in the claims made by each theory of diet plans, but...

The idea that eating too much can be a problem is a common theme in any diet.

However, if eating a lot is the problem, then you just need to avoid eating a lot.

For example, even water, which is good for health, can be unhealthy if consumed in excess.

So when I said that drinking too much water is not good for health,

In that case, for my health, I will only drink one glass of water a day from now on.

If possible, I will not drink any water at all.

It can be surprising to react like this.

The same goes for dieting.

If eating a lot is the problem, then you just need to avoid eating a lot.

The less you eat, the greater the diet effect is not necessarily true.

So you're saying to eat a balanced diet, right? I know that it's good for my health.

That's a way to avoid gaining weight, not a method for dieting.

To diet, don't you have to eat less of calories, fat, and carbohydrates?

You need to eat less to use body fat, and that's how you lose weight.

There is an error in that thought.

In reality, you can lose body fat and diet without eating insufficiently.

It means that there is no need to eat less in the first place.

However, many people are unaware of this fact or

In my eagerness to lose weight quickly, I'm trying to eat less.

That's why side effects occur.

I gave up on my diet because I was overwhelmed with stress.

Due to a sense of compensation, binge eating is done under the name of "cheat day."

A decrease in basal metabolic rate leading to weight regain is all a side effect.

Dieting is naturally difficult.

Of course, dieting can cause stress.

If you want to diet, a cheat day is definitely necessary.

It's natural for yo-yo effects to occur when dieting, so lifelong management is necessary.

You need to let go of this kind of thinking.

That way, you can diet without stress.

Then you can lose weight without eating less.

Are you saying that you can still lose weight even if you add seasonings like salt and sugar to make it taste good?

Is that possible?

Yes, it is possible.

I talked in detail about how that is possible in another video.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

On the left, set up a video explaining the principle of reducing body fat without eating less.

I will make sure to display a video about salt and sugar on the right.
