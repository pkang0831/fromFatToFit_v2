The topic of this video is about following a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.

What should I do if I don't want to eat fat and only want to eat vegetables? This is a video answering that question.

Before I made this video, I created the previous video.

I made a video asking whether a low-carb, high-fat diet can cause fat-related side effects.

When first encountering a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, the most common concern is

Side effects of eating too few carbohydrates.

The second issue is that consuming too much fat leads to side effects.

There are many testimonials about the side effects that come from eating too much fat.

This is a video about the reasons why such side effects occur and how to prevent them from happening.

The link to the video is displayed in the upper right corner.

Looking at the comments on this video,

I don't want to eat fat, but carbohydrates...

It must be talking about vegetables, since it's discussing a low-carb, high-fat diet.

If you don't want to eat fat and only want to eat carbohydrates and vegetables, what should you do?

To explain this question, let's take a look at it.

I have talked a lot about the fundamental concept of a low-carb, high-fat diet over the past period.

It was said that it is a diet where the calories obtained from fat are greater than those obtained from carbohydrates.

It's fine to reduce the amount of fat, but there are times when you just don't want to eat it at all.

When I really feel like eating only pure vegetables.

In such cases, if you just follow what your body tells you and end up eating only vegetables,

The question is whether it's okay to have a low-carb, high-fat diet when there is no fat intake at all.

To answer your question, I don't want to eat meat, oil, or stir-fried dishes at all.

If you purely want to eat only vegetables and fruits, you can do that.

Why is it okay to do that?

What the person asking is worried about is if they keep eating only carbohydrates.

You are worried that it might not be a low-carb, high-fat diet.

I can't keep eating like that.

If you keep eating mainly vegetables or fruits, you'll eventually start craving meat again.

If you only eat meat, you'll eventually start craving vegetables or fruits.

This is because our body tries to maintain balance.

There are actually a lot of real examples.

When you see celebrities and models who need to drastically lose weight, their diets consist of vegetables and fruits.

You only eat salad, right?

Since dressing contains fat, I only eat vegetables without adding any.

In such cases, this person really wants to eat meat.

I don't remember exactly because I only glanced at the article.

I'm not sure if it's a fitness model or a clothing model.

You need to reach your target weight by a certain time, so you've only been eating salads.

I don't know if the competition, fashion show, and weight measurement are over, but after this is finished...

An article was published saying that they went straight to a barbecue restaurant and cried because the meat was so delicious.

If you only eat this, you'll start craving meat. There are so many real-life examples of this.

On the contrary, if you only eat meat, you will eventually crave fruits and vegetables.

Eating only meat without vegetables and fruits is the ketogenic diet, right?

Only consuming fats and proteins.

What these people want to eat the most are sweet fruits and vegetables that can balance out the greasiness.

If you want more, you also want to eat a lot of grains.

Right now, I don't want to eat fat, and I feel like I only want to eat carbohydrates.

My body's nutritional status indicates that I have a lot of fat and protein, but a deficiency in carbohydrates.

If all three of these conditions are met, you will not feel hungry.

Wanting to eat food but not wanting fat means that you are lacking only carbohydrates.

Please only consume carbohydrates according to this condition.

If you feel like eating meat again while eating like this, you can have meat then.

You understand, right?
