Reasons for Binge Eating Even with No Issues in Diet - Eating Disorders Part 8

This is the eighth video about eating disorders.

In the first video, it was mentioned that there are three main causes of binge eating.

Binge eating caused by insulin

Binge eating due to insufficient meal intake.

It is binge eating caused by mental issues.

Binge eating due to mental issues can be further divided into three categories.

Binge eating due to low self-esteem.

Binge eating due to lack of physical activity.

It's binge eating caused by loneliness.

In this video, I will talk about binge eating caused by a decline in self-esteem.

Most people with obesity tend to have low self-esteem.

I dislike my fat appearance.

When there are people around, it feels like everyone is looking at my body.

I often feel that people are talking behind my back or laughing at me.

This feeling causes a decrease in self-esteem.

When self-esteem decreases, feelings of depression tend to come rushing in.

I often try to solve this sadness by eating food.

Eating sweet foods makes me feel happy.

Eating spicy food gives me a feeling of stress relief.

When you eat a lot of food, you feel a sense of satisfaction.

I'm trying to forget my sadness with this kind of feeling.

So even if there are no issues with the diet,

When self-esteem is low, there are quite a few cases where people seek out unhealthy foods and binge eat.

I want to diet, but I end up binge eating and that makes me feel worse about myself, lowering my self-esteem even more.

But really, other people are looking at my fat body.

Are they laughing and cursing behind my back?

There is an interesting experiment related to this.

How would people react if someone with a scar on their face went on a blind date?

After recruiting participants with this experiment title,

A special makeup was applied to the participant's face to create scars.

The experimenter shows the participant in the mirror that there is a scar on their face.

Just before going on a blind date.

I said I would fix my makeup since it had smudged a bit from sweat, and then I wiped it off.

So the experiment participants think that there is scar makeup on their faces, but...

In reality, everything has been erased.

In fact, this experiment is not about observing the reactions of those around a person with scars on their face when they go on a blind date, but rather...

In reality, there are no scars.

It was an experiment on how people with scars perceive the gaze of those around them.

During the experiment, I closely observed the participants.

I often saw the gesture of raising a hand to cover the area where the scar makeup was applied.

Even if you know that it is not a real scar but makeup,

Thinking that the people around me are watching, I unconsciously want to hide.

After the experiment was completed, interviews were conducted with the participants.

I often felt that my date and the people around us were staring at my scars.

I wanted to cover the scar because of that, and I said I felt very withdrawn.

However, before starting the blind date, I had already removed the scar makeup.

The gaze that the participant felt was actually just an illusion.

Obesity is the same.

When I stand in front of people, it feels like everyone is just looking at my body.

I have a feeling that they are laughing at me and cursing me behind my back.

This feeling could actually be an illusion.

Don't worry too much about what others think, and don't belittle yourself.

Such thoughts lower self-esteem.

A lowered self-esteem leads to binge eating.

This binge eating interferes with my diet.

In other words, if I boost my self-esteem,

Binge eating due to low self-esteem has decreased.

Just eliminating such binge eating can be a huge help for dieting.

In the next video, I will talk about binge eating caused by a lack of physical activity.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.
