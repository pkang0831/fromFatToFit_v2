Does cold weather make you lose weight? Is it good for dieting?

In this video, we will discuss whether living in a cold environment is helpful for dieting.

First, the body fat in our body is divided into subcutaneous fat and visceral fat.

The fat that we commonly refer to as "flesh," which hangs down and jiggles, is subcutaneous fat.

The fat that makes the belly swell up big and firm like a balloon is visceral fat.

In the last video, I mentioned that when you live in a cold environment, your body temperature drops quickly.

To prevent a drop in body temperature, subcutaneous fat increases.

It was said that in order to raise the lowering body temperature, energy is used while reducing visceral fat.

To make it easier to understand, let me give you an example.

When it's cold, you need to wear warm clothes and eat warm food.

The role of clothing is played by subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat provides energy instead of warm food.

The common saying you often see on the internet that you lose weight when it's cold refers to visceral fat.

However, there is one blind spot in this story.

First, in order to raise the body temperature that drops due to the cold, the metabolic rate increases.

It is true that an increased metabolic rate leads to a reduction in visceral fat.

There is actually such research.

The issue is the duration of the study.

Do early studies suggest that cold temperatures help reduce visceral fat?

Since we focused on this part, we conducted experiments over a short period of time.

The experiment results showed that visceral fat decreased.

And based on this result, the saying that you lose weight when it's cold has spread.

However, a question was raised about whether the reduction of visceral fat that occurs when it gets cold is maintained afterwards.

We conducted the experiment again over a long period of time.

The results show that my weight has increased again.

So in the short term, energy is used to raise the lowered body temperature while reducing visceral fat.

It means that over time, there is a response to replenish the reduced visceral fat.

I have a video titled "The Reason Why You Don't Lose Weight Even When You Do High-Calorie Burning Exercises."

You can think of it as being exactly the same as the mechanism shown in that video.

If you reduce the amount of food you eat, you will decrease the amount of energy that enters your body.

As energy decreases, weight will drop accordingly.

The diet that comes from this kind of thinking is a low-calorie diet.

However, when you actually follow a low-calorie diet, you do lose body fat to make up for the lack of energy.

In situations where energy is lacking, the body also reduces the energy it consumes.

If you lose weight by starving yourself, your basal metabolic rate decreases, making it easier for you to gain weight.

Similarly, if you increase the energy expended through exercise and create an energy deficit,

You will lose weight according to the amount of energy deficit.

From this perspective, I believe that when dieting, one should engage in exercises that burn a lot of calories.

In reality, the body changes according to the calories burned through exercise.

You may eat more food because your appetite has increased.

Even if you eat the same amount of food, you can absorb more.

The rate at which absorbed energy is converted into body fat increases.

The level of activity decreases during times other than exercise.

A reaction is observed that reduces energy consumed elsewhere.

Living in the cold is the same.

If you increase the energy consumed by living in a cold environment, it will temporarily reduce visceral fat.

Increased appetite or absorbing more.

Increased conversion to body fat or reducing the energy consumed through activity, etc.

It means that they are trying to increase visceral fat again in various ways.

So in the short term, visceral fat decreases, but...

Over time, the reduced visceral fat will be restored.

No one diets for just a short period of time.

So living in a cold environment does not necessarily help with dieting.

Rather, in the long term, it leads to an increase in body fat.

Living in a cold environment is actually not good for dieting.

The topic of the video is whether living in a cold environment is helpful for dieting.

Living in a cold environment does not help with dieting.

At this point where this conclusion is reached, the video should end, but...

During that time, ending videos on such topics led to a lot of comments.

So what do you want to say? Is it just that it can't be done?

If I can't eat less and I can't exercise, then how am I supposed to diet?

Answers to such questions have already been provided in other videos.

First, let's talk about your diet. You need to change the types of food you eat.

Dieting doesn't mean you have to avoid food or starve yourself.

I need to eat foods that help me lose weight, not foods that make me gain weight.

Regarding which foods cause weight gain and which foods promote weight loss,

I covered the methods for distinguishing between fattening foods and weight-loss foods in the video.

There is already a video for the second exercise as well.

First, there are videos about spot reduction for body fat.

This is a video explaining how exercising helps in reducing body fat.

And regarding visceral fat, it was covered in a video about exercises effective for reducing body fat.

Regardless of the calories burned through exercise

Moving your body itself helps reduce visceral fat.

The videos I just mentioned all have links in the top right corner.

I will also leave the video link in the description below.
