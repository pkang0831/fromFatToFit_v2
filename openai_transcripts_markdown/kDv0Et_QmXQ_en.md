I would rather starve and lose weight than eat tasteless food.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

Recently, I made a video that explains the principles of dieting in detail.

In that video, it was mentioned that the type of food you eat is important for dieting.

Changing the types of food you eat can lead to weight loss without having to eat less or starve.

A comment like this was posted: "I would rather starve and lose weight than eat tasteless food."

So, I interpreted the advice to change the types of food I eat as being told to eat tasteless food.

I don't want to eat food that doesn't taste good anyway.

I am not interested in dieting while eating such food to my heart's content.

I would rather reduce the amount I eat or even go hungry, but I want to diet while enjoying delicious food.

It's that kind of story.

However, changing the types of food you eat does not mean you should eat tasteless food.

You can eat it deliciously.

But why did I accept that I should eat bad food?

Diet food is not tasty.

Eating delicious food makes it hard to stick to a diet.

To diet, you have to eat tasteless food.

This is because of such awareness.

The foods that are actually eaten for dieting are

I think we should use less sugar and salt, or that it should be low in calories.

Foods that have low sweetness from sugar, low saltiness from salt, and low calories tend to taste bland.

However, you don't have to eat something that tastes bad in order to lose weight.

There’s no need to eat like that.

In this video, we will explore why there is a perception that one must eat tasteless food in order to diet.

And I will talk about which parts of that perception have errors.

The first is salt. Specifically, it is about seasonings that have a salty taste.

When it comes to a diet plan, many people often think of a low-sodium diet.

The reason for this perception is the speed at which the body changes.

The human body always tries to maintain a consistent concentration of sodium.

If you consume a lot of salt, the sodium in your body increases.

Increase the body water to adjust the concentration.

If you eat less salt, the sodium in your body will decrease.

Reduce the moisture content to adjust the concentration.

However, this moisture also has weight and volume.

When body water increases, body weight increases by the amount of the increased body water.

The body becomes thicker by the volume of the increased body water.

Conversely, if body water decreases, weight will drop by the amount of the reduced body water.

The body becomes slimmer as the volume of reduced body water decreases.

It's not body fat that's being lost, but body water. So it can't really be considered a diet.

Since my weight is decreasing and my body is getting slimmer,

Many people mistakenly think that losing body water through a low-sodium diet is dieting.

Rather, the rate at which body water is lost is much faster compared to the rate at which body fat is lost.

A low-sodium diet leads to faster weight loss.

To diet, it is essential to follow a low-sodium diet.

Such diet tips are being shared.

In fact, many people lose weight and their bodies become slimmer when they follow a low-sodium diet.

There is a growing perception that a low-sodium diet is essential for weight loss.

However, if you go into the sauna and sweat, resulting in a weight loss of 1 kg,

Can this be called a diet?

Of course not.

It's not body fat that has been lost, but body water.

It's because drinking water restores it back to normal immediately.

The weight loss achieved through a low-sodium diet is the same.

It's not body fat that has been lost, but body water.

If you don't follow a low-sodium diet, you will return to your original state.

So the perception that a low-sodium diet is good for weight loss is

It's a misunderstanding that losing body water is mistaken for weight loss.

However, in another video, you mentioned that eating a lot of salt increases appetite.

So if you follow a low-sodium diet, your appetite decreases, and isn't that good for dieting?

For Russian astronauts

When the amount of salt consumed gradually increased

There was an experiment to observe what reactions occur in the body.

If you consume a lot of salt, you need to increase your body water to balance the sodium concentration.

Therefore, it was expected that a thirst for water would arise.

However, in reality, the result showed that it was not thirst, but rather a feeling of hunger wanting to eat food.

There are two reasons why this happens.

The first reason is that the food we eat itself contains moisture.

In reality, when a person needs water, they may sometimes feel hunger instead of thirst.

If you're hungry because of this, first drink a glass of water.

Could you check if you might be confusing thirst with hunger?

There is a saying that drinking water frequently can eliminate hunger caused by thirst, which is good for dieting.

The second reason why appetite increases when consuming a lot of salt is

This is because water is produced during the process of burning body fat.

I have consumed a lot of salt, which has increased the sodium in my body.

To adjust the concentration, it is necessary to increase body water.

When body fat is burned, water is produced in the process.

Burning body fat to obtain body water.

In order to restore the burned body fat, hunger arises.

For these two reasons, consuming a lot of salt increases appetite.

When appetite increases, dieting becomes difficult.

It is true that consuming a lot of salt is not good for dieting.

If eating a lot is the problem, then it should be reduced to a moderate level.

It doesn't mean that you have to eat a low-sodium diet to the point where the food is tasteless.

In the beginning of the video, it was mentioned that the human body tries to maintain a consistent sodium concentration.

So, when you consume a lot of salt, your body tries to increase water retention.

If you eat less salt, you are trying to reduce body fluid.

If you continue to eat less salt on a low-sodium diet,

Our body tries to maintain a state of reduced body water.

However, water is produced during the process of burning body fat.

Right now, I'm in a situation where I'm trying to minimize body fluid because I'm lacking sodium.

It would be problematic if water is generated in the body by using body fat as energy.

So, if you continue to follow a low-sodium diet, there will be a reaction that suppresses the use of body fat.

In short, it means that you won't lose weight.

In reality, if you have a low-sodium diet and become deficient in sodium, symptoms such as lethargy, fatigue, and weakness can occur.

If activity levels decrease due to these symptoms, the energy consumed by the body will also decrease.

When the energy consumed by the body decreases, it stops using body fat.

So, it means that there is no need to reduce the salt to the point where it becomes bland and tasteless.

Reducing salt like that can actually be bad for your diet.

The second reason diet food is tasteless is sugar.

To be precise, it tastes bland except for the seasoning that has a sweetness similar to sugar.

When we eat carbohydrates, those carbohydrates are converted into glucose in the body.

When the amount of glucose in the blood increases, blood sugar levels rise.

If blood sugar levels remain high, various health problems can arise.

When blood sugar levels rise, a hormone called insulin is released to lower that blood sugar.

Insulin lowers blood sugar levels, but it also increases body fat.

If blood sugar rises significantly and a lot of insulin is released,

Due to the large amount of insulin, body fat increases significantly, leading to obesity.

As this information became known,

To lose weight, you need to reduce your carbohydrate intake.

There is a growing awareness that seasonings with a sweet taste, like sugar, should never be consumed.

However, like salt, the problem lies in consuming too much of it.

So, as long as you don't eat too much, it's fine.

You should not eat even 1g of sugar. This is not the case.

They say that sugar should not be consumed at all because it quickly raises blood sugar levels.

Yes, there is such a story.

However, it is true that sugar raises blood sugar levels quickly.

The rapid increase in blood sugar and the significant elevation of blood sugar are two different matters.

For example, let's say we dissolve sugar in water to make sugar water.

Because sugar is in powder form, it dissolves very quickly when added to water.

However, no matter how quickly sugar dissolves in water,

If the amount of sugar added to the water is small, the water does not become sweet.

If you want to make the water much sweeter, you need to add a lot of sugar.

So how sweet does the water become?

The amount of sugar determines the height of this maximum sweetness.

How quickly do we reach the determined maximum sweetness?

What determines this speed is the rate at which sugar dissolves in water.

So, how much does blood sugar increase when you eat sugar?

The amount of sugar consumed determines the level of blood sugar.

If you don't consume a lot of sugar, the level to which your blood sugar can rise is lower.

It is just that the blood sugar quickly reaches that low level.

If the height at which blood sugar rises is low, then blood sugar does not increase significantly.

Therefore, insulin is not produced in large amounts.

So, as long as you don't consume too much sugar, eating sugar isn't a problem.

However, to taste the sweetness, you would still need to add quite a bit of sugar.

What will happen if it raises my blood sugar too much and becomes a problem?

If you are on a diet, you naturally end up eating a lot of vegetables.

This vegetable helps prevent an increase in blood sugar levels.

If you follow a proper diet, the sugar you add for flavor is not a problem.

There is an experiment that confirms how much the rise in blood sugar is suppressed when vegetables are actually consumed.

Among Korean ramen, there is a type called Bibimmyeon, which is mixed with a sweet and sour sauce.

Ramen itself is made of carbohydrates, and since it also includes a sweet and tangy seasoning sauce,

Eating bibim-myeon significantly raises blood sugar levels.

If we observe the blood sugar changes two hours after a meal, it rises to 185.

However, if you eat this bibim-myeon with 200g of vegetables, your blood sugar will not exceed 140.

Even when eating ramen with a sweet and sour sauce, the rise in blood sugar is suppressed to this extent.

It can't be said that the sugar added to enhance the flavor of food is the problem.

However, I really love sweet foods, so I feel like I need to add a lot of sugar to be satisfied.

What should someone like me do?

If you are someone who likes sweet foods, you probably eat a lot of snacks, chocolate, and cake regularly.

First of all, we need to reduce the intake of such foods.

A person's sense of taste becomes dull and it becomes difficult to perceive flavors when exposed to strong stimuli.

On the contrary, if you are not exposed to strong stimuli, you become more sensitive and it becomes easier to taste.

If you eat foods that are extremely high in sugar, like snacks, chocolate, and cake,

It provides a very strong stimulus to the sense of taste.

In this way, the sense of taste becomes dull, making it difficult to perceive sweetness.

Even when I eat sweet foods, I can't really taste the sweetness well.

You get caught in a vicious cycle of seeking sweeter foods.

However, if you reduce your intake of snacks, chocolate, and cake,

As your sense of taste becomes more sensitive, it becomes easier to perceive sweetness.

In this way, even a small amount of sugar can be felt as sweet enough.

Just because I like sweet foods doesn't mean I have to eat a lot of sugar.

It means that by sharpening my sense of taste, I can make it sweet enough for me to feel.

However, if your taste changes like that,

After the diet is over, if you eat the snacks, chocolate, and cake that you used to eat,

Wouldn't it feel too sweet?

Yes, that's right.

If you look at the comments on my video, you'll see that it used to be a snack that I enjoyed eating.

After dieting with the long-term diet plan, I ate something for the first time in a while.

It's too sweet, so it's hard to eat a lot of it.

There are quite a few comments mentioning that they feel dizzy or have headaches due to it being too sweet.

When this phenomenon occurs, the way we eat snacks, chocolates, and cakes changes.

If you change the way you eat, you may not gain weight even if you eat snacks, chocolate, and cake.

The third reason diet food is tasteless is calories.

Many people believe that reducing calorie intake is necessary for dieting.

So when it comes to a diet plan, people tend to think that they must lower their calorie intake without exception.

What is important in dieting is not the calories, but the type of food you eat.

Let's take another look at the bibim-myeon experiment we discussed earlier.

When eating only bibim-myeon and when eating bibim-myeon with vegetables.

Which of these two has a higher calorie count?

It is vegetable bibim-myeon.

The calories from the vegetables are added to the calories of the bibim noodles, so the actual calorie count is higher.

If that's the case, does that mean that vegetable bibim noodles are more fattening than regular bibim noodles because they have higher calories?

Of course, that's not the case.

Vegetable bibim-myeon does not significantly raise blood sugar levels, so a lot of insulin hormone is not released.

Because insulin hormone is not produced in large amounts, body fat does not increase significantly.

On the other hand, in the case of eating only bibim-myeon without vegetables,

Blood sugar has risen significantly, leading to a high release of insulin hormones.

Because a lot of insulin hormone is released, body fat increases significantly, leading to weight gain.

So, calories are not what matters.

What kind of food did you eat? That's important.

You can lose weight sufficiently without restricting calories if you eat the right foods.

I will summarize.

Foods to eat for dieting are

There is a perception that one should eat low-calorie without salt and sugar.

If you prepare food with this mindset, it will taste very bland.

So it's understandable to think that it's better to just starve and lose weight than to eat food like that.

However, there is no need to eat like that in the first place.

If you change the types of food you eat,

You can season with salt and sugar, and you can still diet without restricting calories.

You are suggesting that I change the types of food I keep eating, but how should I change them?

You can eat unrefined foods compared to the foods you were previously consuming.

In a moment, two videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to have a video explaining unrefined foods on the left.

If you are curious about what unrefined food is, you can click here to find out.

Earlier, when we were talking about sugar, you mentioned that eating a lot of sweet foods can make you feel dizzy.

I don't experience that phenomenon at all. Why is that?

It is a phenomenon that occurs because insulin resistance improves.

This question came up not long ago, so I made a related video.

I will make sure to have related videos on the right, so if you're curious, you can click and watch them.
