When will humanity evolve to the point where dieting is no longer necessary? - Evolution Part 1

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

The topic of this video is evolution.

When talking about dieting, there are times when we discuss the history of humanity.

In the past, humanity struggled to find food, and

So, storing food as body fat and using it sparingly was advantageous for survival.

It has evolved to have such characteristics.

In modern society, it is said that these characteristics are actually leading to obesity issues.

It's not just about the total amount of food, but there's also talk about carbohydrates.

In the past, humanity obtained carbohydrates from vegetables and fruits gathered through foraging.

There is a limit to the amount of vegetables and fruits that can be obtained through foraging.

Since vegetables and fruits themselves do not have a high carbohydrate content,

The carbohydrates consumed by ancient humans were very small in quantity.

So, it has evolved to survive on a low carbohydrate diet.

With the advent of agriculture and the cultivation of grains, people began to consume a large amount of carbohydrates for the first time.

It means that the body is unable to adapt to too many carbohydrates, resulting in the side effect of obesity.

Because of this, it is said that you need to reduce carbohydrates in order to diet.

However, after hearing this story, an interesting question appeared in the comments.

It is said that the history of agriculture has been over 10,000 years.

When will we finally adapt and evolve?

So how much more time do we need?

The question is whether it is possible to eat a lot of food and a lot of carbohydrates without gaining weight.

That's quite an interesting question, isn't it?

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

There are two main perspectives on evolution.

The first perspective is that organisms will change according to their natural environment.

The second is without any change to the entity.

It is the perspective that certain individuals are selectively preserved by nature.

It's difficult to explain, but let me give you an example to make it easier to understand.

When talking about evolution, the most commonly cited example is the giraffe.

The giraffe's diet consists of acacia leaves.

One day, as the Earth's climate changed, the number of acacia leaves became scarce.

In order for giraffes to survive, they must eat things that they normally cannot.

A situation has arisen where I need to eat the acacia leaves that are high up.

So, the giraffe tries to stretch its neck as long as possible to eat the acacia leaves high up.

As a result of that effort, the giraffe's neck became longer, and this was passed on to the next generation.

So, if you use a certain institution, that institution will develop.

The characteristics of such developed organs evolve as they are passed down to future generations.

This is called the theory of the use and disuse of organs.

Individuals change in order to adapt to the natural environment.

However, there is a major flaw in this argument.

The changes I created through my efforts do not carry on to future generations.

For example, a person who has injured their eyes in an accident will experience a decrease in vision and an increase in hearing ability.

As vision declines, the reliance on hearing has increased.

If such a person gets married and has children,

Is the child visually impaired from birth and have strong hearing?

Of course, that's not the case.

You are born with average vision and hearing.

A person who has worked hard to build muscle through exercise is similar to someone who has studied diligently to become smarter.

Even if the previous generation achieves some accomplishments through their efforts,

That achievement does not continue unchanged to future generations.

In order for a specific trait to be passed from the previous generation to the next, it must be inherited.

What is gained through acquired effort is not inherited.

Similarly, the giraffe made an effort to eat the acacia leaves that were high up.

Even if the result of that effort is a longer neck,

The characteristic of the elongated neck does not carry on to future generations.

So, why did the giraffe's neck become long?

From the moment of birth, there was a deformed giraffe that was born with a long neck.

It is because that giraffe survived.

The bodies of all living beings, including humans, are made up of countless cells.

This cell can undergo mutations during the division process.

This mutation can lead to the birth of a deformed giraffe with an unusually long neck.

This giraffe did not increase the length of its neck through acquired effort.

From the moment of birth, I have the genetic trait of having a long neck.

The offspring of this giraffe may inherit the trait of having a long neck.

Simply put, if the parents are tall, there is a higher probability that the children will also be tall due to genetics.

The offspring of a giraffe with a long neck have a higher probability of inheriting a long neck due to genetics.

The long-necked giraffe monopolized the acacia leaves that were high up.

As a result, it was very advantageous for survival and reproduction.

On the other hand, a giraffe with a short neck has a hard time finding food right away.

Reproduction was out of the question; survival was difficult as well.

If time passes in this state,

The long-necked giraffes are gradually increasing in number.

The population of giraffes with short necks is gradually decreasing.

At some point, the short-necked giraffes will become extinct, leaving only the long-necked giraffes.

This is evolution.

So, it's not that an individual changes its body through effort to adapt to the natural environment.

The idea is that evolution is essentially about selectively allowing only those individuals that are suited to the natural environment to survive from the beginning.

This is called the theory of natural selection.

Let's apply the theory of natural selection to humans.

The environment of humanity in the past was one where it was difficult to find food.

The characteristic of being able to store some of the food consumed in such an environment as body fat is

It was significantly advantageous for reproduction and survival.

Some of the food you eat can be stored as body fat.

It is possible to survive for a long time even with relatively little food.

You can survive for a long time even with a small amount of food.

It was also possible to share some of the food you had gathered.

Sharing food in an environment where food is scarce is very advantageous for reproduction.

On the other hand, individuals who cannot store food as body fat are

Because it cannot store body fat, it needs to eat food every time.

Therefore, it was only possible to survive by eating a relatively large amount of food.

I couldn't share food because I have a lot of food that I need to eat.

Therefore, individuals that do not easily gain body fat were at a disadvantage in both survival and reproduction.

As time passes in this situation,

According to natural selection, individuals that can store body fat become the overwhelming majority, leading to evolution.

Let's remember what we've discussed so far and return to the question that was posed at the beginning of the video.

With the development of agriculture, food has become abundant, and it has been quite some time since many carbohydrates have been consumed.

Is it possible to evolve into a body type that doesn't gain weight in such an environment?

Unfortunately, that is difficult to achieve.

Why isn't it working?

Obesity is the root of many diseases.

There are many diseases caused by obesity, and the mortality rate is also high.

Then, obesity is disadvantageous for survival.

People who are obese find it difficult to date and get married, which is also a disadvantage for reproduction.

Yes, that's right.

In today's society, where food is abundant,

The ability to store body fat is clearly disadvantageous for survival and reproduction.

As long as natural selection is applied, the number of individuals capable of storing body fat will decrease.

Given enough time, humanity will be able to evolve.

However, natural selection no longer applies to us now.

It is difficult for evolution to occur because natural selection does not apply.

In the next video, we will discuss why natural selection does not apply to us.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the Evolution Part 2 video,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
