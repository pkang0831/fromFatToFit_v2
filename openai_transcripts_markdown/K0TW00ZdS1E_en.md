The topic of this video is about fruits and blood sugar.

Those who have watched my videos a lot will know, but

I believe that blood sugar is the most important factor in fat loss.

I want to diet. If you don't want to become obese.

It is often said that it is better to avoid carbohydrates that quickly raise blood sugar levels.

If you consume carbohydrates that quickly raise blood sugar levels,

Insulin is secreted to lower blood sugar levels.

Insulin converts glucose in the blood into fat for storage.

If this process is repeated frequently, body fat accumulates, leading to obesity.

So it's not that you shouldn't eat carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates are essential nutrients for the body, so you should eat them.

I avoid consuming grains and carbohydrates that quickly raise blood sugar levels.

It is advisable to consume carbohydrates that slightly increase or gradually raise blood sugar, such as fruits and vegetables.

However, these two types are low in calories, so

If you only eat this, you will lack calories or other nutrients like fats and proteins.

It is also good to eat meat.

I mentioned that eating this way naturally leads to a low-carb, high-fat diet.

However, after seeing this, someone left a comment.

I understand the overall content, but there is one thing I am curious about.

I understand that vegetables are carbohydrates that do not raise blood sugar quickly.

You mentioned that fruits are carbohydrates that raise blood sugar levels a lot, right?

So this person's point is that fruits contain fructose, and

If you search on the internet or listen to what doctors say on TV,

Fruits are sweet, so if you eat too much, it can lead to weight gain.

When you actually eat the fruit, it is very sweet.

There is a table called the GI index that shows how much blood sugar increases after eating certain foods.

If it exceeds 70 here, it is considered a food that significantly increases blood sugar levels.

The fruit does not exceed 70, but most are exactly 70 or precariously high at around 67 to 68.

The important point here is that most of the organizations that provide the GI index are foreign institutions.

Therefore, the experiment is conducted based on foreign fruits.

Korean fruits are a bit sweeter than foreign fruits.

If we measure with Korean fruits, it will exceed 70.

In this case, aren't fruits carbohydrates that significantly increase blood sugar?

Someone left a comment asking, "What do you think about this?"

That's a very valid question, and I was surprised as well. This is a video summarizing my thoughts on that.

Are domestic fruits more expensive than foreign fruits? Let's start with this.

In fact, domestic fruits are said to be sweeter than foreign fruits.

A typical example is strawberries.

Domestic strawberries have a very high sugar content, don't they?

Some people sprinkle sugar on strawberries.

Even if you don't go out of your way to do that, just eating strawberries is already delicious enough.

It's common to buy strawberries, remove the stems, wash them, and then just eat them.

In comparison, it is said that American strawberries have a stronger sour taste than sweetness.

So it's rare to eat strawberries alone.

I heard that people often eat strawberries by drizzling sweet sauce on them or pairing them with other foods.

And I saw a foreigner posting about strawberries on social media.

Strawberries seem like vegetables disguised as fruits. You mentioned that they lack sweetness.

From a Korean perspective, it's hard to understand. The strawberries we eat are very different.

In addition to this, if you watch videos of foreigners reacting to domestic fruits on YouTube,

People often say that the fruit is very sweet compared to local fruit, with a lot of juice and high sugar content.

Just looking at this, it's a reasonable thought that domestic fruits are sweeter compared to foreign fruits.

It is only natural to say that the higher sweetness will result in a higher GI index.

In fact, most of the GI indices we encounter are based on foreign fruits and published by foreign institutions.

Then, if domestic institutions calculate the GI index using domestically produced fruits,

There is also a possibility that the blood sugar could quickly rise above the threshold of 70.

This is why fruits are foods that quickly increase blood sugar levels.

So, does that mean that foods that make you gain weight should not be eaten for dieting? Not necessarily.

You might think that it's different from what I mentioned earlier, but the reason is that...

The video where I first brought up the GI index is titled "Natural Plant-Based Diet and Low-Carb High-Fat Diet."

In this video, they talk about the GI index and mention that there are errors in the GI index.

This is a situation that corresponds to an error.

To talk about the error in the GI index,

We need to start discussing why the GI index was calculated and how it was determined.

What we call carbohydrates,

I thought that the carbohydrates in rice and the carbohydrates in cabbage would be different from each other.

In reality, rice and cabbage are different because the process of metabolism in the body is different for each.

So, after eating each of these two items, measure your blood sugar 30 minutes later.

There was a discussion about comparing how much blood sugar has increased.

After eating 100g of rice and 100g of cabbage and comparing them, there is one problem.

In the case of rice, there are 24g of carbohydrates in 100g.

In the case of cabbage, it contains 6g of carbohydrates per 100g.

So if both eat 100g each,

It becomes a situation where we compare 24g of carbohydrates in rice with 6g of carbohydrates in cabbage.

In this case, it's obvious that the rice side would be higher, right?

This one is 24g and this one is 6g, so there's almost a 4 times difference in quantity.

So, comparing like this is not a proper comparison.

The carbohydrate content inside must be the same.

So if you eat 100g of rice, you would need to eat 400g of cabbage to make a comparison.

If you eat 400g of cabbage, the carbohydrate content of the cabbage will be 24g.

In this case, it becomes a 1:1 comparison with rice.

By making a 1:1 comparison, we can see the unique carbohydrates that each food contains.

The GI index compares how much it raises blood sugar levels.

So the experiment itself is correct.

Since we need to compare them one-on-one, the conditions must be the same.

The experiment is being conducted correctly, and the GI index has come out properly.

As I try to reflect this in reality, errors start to occur.

A typical error is the confusion between sweet potatoes and carrots.

What kind of error is it?

In the case of sweet potatoes, it varies a bit depending on the cooking method.

The glycemic index (GI) of sweet potatoes is 60.

It is a food with a relatively low GI index, and that's why it is referred to as a source of quality carbohydrates.

Many people eat sweet potatoes when they are on a diet. They are often featured on TV and discussed a lot on the internet.

In the case of carrots, the GI index is reported to be 80.

It's really high. A GI index above 70 is considered high, and 80 is a very high number.

But let's think about it: is carrot a food that makes you gain weight?

There seems to be some kind of error here, logically speaking.

Huh? I don't think that's the case...

The reason why this difference occurs is that...

It's because the carbohydrate content in the food hasn't been taken into account.

When comparing the increase in blood sugar levels after consuming 100g of sweet potato and 100g of carrot,

In 100g of sweet potato, there are 20g of carbohydrates.

It means there are 20g of carbohydrates with a GI index of 60.

When you eat 100g of sweet potato, your blood sugar increases by 1200.

It's not that there is an exact formula like this, but rather that conceptually, you can calculate it this way.

Carrots contain 10g of carbohydrates per 100g.

If you eat 100g of carrots,

Since you are consuming 10g of carbohydrates with a GI index of 80,

In reality, the increasing blood sugar level is 800.

The GI index is in the 60s for carrots, which is much higher than 80.

In reality, the increased blood sugar levels are 1200 compared to 800, resulting in a situation where the carrot is lower.

So just because the GI index is high, it doesn't mean you'll gain weight.

Just because a food has a low GI (glycemic index) doesn't mean it won't make you gain weight. This is where the misunderstanding begins.

Let's consider the unique carbohydrate content found in food.

The GL index is a measure that was developed considering the GI index.

The GL index is calculated using the method proposed by Harvard University in 1997 as "(GI index x carbohydrate content) / 100." Foods with a GL (Glycemic Load) of 10 or below are classified as low, while those with a GL of 30 or above are classified as high.

And according to the GL index, fruits are included as foods that increase blood sugar levels moderately.

I'm not sure which sweet fruits you might think of.

In my case, I consider watermelon and strawberries to be sweet fruits.

In the case of this fruit, the carbohydrate content is only 8g per 100g. That's even lower than carrots.

Then, if the carbohydrates contained are only this much, why do they taste so sweet in our mouths?

In this case, it's because the flavors are not balanced.

When you add a sweet sauce to spicy food, you might experience that the spiciness feels less intense.

It's not that the taste has disappeared.

The spiciness and sweetness balance each other out, so we don't perceive them in our mouths.

Conversely, it means that without anything to balance it out, the flavor is felt more intensely.

So when you pour a cup of plain water and add just a little bit of sugar, it feels quite sweet.

In the case of fruits, about 80-90% of them are made up of water.

So when we ate fruit

The part where we perceive taste is a small amount of carbohydrates that taste sweet.

The rest is moisture that doesn't have a taste, which is why it feels sweeter.

In reality, fruits do not significantly raise blood sugar levels.

Based on the information so far, eating fruit does not cause a significant increase in blood sugar levels.

It is difficult to see it as food that increases body fat because of that.

Sounds plausible, right?
