A question has been posted in the comments asking about maintaining weight after dieting.

I am a subscriber who came across pkang while starting my diet.

The diet is going well, and I think this is good enough.

How do you stop dieting?

Are you going back to your old diet? But if you do, I feel like you might gain weight again...

Or should I reduce my exercise while maintaining my diet?

Please tell me how to maintain it.

I don't know how to stop dieting.

The reason this question arises is due to a misunderstanding of the effects of diet and exercise.

Many people believe that the effects of diet and exercise result in fat loss.

This is causing problems.

What people who have succeeded in dieting want is

It means maintaining the current state without increasing or decreasing body fat.

So after successfully dieting, I plan to stop my diet and exercise.

There is no longer a need to reduce body fat.

However, on the contrary, I feel that if I stop my diet and exercise, I will gain weight.

I want to maintain it.

If you follow a diet and exercise, you will lose weight, and if you don't follow a diet and exercise, you will gain weight.

You end up in a situation where you can't do this or that.

So I want to stop dieting and maintain my slim figure.

You start to think that you don't know what to do with this.

So, the effect of diet and exercise is misunderstood as a reduction in body fat.

Does that mean you don't know how to maintain it?

So, what is the effect of diet and exercise if it's not fat loss?

It is about creating an external environment.

In this world, there are people who are obese, but on the contrary, there are also people who are extremely underweight.

If a person with obesity is struggling because they have gained too much weight,

People who are too thin are struggling because they are too skinny.

A person who is obese needs to focus on diet and exercise to lose weight.

So, what should very thin people do to gain weight?

Gaining weight is simple!

You can eat a lot of things like chicken, pizza, and cola, and just lie down without moving.

There are really many people who talk like that.

The statement that I want to gain weight because I'm too thin.

I don't mean that I want to have a body like ET with just a protruding belly.

I want to gain weight overall on my very thin body to create a nice and slim figure.

So, the body that an obese person desires and the body that a very thin person desires are the same body.

So, for very thin people to gain weight overall, they need to focus on their diet and exercise.

If the effect of diet and exercise is a reduction in body fat,

Very thin people should not be on a diet or exercise, right?

Because body fat decreases, you become leaner.

However, in reality, it is not like that.

In reality, if a very thin person follows a diet and exercise regimen,

Overall, you will gain weight and have a more aesthetically pleasing body.

So, if an obese person follows a diet and exercises, they will lose weight and achieve a more aesthetically pleasing body.

If a person who is too thin follows a diet and exercises, they can gain weight and achieve a more aesthetically pleasing body.

The reason this happens is due to diet and exercise.

It's because an external environment has been created that leads to having a good-looking body.

The human body always has a response to maintain a constant state.

However, to maintain a certain state, it is necessary to change according to the environment.

For example, to maintain a constant body temperature,

In hot summer, you should wear thin clothes, and in cold winter, you should wear thick clothes.

So, in order to balance with the external environments of summer and winter, we need to change the clothes we wear.

If I start exercising with the same concept,

To maintain balance with exercise, my muscle mass increases.

If you reduce the energy intake with a low-calorie diet,

To balance the reduced energy, the basal metabolic rate decreases.

In the process of balancing like this, body fat may increase or decrease.

Once balance is achieved, there will be no further changes.

Isn't that a stagnation period?

Yes, that's right, a period of stagnation.

However, maintenance and stagnation are the same concept from the beginning.

After I succeed in my diet, if my body reaches a balance and there are no changes,

I have successfully lost weight and am maintaining it well. This is what I am saying.

I still need to lose a bit more weight, but if my body reaches a balance and there are no changes...

I need to diet more, but there hasn't been any change during this plateau. That's what I'm saying.

When you hit a plateau while dieting.

To overcome that plateau, it's said that you should change your diet and exercise.

The environment created by my diet and exercise, along with my body achieving balance, has led to a plateau.

By changing your diet and exercise, you can break through a plateau by disrupting the balance.

On the contrary, to prevent stagnation from being resolved,

You don't need to make any changes to the diet and exercise that are already in balance with my body.

However, if this happens, a person who has lost weight through diet and exercise will...

This means that in order to maintain that state, one must follow a diet and exercise regimen for a lifetime.

So for those who don't want to eat a lifelong diet plan,

I plan to diet by exercising while eating what I normally eat, without following a specific diet.

If you balance your diet by only exercising without a meal plan,

I can maintain a state of dieting while eating exactly what I used to eat.

On the contrary, a person who dislikes exercising for a lifetime...

I plan to diet only through my diet without exercising.

If you balance your diet for weight loss without exercising,

You can maintain your weight loss even if you don't continue exercising.

However, you should not choose one from these two options.

And there's no need to worry too much about maintaining a lifelong diet and exercise routine.

I want to succeed in my diet and maintain a slim body, but...

I don't want to eat a lifelong diet plan. What should I do?

I want to succeed in my diet and maintain a slim body, but...

I don't want to exercise for my whole life. What should I do?

Such a question was posted in the comments, so I had already made a video answering it.

In a moment, two videos will appear on the screen.

On the left, I've set it up to show videos about lifelong diet plans.

On the right, I will make sure to display videos about lifelong exercise.

Watch both videos and change your concept of lifelong diet and exercise.

Then dieting shouldn't be too difficult.

Maintaining your success after dieting will also become easier.
