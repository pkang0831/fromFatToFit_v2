How to find the right portion size for weight loss that suits me.

Hello, this is pkang.

Those who have watched my videos a lot will know, but

The basic principle of the diet I am talking about is to reduce the intake of refined foods.

Processed refined foods create false hunger, leading to overeating.

It is important to reduce the intake of processed foods to eliminate false hunger.

So if you reduce the intake of refined foods and eat unrefined foods,

It is said to eat when you're hungry and not to eat when you're full.

I'm not sure how much food I should eat.

I eat until my stomach feels so full that it seems like it might burst. Is it okay to eat like this?

I see a lot of comments with questions like this.

In this video, I will talk about how to find the right portion size for myself.

The reasons for eating more food than necessary can be broadly categorized into three main types.

The first is processed food.

The second is eating too quickly.

The third issue is the problem of satiety.

First, I have talked in detail about the first refined food across several videos.

When consuming processed refined foods, a large amount of insulin is released.

Due to the large amount of insulin secreted, a false sense of hunger arises, leading to eating more food than necessary.

It was said that we should reduce the intake of processed foods.

I talked about this in detail in the video [How to Distinguish Between Foods That Make You Gain Weight and Foods That Help You Lose Weight].

If you are curious about the content, you can click the link in the upper right to watch the video.

The second is a very fast eating pace.

I talked about this in detail in a video I made recently.

After a person eats, it takes some time to feel full.

However, if you eat too quickly, you end up overeating before you feel full.

I also talked about the experiments that were actually conducted.

It is prepared in a buffet style where you can take as much food as you want.

One side plays fast music, and people are encouraged to eat in a crowded and noisy environment.

On the other side, slow music is playing, there are no people, and I made it so that meals are taken in a quiet environment.

People who ate in a noisy environment consumed their food quickly and ate an average of more than four plates of food.

People who ate in a quiet environment ate slowly and consumed an average of fewer than three plates.

So in reality, eating less than three plates of food is sufficient.

If you eat quickly, you end up consuming more than four plates of food before you even feel full.

However, there was a comment with this content on that video.

Isn't it because it's a buffet style where you can bring more food?

If you set a specific amount of food to eat and only eat that, the quantity you consume will be the same whether you eat quickly or slowly.

Is that correct?

If I prepare just enough food for my body and eat only that,

Whether you eat quickly or slowly, you can avoid overeating.

However, this is based on the situation of preparing the amount of food that suits my body.

If you prepare too much food, it can actually have the opposite effect.

The cause of obesity is overeating, which means consuming a lot of food.

There are other causes of overeating, but the primary cause of obesity is overeating itself.

So, a person who eats more food than necessary becomes obese.

People who have a habit of eating a lot of food tend to prepare a large amount when they are getting ready to cook.

There are two types of problems that arise here.

The first problem is that even when I'm full, I still try to eat all the food I've prepared.

If you're full, why are you eating everything?

Everyone has different reasons.

There are times when I feel that leaving food uneaten and throwing it away is not the right thing to do.

There are times when I feel it's a waste to throw away food.

There are times when people feel it's bothersome to deal with food waste that results from leftover food.

There can be cases where multiple reasons are combined.

So, because there is a certain amount that one used to eat,

I don't intentionally try to prepare a lot, but I tend to prepare a lot of food.

If the tendency to eat all the food prepared here combines,

Even without false hunger, there are cases where people overeat even when they eat slowly and feel full.

The second case is when people unknowingly overeat due to the speed at which they eat.

As mentioned at the beginning of the video,

It takes some time to feel full after eating.

If you eat food quickly, there are times when you overeat before feeling full.

If you set the correct portion size for food as mentioned in the question and eat only that amount, there shouldn't be any problems.

If you prepare more than the necessary amount,

When eating quickly, it can be hard to recognize that you are overeating.

But in reality, it's overeating.

So what should I do?

You can take a test to find out the amount of food you need.

On a holiday when you can stay home all day, try making and eating your own food.

The types of food consumed at this time should be unrefined foods.

You should prepare half the amount of food you usually eat.

Since it's half the amount I usually eat, it might seem like there's not enough.

Since it's a holiday where I will be resting at home all day anyway, I can just make more if I run out.

Even if it looks a bit insufficient, just prepare that amount and try eating it.

The amount of food prepared is small.

Even if you eat quickly, it doesn't lead to overeating.

I wouldn't overeat even if I say I'll finish all the food because I feel it's a waste to leave it behind.

If you eat even a small amount of food, your hunger will go away.

After the hunger goes away, it is important to know when you will feel hungry again.

If you ate unprocessed food and are hungry again after 2 or 3 hours,

It means that there was not enough food.

In this case, since there is not enough food, you can make more food to eat.

However, it seemed a bit lacking when eating, but if the feeling of fullness lasts for more than 5 to 6 hours, then...

This means that there was not a shortage of food.

So, the amount of food that seemed insufficient to me was actually the right amount for my body.

The amount of food I usually eat is too much, which means I didn't realize it.

I will summarize.

If you eat unprocessed foods, the false hunger disappears, and the desire to overeat does not arise.

Due to my usual habit of preparing a lot of food, I prepare a lot of food.

If I eat all the food without leaving any behind, there are times when I unknowingly end up overeating.

I am eating unrefined foods, but I think I am eating too much.

Or I feel bad because my stomach is too full after eating.

In such cases, a simple test can be conducted.

It would be good to check if you are unknowingly overeating.

In the next video, we will talk about the feeling of fullness that occurs depending on the type of food.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the next video, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making it.
