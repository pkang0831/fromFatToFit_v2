To lose weight? Eat small amounts frequently vs. Have fasting periods.

Hello, this is pkang.

An interesting question has come up in the comments.

These days, many people recommend intermittent fasting as a method for dieting.

It is said that there should be a fasting period during which food is not consumed.

I heard that skipping breakfast is good for dieting.

When I was young, I was told that in order to diet, I must eat breakfast.

I told you not to eat a lot at once, but to eat a little bit frequently.

If it's severe, eat six meals a day. There was also advice to eat regularly even if you're not hungry.

This is not just an internet story; it is something that a doctor said on a TV broadcast.

Why are you talking the opposite these days?

That's an interesting question, isn't it?

In this video, I will talk about this.

It's a story that has been mentioned a lot in other videos as well.

The reason we become obese is due to overeating.

And the cause of this overeating is due to processed refined foods.

I talked about how to distinguish between fattening foods and weight-loss foods in the video.

Processed refined foods trigger the secretion of large amounts of insulin.

Large amounts of insulin create a false sense of hunger, increasing appetite and leading to overeating.

To diet, it is important to reduce the intake of processed and refined foods.

We need to eliminate false hunger and normalize appetite.

In the past, this concept was not established.

There was no awareness that the desire to overeat was abnormal.

I thought that simply resisting the urge to overeat would lead to weight loss.

It was quite difficult and challenging because I had to endure without any specific reason.

So at that time, being hungry was considered very normal during dieting.

Dieting itself was seen as difficult, painful, and distressing.

So, people who succeeded in dieting were perceived as extremely strong-willed.

There were even sayings that one shouldn't associate with people who have succeeded in dieting and quitting smoking.

There is a saying that those who succeed in dieting can do anything.

The problem is that this diet method had a very low success rate, so I started looking for other methods.

The method that came out like that is a way to eat a little bit more frequently.

Basically, all living organisms prioritize survival in their responses.

Obesity is certainly not an advantageous form for survival.

So it is not designed to be inherently obese.

However, there is a desire to eat a lot of food to the point of becoming obese.

As a result, there is a perception that people who become obese have issues with appetite control.

A typical symptom that arises from problems with appetite control is binge eating disorder.

Simply eating a lot and becoming obese cannot be classified as binge eating disorder, but...

In terms of having issues with appetite control, it's similar.

So, by applying the methods used to treat binge eating disorder, a dieting method is developed.

One of the methods to treat binge eating disorder is to eat food before feeling hungry.

When you feel hungry without being able to control your appetite, you tend to binge eat too much food.

There is a tendency to force oneself to vomit due to the guilt of having overeaten.

This is why we eat food to prevent hunger before we even feel it in the first place.

I need to eat in advance so that I don't feel hungry.

I eat regularly at set times.

If we summarize the diet rules derived from this, it would look like this.

If you skip breakfast, you'll get very hungry and end up overeating at lunch, so make sure to eat breakfast.

If you're hungry, you'll tend to overeat, so eat before you get hungry.

Eat regularly even if you are not hungry.

It's similar to the diet rules that were mentioned at the beginning of the video, right?

So, do those rules have no effect on dieting?

No, that's not the case. Interestingly, it is effective.

If we summarize the process of becoming obese at that time,

I skip breakfast because I'm busy and start working after arriving at the office.

Because I didn't have breakfast, I get hungry while commuting and working.

When you work while suppressing your hunger, you tend to overeat at lunch as a form of reward psychology.

The problem is that the food eaten at lunch is processed and refined food.

Eating a lot of processed foods can lead to false hunger.

Even if you eat a sufficient amount of lunch, you will feel hungry again and want to eat after 3 to 4 hours.

I had lunch at 12, but I start wanting a snack around 3 to 4 in the afternoon.

Since snacks are processed foods, they can create false hunger.

So I had a snack, but I will have dinner in about 3 to 4 hours.

If you eat snacks and then have dinner, it leads to overeating.

If you resist eating snacks and endure hunger, you tend to overeat at dinner due to a reward psychology.

The story is that, one way or another, overeating happens.

I usually have dinner around 7 to 8 o'clock.

At this time, if you eat refined foods, you will experience false hunger again.

After 3 to 4 hours, around 11 to 12 o'clock, I start to feel hungry for food.

This is why I end up having a late-night snack.

If you eat refined foods for a late-night snack, it can lead to false hunger.

After having a late-night snack, I go to sleep, so I'm not hungry at the moment.

When I wake up in the morning and start moving around, I begin to feel hungry.

In the morning, it's hard to eat because I'm busy getting ready for work, so when I skip breakfast and head to the office...

The compensation mentality leads me to overeat lunch again.

This vicious cycle is why many people eat a lot and become obese.

Make sure to eat breakfast.

Don't eat a lot of food at once; eat small amounts frequently.

Following this rule for meals has the effect of reducing false hunger.

The reason for fake hunger arises when a large amount of nutrients enters the body in a short period of time.

This is because a large amount of insulin is secreted to process that nutrient.

The more processed foods you eat, the more nutrients enter your body.

So, false hunger appears more strongly.

If we say this in reverse,

Even if you eat processed foods, if you consume them in small amounts, relatively fewer nutrients will be ingested.

So it means that false hunger appears weakly.

[The reason my friend who keeps eating fattening snacks is slim] I talked about it in the video.

In the case of someone who eats snacks very quickly and always finishes a bag once it's opened,

Due to severe false hunger, I eat a lot of food and become obese.

When someone eats snacks very slowly and leaves some snacks uneaten,

It was mentioned that there are cases where people do not overeat due to weak false hunger, which prevents obesity.

When I have breakfast and go to work, I feel less hungry than when I skip breakfast.

So I eat processed food for lunch, but I eat a relatively small amount.

Since I ate a small amount of processed food, the fake hunger weakens.

A similar phenomenon occurs in the evening as well.

So, if you reduce the amount of processed food you eat at one time, the false hunger will weaken.

Thanks to this, eating a little bit more often has also helped with my diet.

In fact, there have been many cases where people succeeded in dieting using such methods.

Among the debates surrounding intermittent fasting, this aspect often becomes a point of contention.

In intermittent fasting, you need to have fasting periods.

Eating small amounts of food frequently can lead to weight gain. It is argued that one should eat in larger quantities at once.

Those who oppose intermittent fasting argue that

Until intermittent fasting became popular, it was essential to have breakfast if you wanted to lose weight.

If you endure hunger, you'll end up binge eating, so eating a little bit often is the key to dieting.

You're arguing that it doesn't make sense to change things suddenly now.

However, the truth is that it depends on the food you eat.

If the food you eat is processed food that creates false hunger,

When you eat a large amount all at once, the false hunger intensifies, leading to overeating.

It is actually more beneficial for dieting to eat small amounts frequently.

In the case of people who practice intermittent fasting while consuming refined foods,

Due to false hunger, my appetite has increased, making it difficult to stick to fasting times.

As a psychological reward for enduring hunger during fasting hours, one may binge eat during meal times.

That's where the term "intermittent binge eating" came from.

On the other hand, when practicing intermittent fasting while eating unrefined foods,

Because there is no false hunger, it is not difficult to stick to the fasting schedule.

Returning to the original story.

Eating small amounts frequently has certainly helped with dieting, but...

There was a problem that made it difficult to continue.

In fact, eating small amounts frequently can be quite bothersome and cumbersome.

Simply put, it's not easy to keep eating without skipping breakfast.

So, there were many people who gave up in the middle of their diet.

Many people have succeeded in dieting but ended up gaining weight back to their original state after having regular meals.

This led to the realization that the problem lies in trying to suppress the desire to overeat.

Is the desire to overeat normal in the first place? Why do we want to overeat?

This raises fundamental questions.

And finally, we reach the concept of refined and unrefined foods.

To summarize,

In the past, the concepts of refined and unrefined foods had not yet been established.

I didn't know why the desire to overeat arose.

So I mainly used methods to simply suppress those desires.

One of the methods was to eat small amounts of food frequently.

So in the past, the method of eating small amounts frequently was recommended as a way to diet.

These days, I know that the cause of the desire to overeat is refined foods.

There is a rule that you should not eat refined foods and should eat unrefined foods instead.

Even if you eat a lot of unprocessed foods, you won't experience false hunger.

There is no rule that says you have to eat little by little frequently.

I am eating unrefined foods as you advised, Ron.

I have a small appetite, so I can't eat a lot at once.

So I am eating in a way that involves having small amounts frequently.

Is eating like this not good for dieting?

No, that's not the case.

In the next video, we will discuss this question in detail.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the next episode, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
