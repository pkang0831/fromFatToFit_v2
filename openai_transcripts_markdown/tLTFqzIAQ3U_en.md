This is a video responding to questions about raw sugar and regular sugar that were posted in the comments.

You mentioned that refined sugar is bad, but is raw sugar okay? I'm thinking of using it a little while cooking...

To get straight to the point, you can use refined sugar in moderation for cooking.

You kept saying to reduce refined carbohydrates, but now you're saying it's okay to eat refined sugar?

The reason refined carbohydrates are problematic is that they have two characteristics.

The first characteristic is that it is quickly digested and absorbed.

Raising blood sugar quickly.

The second reason is that it has a high carbohydrate content.

It means that the peak of blood sugar rises high and is maintained for a long time.

Conversely, if either of the two characteristics is missing, it does not pose a problem.

For example, the fructose found in fruits has the characteristic of rapidly increasing blood sugar levels.

So, are fruits fattening foods?  
No, they are not.

Because the fructose in fruit quickly raises blood sugar levels, but

It's because the carbohydrate content in fruits is low.

I explained this topic in a video I made earlier titled "Are Fruits Fatty Foods?"

If you're curious about the content, there's a video link in the top right corner, so you can click it to watch the video.

The reason why the sugar in bread, snacks, and beverages is problematic is that

It's because the amount being put in is very large.

However, the amount of sugar I put in my cooking is something I can control.

If you adjust it so that you don't add too much, it won't be a problem.

What does a small amount refer to?

It refers to the amount that does not create false hunger.

So, I have a feeling of fullness because I ate a satisfying meal.

I'm feeling a bit bored and want to eat something.

Or, even after having a satisfying meal, hunger can return in just 3 to 4 hours.

If this phenomenon occurs, reduce the amount of sugar since it is too high.

If this phenomenon does not occur, it does not mean that there is a lot of sugar.

Is it true that raw sugar is healthier than refined sugar?

There are two main reasons why unrefined products are considered healthier than refined ones.

The first reason is that it is unrefined, so digestion and absorption are slower.

It means that the rate of increase in blood sugar is slow.

If we compare honey and sugar,

Because raw sugar is less refined than regular sugar.

It is true that the speed at which blood sugar rises is slow.

However, since raw sugar is made by extracting, filtering, and boiling sugarcane,

It has already been refined too much.

Compared to sugar, it is lower, but the rate of blood sugar increase from raw sugar is not slow.

So this difference doesn't have any significance.

And as I mentioned at the beginning of the video,

The small amount of sugar and raw sugar used in cooking does not significantly affect blood sugar levels.

Even though maltose raises blood sugar levels more slowly than sugar, it does not affect health.

The second point is that unrefined foods contain more vitamins and minerals.

This is also a valid point when you think about it.

Wondang contains vitamins and minerals that are not found in sugar.

However, the amount used in cooking is quite small.

A small amount of vitamins and minerals doesn't amount to much.

It is included, but in such a small amount that it does not significantly affect health.

And vitamins and minerals can be obtained from fruits and vegetables.

The claim that you need to eat sugar to obtain vitamins and minerals doesn't make sense.

To summarize,

It is said that brown sugar is healthier than white sugar.

They advertise it as being priced under 10,000 won, but...

You can think of it as a situation where the price of the item is 9,990 won.

It is true that 9,990 won is cheaper than 10,000 won.

However, the price difference is only 10 won, so it is not significant.

Upon closer examination, it is true that raw sugar is healthier than regular sugar.

However, the degree to which it is good for health is so small that it doesn't really have any significant meaning.

Using sugar in cooking is

If you use an amount that doesn't trigger false hunger, it won't be a problem.

Sounds plausible, right?
