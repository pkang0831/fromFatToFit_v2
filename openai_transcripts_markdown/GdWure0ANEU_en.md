Stress is not the root of all diseases - Part 3 on Stress

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video about stress.

In Part 1 of the video, we discussed the principle of how stress leads to obesity.

In the second part of the video, we talked about whether stress from exercise interferes with dieting.

In this video, we will discuss whether stress is the root cause of all diseases.

If you are curious about the content of the previous video,

Stress is the root of all ailments.

This is the most basic image that most people have about stress.

Many people think that it's better to avoid stress as much as possible.

In reality, it is not like that.

When talking about stress, the discussion always includes the fight-or-flight response.

I mentioned it in the first part of the video as well.

In the past, situations that caused stress for humanity were primarily life-threatening situations.

In that situation, it is a struggle to secure safety by defeating the enemy that poses a threat to life.

In a life-threatening situation, while quickly fleeing to secure safety.

I had to choose one thing.

So, temporarily, physical abilities increase to favor struggle and escape.

This is called the fight-or-flight response to stress.

But what would happen if there were no stress in a life-threatening situation?

If there is no stress, the fight-or-flight response does not occur.

If there is no fight or flight response, physical abilities do not increase.

In this case, it would actually put lives at risk.

So, without the negative image that stress is the root of all diseases,

If we focus solely on the phenomena that stress causes in the body,

It temporarily boosts physical abilities to help solve difficult problems.

The awakening effect of coffee can be seen as quite similar.

It seems like it would be helpful in a life-threatening situation.

In modern times, there aren't many situations where life is at risk, so isn't it better to have less stress?

That's not the case.

If you apply a strong load that is difficult for the muscles in my body to withstand,

This subordinate causes me to feel stressed.

Stress temporarily enhances physical abilities, helping to overcome burdens.

If you manage to overcome a load that is difficult to bear with your current muscles, with the help of stress, then...

As muscles grow and develop, this is what we call exercise.

The increase in abilities due to stress is not only applicable to muscles; it also has mental effects.

If you confine a rat to a small space and force it to experience stress,

There is a phenomenon where memory improves compared to rats that are not under stress.

The stress that the body experiences seems to help increase muscle mass.

This is because mental stress helps to increase the number of neurons in the memory storage.

In situations where a person is under stress, the hormone DHEA is released along with cortisol.

This hormone has the effect of enhancing concentration and cognitive ability.

There are statistics showing that students with higher levels of this hormone have higher grades than those who do not.

So stress temporarily enhances my abilities in crisis situations.

Play a role in helping to get out of a crisis situation.

It means that if you use stress to get out of a crisis situation, your physical abilities will increase.

So, does that mean it's good to be under a lot of stress?

In part 1 of the video, you mentioned that stress can lead to obesity, right?

Yes, that's right.

Moderate exercise develops muscles, but excessive exercise can lead to injuries.

Moderate stress can have positive effects, but excessive stress has negative effects.

The pain that does not kill me makes me stronger. However, excessive pain can indeed kill me.

I will briefly summarize what I talked about in Part 1 of the video.

In the past, situations that caused stress for humanity were primarily life-threatening situations.

So in stressful situations, energy is prepared to favor fight or flight.

Modern humans often experience stress in situations that are not related to life-threatening dangers.

Neither fighting nor escaping, and as a result, the energy that was prepared is left unused.

It was said that obesity is caused by energy being left unused like this.

However, there is one blind spot in this story.

The stress that humanity experienced in the past was

It's the stress of being in an extreme situation where if I can't kill the opponent or escape, I could die.

Indeed, the stress experienced in such situations

The question is whether the stress and intensity that modern humanity experiences in academics, work, and interpersonal relationships are the same.

Of course, that's not the case.

The stress of an extreme situation where one could die is obviously much stronger.

So the stress experienced by humanity in the past and the stress experienced by modern humanity.

Comparing on the same level has some errors.

Then a question arises here.

If the stress that modern humanity experiences is not as strong as that of past humanity,

Modern humanity should not become obese or experience a decline in health even when under stress.

In reality, it is very common to see people who become obese or have health issues due to stress.

So, there are other factors that strongly contribute to modern stress.

That element is a negative image of stress.

A person with a negative image of stress

Since stress is not good, I find myself thinking that I don't want to experience it.

The problem is that just because I don't want to receive it, doesn't mean I can avoid it.

So, I don't want to be stressed, but I find myself in situations that cause stress.

That situation becomes a source of stress again.

So I wasn't thinking about elephants.

When you hear the phrase "Don't think about the elephant,"

It's like being reminded of an elephant because of that story.

People who do not have a negative image of stress tend to just brush it off when they experience stress.

A person with a negative image of stress cannot simply brush it off when they are stressed.

The fact that I am stressed is causing me more stress.

So, a vicious cycle is occurring where stress leads to more stress.

This vicious cycle causes stress to build up and prolongs the exposure to stress.

Stress that is exposed for such a long time is called chronic stress.

This chronic stress can lead to obesity or cause health problems.

Does it make sense that having a negative image of stress leads to different effects?

It is actually possible.

If you deceive a patient into believing that a completely ineffective drug has an effect and make them take it,

There are cases where the bodies of patients who truly believe in that medicine recover.

This is called the placebo effect.

There are similar experiments regarding stress as well.

Dividing people into two groups.

One group is shown videos with positive content about stress.

Another group was shown videos with negative content about stress.

If both groups are exposed to a stressful situation,

The group that watched positive videos about stress showed active secretion of cortisol and DHEA hormones.

The group that watched negative videos about stress showed a decrease in the secretion of the DHEA hormone.

So, the group that has a positive image of stress is

I have experienced the positive effects of stress.

The group with a negative image of stress could not do so.

I will summarize.

The negative image of stress prevents the positive effects of stress.

Stress leads to a vicious cycle that causes more stress, resulting in chronic stress.

This chronic stress has a significant negative impact on health.

On the contrary, if you let go of the negative image of stress,

You can break the vicious cycle and prevent chronic stress.

When muscles are stressed from exercise, they develop.

When you study and your brain experiences stress, you can also gain positive effects that contribute to brain development.

So, stress is not the root of all diseases.

The negative image that stress is the root of all diseases is, in fact, the root of all diseases.
