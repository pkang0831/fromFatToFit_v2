What to Do the Next Day After Drinking While on a Diet - Alcohol and Diet Part 4

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the fourth video about alcohol and dieting.

In Part 1 of the video, the reasons why alcohol is not good for dieting are discussed.

In the second part of the video, we will discuss an experiment that shows if you maintain the same calorie intake, you can lose weight even if you drink alcohol.

In part 3 of the video, we discussed whether it's realistically possible to diet while drinking alcohol.

In this video, I will talk about what you should do the day after drinking.

Since the content continues from the first part of the video, it is better to watch them in order.

For those who haven't watched Part 1 of the video, the link is available in the top right corner.

In the third part of the video, I talked about how to diet while drinking alcohol.

This method is effective, but it is almost impossible to put into practice.

You said it was a method that is only theoretically possible.

In fact, as long as you go out for drinks, there is no way to diet.

So if you went out for drinks, I said to put the diet aside for a moment and enjoy yourself.

However, there is one rule that must be absolutely followed.

It means that you shouldn't drink excessively beyond your capacity.

There are two main reasons why you should avoid excessive drinking.

The first reason is to prevent overeating during meals.

As mentioned in the second part of the video, alcohol has the characteristic of lowering self-control.

When heavily intoxicated, one may lose self-control and binge on snacks.

In reality, there is a celebrity who, when completely drunk, has a habit of not saying anything and just keeps eating food.

The next day, I woke up and had no memory, as I mentioned on the broadcast.

If you go out for drinks, the advice to put your diet on hold and eat comfortably means...

Insisting on low-calorie snacks while drinking with others, even if it causes discomfort.

I want to eat snacks, but I'm forcing myself to hold back. It's saying not to stress out and to eat moderately.

That doesn't mean you can binge on snacks.

The second reason is a hangover.

If you drink a lot, the hangover the next day can be really strong.

When the hangover is too severe, you don't want to move and feel too lazy to do anything.

However, how you behave the day after drinking is very important.

If the hangover is too severe, it’s not good.

What should I do the day after drinking?

First, please drink more water than usual. You need to drink at least 2 liters or more.

Alcohol dehydrates the body, which causes a feeling of thirst.

People can obtain moisture not only from water but also from food.

There are quite a few cases where thirst is mistaken for hunger.

Please help me drink more water than usual so that I don't mistake thirst for hunger.

The next thing to do is exercise.

The purpose of exercise is to raise the metabolism that has decreased due to alcohol.

You don't have to do very intense exercise; just enough to break a light sweat is sufficient.

Lastly, please avoid eating processed foods and have your meals with unprocessed foods.

Since I had snacks at the drinking party yesterday, wouldn't it be better to skip eating and just fast?

No, that's not the case.

As mentioned in the previous video, alcohol is fundamentally recognized as a toxin by the body.

From the body's perspective, it was attacked by poison yesterday and is currently in the process of recovering from that damage.

In order to recover, it's important to have a variety of nutrients beyond just carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

In this situation, intentionally not eating food does not help with recovery.

Moreover, the day after drinking, the feeling of hunger is extremely intense.

There are cases where people force themselves to hold back, and then end up overeating when they finally give in.

Of course, I don't want to eat it, but there's no need to force myself to eat.

Please do not intentionally starve yourself, and if you need to eat, please choose unrefined foods.

I cannot go my whole life without drinking alcohol.

Due to social life and interpersonal relationships, I cannot avoid going to drinking gatherings.

Because there are people drinking together, I can't choose the alcohol and snacks according to my own preferences.

That's all true.

However, when it comes to drinking at that gathering, I have the choice of whether to overindulge or not.

This is something that can't be helped.

The next day, I lay in bed all day because of a hangover.

The metabolic rate remains consistently low.

Due to thirst and hunger caused by alcohol, I eat refined foods under the pretext of a hangover cure.

Giving up on dieting due to feelings of self-loathing and stress is the worst.

If it's an unavoidable drinking occasion, drink according to your tolerance so you don't have a hangover.

Please end the drinking session on that day.

The next day, you should recover your body as quickly as possible and return to your normal routine.
