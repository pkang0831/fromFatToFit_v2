The reason why people continue to lose weight by starving themselves even though they know the yo-yo effect is coming. Basic Metabolism Part 3.

Hello, this is pkang.

This is the third video about basal metabolic rate.

In the first part of the video, we discussed research indicating that even when following a starvation diet, the basal metabolic rate does not decrease.

In the second part of the video, we discussed the claim that even with a starvation diet, muscle loss does not occur.

If you have watched parts 1 and 2 of the video,

You probably understand that starving diets or low-calorie diets are not good.

However, despite the fact that there is a lot of information out there saying that losing weight by starving is not good,

Why do people who starve themselves to lose weight continue to exist?

In this video, I would like to talk about these kinds of people.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it is recommended to watch the previous video in order.

If you haven't seen the previous video, you can click the link in the top right to watch it.

The reason why some people continue to starve themselves to lose weight, even though it is said to be unhealthy, is

When you first start, the effects are quite noticeable and it's not that difficult.

You say it's not hard to starve? It's really tough to starve.

This is the case if you have repeatedly gone without food or have fasted for a long time.

When starting a fasting diet or a low-calorie diet for the first time, it is not as difficult as you might think.

There is a video I made in the past titled [The Reasons You Find Dieting Difficult].

In that video, it was mentioned that a person with a high body fat percentage has a response in their body that tries to reduce body fat on its own.

So in the early stages of a diet with a lot of body fat, body fat tends to decrease quickly.

When body fat decreases and approaches a normal weight, it becomes harder for body fat to decrease further.

In the first part of the video on basal metabolic rate, if the energy obtained from food decreases due to starvation,

To prevent a decrease in basal metabolic rate, it was mentioned that the activity metabolic rate and exercise metabolic rate would instead decrease.

If we connect these two ideas,

The basal metabolic rate and exercise metabolic rate have decreased, resulting in a reduction of the energy needed by the body.

This means that body fat is being reduced effectively, and energy is being supplied from there.

In this case, there is not as much of a lack of energy as I thought.

So it's possible to maintain your basal metabolic rate even if you don't eat.

Because of this, my appetite for food is not very strong.

In fact, among the reviews of intermittent fasting,

I thought that fasting for 16 hours would be difficult, but surprisingly, it wasn't hard at all.

There are reports that appetite has actually been regulated, making fasting easier.

In addition to reviews of intermittent fasting, there are also reviews of regular fasting.

At first, I thought a lot about food, but after a few days, many people report that those thoughts disappeared.

However, among the reviews from people who are trying intermittent fasting for the first time,

There are people who say they can't keep the fasting hours because they're hungry.

They say that during the initial stages of fasting, thoughts about food come up frequently. Why is that?

It is due to fake hunger caused by processed foods.

This is something I've mentioned multiple times in other videos.

Processed refined foods have the issue of causing a large secretion of insulin.

The large amount of insulin secreted creates a problem of false hunger, even though food is not needed.

If you eat food based on this false hunger,

It's because they are eating even though they don't need food, which is why they are gradually becoming obese.

For those who consume processed foods, there is a craving due to false hunger.

In the early stages of fasting, food is not necessary, but the appetite is very strong.

When time passes and the false hunger disappears, that phenomenon goes away.

For those who find it difficult to stick to fasting hours while practicing intermittent fasting,

During the 8 hours of eating after a 16-hour fast, most people consume refined foods.

If you eat processed foods and experience false hunger,

It's the fake hunger that makes the 16-hour fast difficult.

Intermittent fasting often just requires you to stick to a 16-hour fast.

There are people who think that it's okay to eat freely.

Eating refined foods makes it difficult to maintain a 16-hour fast.

You need to pay attention to the food you eat.

In fact, many people who practice intermittent fasting also follow a low-carb, high-fat diet.

There is information that suggests the need to prevent excessive insulin secretion even in a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Following a low-carb, high-fat diet makes it easier to stick to fasting periods.

Returning to the original story.

So for someone who is starting a fasting diet for the first time, it feels like...

Aside from feeling a bit weak and not wanting to exercise, I don't really notice any significant drawbacks.

It's not that the basal metabolic rate decreases, and body fat is reducing well, so it's not as difficult as I thought.

This is the reason why more and more people are starting starvation diets.

If it were difficult, hard, and felt like there were side effects from the very beginning, no one would attempt it.

At first, it's not difficult, and there are no side effects, so many people do it because they see good weight loss results.

And people who have lost weight often think that starving themselves or eating less is the way to go.

I think it's the best diet.

People who see this find it hard to understand those who study dieting and plan their meals.

You can easily lose weight just by skipping meals and eating less.

Because I'm doing strange things without being hungry.

However,

Wait a minute! Are you trying to say that if you starve for a long time, your basal metabolic rate will eventually decrease?

So if you don't do it for a long time, isn't it okay? You said there are no side effects if it's done briefly, right?

Yes, that's right.

The eating method that comes from that concept is intermittent fasting, which involves short fasting periods.

However, there is one condition here.

The recovery process mentioned in Part 2 of the basal metabolic rate video must be included.

In the past, humanity often faced situations of hunger because it was difficult to find food.

When you are starving, the body's response is to lower the active metabolic rate and exercise metabolic rate in order to protect the basal metabolic rate.

However, after that, I engage in an activity that uses a lot of muscles, which is hunting.

After the hunt, they consumed the prey to take in a large amount of nutrients.

Through this process, I have restored my total daily energy expenditure and exercise energy expenditure.

However, modern humanity can obtain food without hunting, so

There is a problem that the metabolic rate does not recover unless you exercise separately.

The energy we consume in a day is

It is determined by the sum of the basal metabolic rate, activity metabolic rate, and exercise metabolic rate.

The fact that the basal metabolic rate and exercise metabolic rate decrease and do not recover means that

It means that the total amount of energy I consume in a day has decreased.

So before I started the starvation diet, I was burning 100 calories a day.

Even though I ate food worth 100, I didn't gain any weight.

After doing a starvation diet, the total amount of energy I expend in a day has decreased.

Eating 1 million worth of food will make you gain weight. It means your body becomes prone to gaining weight.

To prevent this, engage in exercises that use a lot of muscles, like hunting.

After finishing exercise, you need to have a sufficient meal to restore your metabolism.

In intermittent fasting, while the fasting period is important, the eating period is also significant, and this is the reason for that.

If you are practicing intermittent fasting but are not eating properly during meal times,

If your body feels weak and you don't want to move, and if you're not exercising,

I am on a starvation diet or a low-calorie diet.

It is a situation where it is mistaken for intermittent fasting.

I often see comments like, "I've been doing intermittent fasting for 16 hours, but my weight isn't decreasing well."

"Is it okay to extend the fasting period to 18 hours?" "Should I do a 23-hour fast?" These questions are being raised.

Thinking that you will fast longer because you are not losing weight is not the mindset of intermittent fasting.

This is the mindset of a starvation diet.

If you are not trying to lose weight by starving yourself, you need to pay attention to your meal times as much as your fasting times.

However, if you lose weight by starving yourself and then start eating again, you gain weight, right?

Yes, that's right. That part is the point.

Many of the people who are trying to lose weight by starving themselves

When you lose weight from starving, you think that body fat has decreased.

Body fat does not decrease quickly or increase quickly.

The reason we become obese is due to poor eating habits and lifestyle choices.

It's the result of gradually gaining body fat every day. It didn't happen overnight.

Reducing body fat is the same.

It doesn't decrease significantly in a short period. It decreases little by little every day.

The reason why weight decreases rapidly when you are starving is that not only body fat but also other things are lost as well.

Eating less or fasting means consuming little or no salt and carbohydrates.

Salt and carbohydrates play a role in maintaining the body's water balance.

If you eat less salt and carbohydrates or avoid them altogether, your body will lose water weight and you will lose weight.

When a person eats food, it stays in the stomach as food or waste.

If you don't eat, your stomach will empty, and as a result, your weight will decrease.

However, losing weight like this is meaningless.

If you eat food again and obtain carbohydrates and salt, body water will return and your weight will increase.

If food and waste remain in the stomach, it will cause weight to increase again.

So unless you continue to eat less, most of the weight lost from starving will come back.

If you exercise and eat well to restore your metabolism,

Before starting a starvation diet, I return to a slightly lower weight.

That slight amount is the reduction in body fat.

However, if that's the case, losing weight by starving oneself is meaningless.

Even if I had dieted properly without starving myself, I would have lost weight similarly.

You mentioned that unless I continue to eat less, my weight will increase again.

So, if I continue to eat less and manage it, doesn't that mean I can maintain the weight I lost from starving?

I lost weight by starving myself, but since then I've been maintaining it, so I haven't experienced any yo-yo effect.

That's true.

However, saying that you will continue to eat less means that you will continue to follow a low-calorie diet.

If you continue on a low-calorie diet, there is ultimately the problem that your basal metabolic rate decreases.

In the next video, we will talk about this.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

I will make sure the next video appears on the right once it's completed.

If the video on the right is not the fourth video on basal metabolic rate,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

If you found this video helpful, please subscribe and like it.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
