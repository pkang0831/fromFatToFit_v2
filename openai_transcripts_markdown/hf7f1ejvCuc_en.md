The reason for eating vegetables while dieting is not because they are low in calories.

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

It is often said that vegetables are good for dieting because they are low in calories.

It is true that vegetables are helpful for dieting, but

The reason it is helpful is not because it is low in calories.

In this video, I would like to talk about the reasons why vegetables are helpful for dieting.

Vegetables are low in calories, making them good for dieting.

The reason this story came about is due to feelings of fullness.

Satisfaction refers to the state of having eaten enough food that one no longer wants to eat.

To achieve this feeling of fullness, you need to physically fill your stomach.

There are many cases where people think like this.

So there are many photos like this on the internet.

When consuming vegetables, meat, and oil with the same calorie content.

This is a comparison of how full the stomach gets.

Vegetables are low in calories, so they can fill you up.

Meat and oil cannot do that, so there is a lack of satiety.

So, it means that eating a lot leads to obesity.

However, in reality, it is not like this.

People on a low-carbohydrate diet often drink a type of coffee called bulletproof coffee.

It is made by adding fats like butter or oil to coffee.

One of the reasons I drink this bulletproof coffee is because it provides a feeling of fullness.

In reality, there are quite a few people who drink bulletproof coffee instead of having a meal when they are actually hungry.

A cup of bulletproof coffee alone can't fill your stomach.

It can be said that the fat added to coffee creates a feeling of fullness.

It's not just fat that provides a feeling of fullness; protein also contributes to satiety.

In fact, protein provides a feeling of fullness.

When creating a diet plan, it's said that you should include enough protein.

So, the nutrients themselves have the effect of providing a feeling of fullness.

To feel full, it is not necessary to completely fill the stomach.

It doesn't have to be completely filled.

Just because a vegetable is large in volume but low in calories doesn't mean it's better for dieting.

Vegetables themselves are good for dieting, but

The reason vegetables are good for dieting is not just because they are low in calories.

So, why should we eat vegetables when dieting?

There are several reasons why vegetables are helpful for dieting.

The main reason is that it helps to suppress the rise in blood sugar levels.

When we eat food, nutrients enter our bodies.

To process that nutrient, a hormone called insulin is released.

This insulin lowers blood sugar levels that have risen due to carbohydrates.

Help proteins to be used for muscle synthesis.

It stores fat as body fat.

It is a hormone that is responsible for processing the nutrients from the food we eat.

There are hormones in our body that are essential.

If this insulin becomes excessive,

There is a problem that obesity occurs as body fat increases.

One of the reasons for excessive insulin production is a rapid increase in blood sugar levels.

As mentioned earlier, insulin works to lower blood sugar levels.

When blood sugar rises quickly and significantly,

To lower that blood sugar, insulin is released quickly and in large amounts.

So, foods that quickly and significantly raise blood sugar levels are one of the causes of obesity.

However, the dietary fiber in vegetables has the effect of suppressing the rise in blood sugar levels.

How effective is the suppression of blood sugar rise by vegetables?

There is an experiment that can be verified.

Among Korean ramen, there is a type called Bibimmyeon.

If you eat bibim-myeon and then measure your blood sugar levels,

Before the meal, my blood sugar was 116, but it rises to 185.

The level of blood sugar rises significantly.

Blood sugar levels continue to rise for two hours after eating.

However, if you eat the same bibim-myeon along with vegetables (210g),

The blood sugar level, which was 122 before the meal, did not even reach 140.

Blood sugar peaks one hour after eating and actually decreases two hours after eating.

Even if you eat the same food, if you eat vegetables along with it, your blood sugar will rise less.

So in the end, vegetables are helpful for dieting, right?

So, can't you just eat vegetables?

Is it necessary to understand exactly why vegetables are helpful for dieting?

You need to know.

There are quite a few cases where people suffer losses due to misunderstandings or lack of knowledge.

If you follow a low-calorie diet that reduces your food intake, your body's metabolism will decrease.

When the body's metabolism decreases, it becomes easier to gain weight.

You shouldn't starve yourself to lose weight because it can lead to yo-yo dieting.

There is a story like this.

However, if that story is combined with the idea that vegetables are low in calories and good for dieting,

A strange theory is born.

The concept of fasting is interpreted in terms of volume.

Eating a low-calorie diet composed of many vegetables.

Since I eat a lot of vegetables, I don't think I'm eating less or starving myself.

In reality, if you eat less or starve yourself to lose weight, you will experience a yo-yo effect.

While saying that one should diet while eating,

Many people suggest eating salad or konjac.

However, the reason the body's metabolism decreases in the first place is not due to the volume of food.

It's because of the calories in that food.

No matter how large the volume of the food I eat is,

If the calories obtained from that food are low, then it is a low-calorie diet.

Following a low-calorie diet will decrease your metabolic rate.

But I didn't know this.

Many people are unaware that they are following a low-calorie diet.

In fact, looking at the comments on my video, there are comments about diets where people say they still feel hungry even after eating a lot.

There have been quite a few cases where the diet is composed solely of low-calorie, high-volume foods like vegetables.

I am on a low-calorie diet, but they don't know that.

And if you're lacking calories, you will continue to feel hungry.

If you try to fill the hunger caused by this calorie deficit with vegetables,

I am eating more and more vegetables.

This can cause the stomach to expand, which can lead to problems.

The reason why vegetables are good for dieting is often misunderstood, leading to missed opportunities.

This time, the reason why vegetables are good for dieting is...

Let's look at cases where people suffer losses because they don't know that it suppresses the rise in blood sugar.

As I mentioned at the beginning of the video,

Even if you eat ramen made with flour noodles and a sauce that contains sugar,

When you eat vegetables together, your blood sugar doesn't rise that much.

If the rise in blood sugar is suppressed to this extent even when eating ramen,

The sauces you include in your diet plan are not really a problem.

So if you include vegetables in your diet plan,

You don't need to worry too much about adding the sauce.

Delicious sauces contain sugar and calories, but

Vegetables suppress the rise in blood sugar, preventing excessive insulin production.

If insulin is not produced in sufficient amounts,

Even with calories, body fat doesn't increase significantly.

The glucagon hormone, which helps burn body fat, is released quickly.

It does not interfere with the diet.

A person who understands this mechanism

I don't have any particular aversion to adding sauces to my diet meals.

So at least the diet isn't tasteless, making it easier to stick to.

On the other hand, a person who does not know this...

Because of the sugar and calories in the source, I'm afraid I won't be able to diet or that I might gain weight.

I try to avoid eating sauce as much as possible.

That's why diet meals are so unappetizing, and this makes it difficult for me to stick to my diet.

There are many cases where people binge on spicy food or give up on their diet.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

To achieve the first sense of fullness, there is a recognition that the upper part needs to be filled.

There is a saying that vegetables, which are large in volume but low in calories, are good for dieting.

To feel full, it is not necessary to fill the stomach.

The statement that vegetables are low in calories and therefore good for dieting is incorrect.

There are several reasons why the second vegetable is helpful for dieting, but...

The main reason is to suppress the rise in blood sugar levels.

If you don't know why the third vegetable is helpful for dieting,

While following a low-calorie diet, I sometimes don't realize that.

You can add sauces to your diet meals to make them taste good.

There are cases where people give up on their diet because they eat poorly without knowing that.

It is good to know why vegetables are helpful for dieting.

It can be organized like this.

Is there another reason besides suppressing blood sugar levels that vegetables are good for dieting?

Yes, there is.

Vegetables contain a variety of vitamins and minerals.

This is also helpful for dieting.

And in the intestines, where food is digested and absorbed, there are countless microorganisms living.

The composition of gut microbiota has a significant impact on obesity and dieting.

Vegetables can change the composition of gut microorganisms in a way that helps with dieting.

Clearly understand the reasons why vegetables are helpful for dieting.

I hope you make good use of it and succeed in your diet.

You mentioned that following a low-calorie diet can lower metabolism, which is not good for dieting.

So how should I go about dieting?

By following a low-calorie diet, the body needs to become deficient in calories in order to use body fat as energy.

You need to use body fat as energy for body fat to decrease and for dieting to be effective.

To reduce body fat, you need to use body fat as energy.

To do that, you need to put your body in a state of energy deficiency.

This is the basic concept of dieting that many people have.

In reality, it is not like that.

It is possible to reduce body fat and diet without putting the body in a state of energy deficiency.

It's difficult to obtain all the vitamins and minerals needed in a day solely from food.

I've heard that you should take supplements.

So, aren't the vitamins and minerals in vegetables not very helpful for dieting?

There is such a story, but it is not true.

In the past, there was a question about nutritional supplements and aids, so I made a video about it.
