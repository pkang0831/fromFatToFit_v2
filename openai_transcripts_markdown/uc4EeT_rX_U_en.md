Hello, this is pkang.

A question about cellulite has come up, so this is the second video I'm making about cellulite.

The link to Part 1 of the video is displayed in the upper right corner, so those who want to watch Part 1 can click on it to view.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it is recommended that you watch it if possible.

In Part 1 of the video, we learned about cellulite related to obesity.

In this video, we will talk about people who have a normal weight but have cellulite.

As those who watched the subcutaneous fat video linked in Part 1 know,

In the case of men, due to having a higher muscle mass, body fat tends to accumulate primarily as visceral fat.

In the case of women, because they have less muscle mass, body fat tends to accumulate primarily as subcutaneous fat.

To reduce body fat, exercise is essential.

Women's diets are often more focused on diet rather than exercise.

However, as mentioned in the third video about subcutaneous fat,

It is quite difficult to reduce body fat solely through diet without exercise.

As a result, many people choose to skip meals or opt for low-calorie diets in order to reduce their body fat by further decreasing their food intake.

In the case of a low-calorie diet, there is the issue of muscle loss.

When muscle mass decreases, the need for subcutaneous fat to take over the functions that the original muscle performed increases.

Then the amount of muscle decreases and subcutaneous fat increases.

A low-calorie diet does lead to weight loss, but...

Muscle and subcutaneous fat have a significant difference in weight.

Muscle is much heavier than fat.

So, when the amount of heavy muscle decreases and the amount of light subcutaneous fat increases,

The amount of subcutaneous fat can increase, but the overall weight can still decrease.

I heard that there isn't much difference in weight between muscle and fat, is that true?

In the past, there were many stories that the weight of muscle is more than twice that of fat.

Recently, there has been a lot of talk about how there isn't much difference in weight between muscle and fat.

I received a question about which side is correct, and I previously made a response video about it.

The link to the video is displayed at the top right, so if you're curious about the details, you can click and watch it.

To summarize the conclusion of that video,

When comparing the weight of pure muscle to the weight of fat, there is no difference in weight between muscle and fat.

When comparing weight gain due to muscle and weight gain due to subcutaneous fat,

The weight gained from muscle can be more than twice the weight gained from subcutaneous fat.

As mentioned earlier, even if muscle mass decreases and the amount of subcutaneous fat increases,

Your weight can decrease.

In the case of such a person, their weight is considered to be quite light.

The amount of fat in the body can be similar to or even greater than that of obesity.

This type of person is called "skinny fat."

In the case of skinny obesity, the weight may be normal or even lighter, but...

Due to the large amount of subcutaneous fat, cellulite develops as mentioned in the first part of the video.

This is also ultimately due to having a lot of body fat, which is why cellulite forms.

Please refer to the video on how to reduce subcutaneous fat, which I linked in Part 1.

By exercising to reduce the amount of body fat, you can decrease cellulite.

However, when you exercise, it causes injuries to the muscles, and these injuries lead to inflammation.

The inflammation and subcutaneous fat clump together, worsening the cellulite.

They say not to do intense exercises that build muscle.

To actually build muscle, you need to apply stress to the muscles.

It is true that during the process of applying load to the muscles, injuries and inflammation occur in the muscles.

It is true that when inflammation like this occurs and the subcutaneous fat clumps together, cellulite is formed.

So there are people who say that you shouldn't do exercises to build muscle and should only do stretching and massage.

To summarize...

If there is a lot of subcutaneous fat, cellulite can form due to inflammation of the subcutaneous fat.

To eliminate cellulite, you need to reduce subcutaneous fat.

To reduce body fat, you need to exercise.

When you exercise, cellulite can occur due to inflammation in the muscles.

Then I can't do this or that.

What should I do in this situation?

In the next video, I will talk about very thin, underweight cellulite that has low muscle and subcutaneous fat.

The story presented in the following video provides answers regarding cellulite caused by exercise.

If you watch the following video, you should be able to understand what you need to do.

I will upload the link to the completed video in the top right corner.

If the link doesn't appear, I am in the process of making the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few days.
