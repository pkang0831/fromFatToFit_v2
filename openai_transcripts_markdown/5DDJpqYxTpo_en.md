Why is insulin resistance bad for dieting?

I would like to discuss this question that has come up.

First, let's read the content of the question.

It's a strange question, but...

Insulin is a hormone that increases body fat, right?

Insulin resistance is when the body resists insulin, or so I've heard.

Isn't it good for dieting to resist the hormone that increases body fat?

Why is insulin resistance said to be bad for dieting?

To lose weight, is it said that you need to improve insulin resistance?

This is a question about such content. Let's discuss it in detail.

The carbohydrates we eat are converted into glucose in the body.

This glucose travels through the blood.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is called blood sugar.

If high blood sugar levels are maintained, inflammation occurs in the blood vessel walls.

When blood sugar levels rise, hormones that lower that blood sugar are released.

That is insulin.

Insulin lowers blood sugar by storing glucose in the blood as glycogen and body fat.

Help proteins to be used for muscle synthesis.

The fat we consume is stored as body fat.

I do various things, but when it comes to body fat, it is a hormone that increases body fat.

This is called the hormone that causes weight gain.

This insulin responds to carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, but

Among them, it reacts most sensitively to carbohydrates.

This is because blood sugar needs to be controlled.

If the situation of high blood sugar and insulin release occurs too often, too quickly, and in large amounts,

The body does not respond properly to insulin, which is referred to as insulin resistance.

A typical symptom is the inability to control blood sugar levels.

If you do it wrong, you can develop diabetes.

However, if we consider it based on body fat rather than blood sugar,

It means that body fat does not easily increase.

Insulin is a hormone that increases body fat.

Insulin resistance is when the body resists insulin.

Simply put, insulin resistance has the effect of preventing weight gain.

If it can prevent weight gain, it seems like it would be good for dieting.

But why is insulin resistance said to be bad for dieting?

Is it said that to lose weight, one must improve insulin resistance?

This is the question.

Because there are health issues including diabetes, it is essential to improve insulin resistance.

From the perspective of body fat, such questions can arise.

To put it simply,

There is a problem with the timing of when insulin resistance develops.

A situation where blood sugar rises and insulin is released.

If you repeat it too often and too much, it can lead to insulin resistance.

In the process of repeating this, body fat gradually increases.

As body fat increases, obesity develops, and then insulin resistance occurs.

So before body fat increases, insulin resistance develops.

It helps prevent an increase in body fat.

So it's not that I don't gain weight.

After body fat increases and obesity develops, insulin resistance occurs.

It is meaningless to resist the increase in body fat.

Body fat has already increased, and I've gained weight.

So, insulin resistance is not good for dieting.

And when insulin resistance occurs, the body becomes resistant to insulin.

You need more insulin to do the same work.

More insulin interferes with dieting.

So, it is said that in order to diet, you need to improve insulin resistance.

How does having too much insulin interfere with dieting?

Just as there is insulin, a hormone that increases body fat.

There are also hormones that reduce body fat.

These two hormones cannot be released at the same time.

Just like you can't go left while going right at the same time.

Because it is not possible to do opposing things at the same time.

When insulin resistance occurs, it was said that more insulin is needed to perform the same tasks.

The more insulin is released, the more the hormone that reduces body fat is suppressed.

When the hormones that reduce body fat are suppressed, body fat does not decrease easily.

Simply put, the diet is not working.

And this becomes a reason for eating a lot of food.

Our bodies consume energy every moment as our hearts beat and our lungs breathe.

The energy consumed in this way is called the basal metabolic rate.

Most of the energy is consumed by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and lungs.

To sustain life, energy must be supplied steadily and consistently.

To do that, some of the energy obtained from food is stored in the body.

It is meant to be taken out and used during the time when you are not eating.

However, when insulin resistance occurs, it becomes difficult to use stored body fat as energy.

If stored body fat cannot be used as energy, then energy must be obtained from external sources.

So I have no choice but to eat often.

Many people see that those with severe obesity often eat frequently.

I think I gained weight because I ate like that.

In reality, it's the opposite.

It is not because I ate like that that I became severely obese.

It's because I've become severely obese that I eat like that.

In reality, most cases of severe obesity did not start with the same amount of food being consumed from the beginning.

As I gained weight, I started eating more and more.

When people often go on a diet, they say that if you can't control your appetite, it means you lack willpower.

This is not a matter of willpower.

Due to insulin resistance, the stored energy cannot be used.

Energy is necessary for survival.

The signals to eat keep coming, and that becomes appetite.

It's a matter of survival, not willpower.

It's impressive for someone to endure such signals of survival simply through willpower.

It's not that there are not enough people who can't endure.

It is natural not to be able to endure.

So, to go on a diet, you should either reduce your meal portions or calculate your calories beforehand.

Improving insulin resistance should be the top priority.

Insulin resistance needs to be improved in order for the body to use stored body fat as energy.

This way, body fat will decrease and appetite will also decrease.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

First

Insulin resistance is when the body becomes resistant to insulin.

One of the functions of insulin is to increase body fat.

When insulin resistance occurs, it also resists the increase in body fat.

It has a certain effect in preventing an increase in body fat.

Second

The point at which insulin resistance develops is after body fat increases and obesity occurs.

Even if you prevent body fat from increasing due to insulin resistance, it is meaningless.

Third

When insulin resistance occurs, more insulin is needed to perform the same tasks.

The more insulin, which is the hormone that increases body fat, is produced,

The hormones that reduce body fat are becoming harder to produce.

So it interferes with the diet.

Because of this, it is necessary to improve insulin resistance for dieting.

I can organize it like this.

What should I do to improve insulin resistance?

You should eat foods that cause less insulin to be released.

In the diet principle video I made before, I explained this part in detail.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

I heard that insulin resistance helps prevent weight gain.

I was hopeful that by effectively utilizing insulin resistance, I could become someone who doesn't gain weight.

I guess that's not the case.

What should I do to become someone who doesn't gain weight?

I also made a video about how to become someone who doesn't gain weight.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

To reduce insulin production, it seems that one should cut down on sugary foods.

I really like sweet foods.

So I'm reducing sugar and using alternative sweeteners.

What do you think about artificial sweeteners?

Of course, it is better to consume alternative sweeteners rather than sugar.

However, in the end, it's better to gradually reduce the amount of alternative sweeteners you consume.

I explained this in detail in a video before.

I will make sure to display related videos in the bottom left.

I am working hard on my diet, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

I have lost some weight, but...

Is this because body fat has decreased, leading to weight loss?

Otherwise, it's hard to distinguish whether the body fat remains the same and only water and muscle have decreased.

Is there a way to distinguish this?

There are ways to classify obesity based on its types.

This was also a question that came up before, so I made a video about it.

I will make sure related videos appear in the bottom right corner.

You can choose and watch any video that appears on the screen that you're curious about.
