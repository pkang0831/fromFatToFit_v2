A question with this content was posted in the comments.

I watched pkang's video and I'm following the right diet, so my weight loss is going well.

I've lost almost 10 kg, but it doesn't really show.

Even if I tell my friends that I've lost 10kg, they respond as if they don't really understand.

When I look at my reflection in the mirror, I don't see much of a difference even to myself.

Of course, I've gotten a bit better compared to the first time.

Considering that I've lost 10kg, the change is too little.

When you look at female celebrities, losing just 5kg makes a noticeable difference, and if they lose 10kg, they look like a completely different person.

Why is there no difference for me?

I wonder if my body is cursed. I'm worried that even if I lose weight, there won't be any difference from now.

I'm gradually losing my motivation.

You don't need to worry too much.

The reason for this is due to the change in perception and the rate of change.

It means that although one can see the signs of change, they are unable to recognize the change itself.

The human brain is small in size but consumes 20% of the basal metabolic rate.

Because it consumes a lot of energy, there is a reaction to try to save it.

One of them is not analyzing every piece of information that you see with your eyes.

So, I can't properly perceive anything other than the object I'm focusing on.

Because of this, a kind of blindness to changes can occur, even when there are changes happening around you.

For example, a person wearing green clothes was asking for directions.

Even if this person changes to someone wearing white clothes,

There are many cases where people do not notice that someone has changed.

An actor asked a passerby for directions.

The actor changes while the surfboard passes by.

Will people notice this change?

What kind of reactions will those who notice show?

Go straight over there...  
Yes.

Then go to the left. To the left?

It seems that these people are unaware of the changes.

Please go down that way.

I really don't know.

The colors of the clothes are different, the faces are different, and the voices are different, yet it doesn't register.

Oh... that's ridiculous. Isn't it just a setup?

You can directly experience the blindness of change.

In the third part of the body transformation video, there was a brief moment where you could experience the changes.

The link is appearing at the top right.

If you want to directly experience the change blindness, you can click and check it out.

So even if there is a visible change due to weight loss,

Unless one focuses specifically, it is difficult to recognize that change.

It's natural to find it difficult to notice whether you've lost weight or not.

And when we meet people, we don't meet them in the nude.

I will meet you while wearing clothes.

It is natural that it is difficult to understand because this clothing covers my body.

Second derivative

The rate of change refers to how much it has changed in relation to the total amount.

To make it easier to understand, for example,

When there is a 1L water bottle and a 300ml water bottle.

If you take out 100ml of water from both containers equally,

In the case of 1L, the change appears to be small, while in the case of 300ml, the change appears to be significant.

A reduction of 100ml from 1L means a decrease of 10% of the total.

The reduction of 100ml from 300ml is because 30% of the total has been decreased.

So even if the same amount of weight is lost,

The higher the weight, the less noticeable the difference appears on the outside.

The lower the weight, the more noticeable the difference appears on the outside.

So in the case of severe obesity with a high weight,

In the early stages of a diet, even if I lose 10kg or 15kg, there isn't much reaction from those around me.

I have lost a lot, but since I was originally severely obese, the difference is less noticeable.

However, after getting closer to a normal weight,

You can immediately notice even a loss of just 1kg or 2kg.

A person who weighs 100kg may not see a significant difference even after losing 10kg and weighing 90kg, but...

A person who weighs 55kg will experience a significant difference when they lose 10kg and weigh 45kg.

So, the 10 kg that I, who am severely obese, lose...

The 10 kg that a celebrity with a normal weight loses.

Although it's the same 10kg, the body appears completely different.

You need to understand this.

So, if I am severely obese,

I've lost a lot of weight, but people around me don't really notice.

And even when I look in the mirror, I still don't understand.

There’s no need to be disappointed by this. It’s just natural.

It's not like your body is cursed, and even if you reach a normal weight, your body remains the same.

When your weight gets closer to normal, even a reduction of just 1kg can show a significant change.

So, don't worry too much and don't give up. It's best to keep at it consistently.
