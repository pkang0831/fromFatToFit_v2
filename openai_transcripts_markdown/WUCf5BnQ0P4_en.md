Hello, this is pkang.

This is the second video talking about intermittent fasting.

In the first video, the causes of people overeating and becoming obese are discussed.

We talked about why fasting time is necessary in intermittent fasting.

Since the content of the video is continuous, it is better to watch the previous videos in order.

If you haven't seen the video in front, please click the playlist link in the top right.

You can watch the videos in order starting from the one at the front.

In this video, I will discuss how the reactions of people practicing intermittent fasting can be divided into two categories.

Looking at the reactions of people who practice intermittent fasting,

Some people used to eat frequently because they couldn't stand hunger before starting intermittent fasting.

Since I started intermittent fasting, I have been able to better control my appetite.

So, I say that keeping the fasting hours is not that difficult.

Some people want to try intermittent fasting, but...

Some people say that it's really hard to stick to the fasting hours, so they can't do intermittent fasting.

I will talk about why this difference occurs.

To conclude, the difference lies between those who apply the content of Part 1 and those who do not.

In Part 1 of the video, the reason people feel hungry and eat every 3 to 4 hours is explained.

It was said that it is due to fake hunger caused by processed foods.

If you reduce your intake of processed foods,

Since there is no false hunger, the feeling of fullness lasts for about 6 to 7 hours.

If you look at a low-carb, high-fat diet that absolutely prohibits the consumption of processed foods,

The feeling of fullness lasts a long time, so the number of meals naturally decreases.

There are a lot of reviews saying that they don't feel hungry.

So, while actually following a low-carb, high-fat diet, I also incorporate intermittent fasting.

Many people often combine intermittent fasting with a low-carb, high-fat diet.

So what it comes down to is...

When the eating time is set from 12 PM to 8 PM,

If you have a meal at 12 o'clock with unrefined food,

I start to feel hungry around 6 to 7 hours from now, which would be around 6 to 7 PM.

If you eat unrefined food again at this time,

I only start to feel hungry around 1 to 2 AM, which is about 6 to 7 hours later.

Since this time is already when people are sleeping, it's not difficult to stick to the fasting hours.

So, the person who says that it is not difficult to stick to the fasting hours

This refers to individuals who either eat unrefined foods or have reduced their intake of refined foods.

In that case, the people who find it difficult to stick to fasting times are those who consume processed foods.

For example, if you set the eating time from 12 PM to 8 PM,

If you ate processed food at 12 o'clock, you will start to feel false hunger around 3 or 4 PM, about 3 to 4 hours later.

Since it's still a time when you can eat until 8 PM, I usually have a light snack during this time.

The food eaten at this time would naturally be refined food, right?

Then, even if I have a snack at 4 o'clock, I feel fake hunger again around 7 or 8 o'clock.

Fortunately, it’s not 8 o'clock yet, so it’s still time to eat.

So, I have dinner around 7 to 8 o'clock, and if the food I eat at that time is processed food...

I feel fake hunger again around 10 to 11 PM, which is 3 to 4 hours later.

But this is a time when you shouldn't eat, right? Because it's fasting time.

So I have to endure my hunger and just go to sleep.

I'm hungry, so I can't sleep well, and I'm constantly stressed because of this.

So I keep wanting to eat something, but I shouldn't eat during the fasting period.

Just in case, I'm searching for foods that can be eaten during fasting hours.

If you visit blogs and YouTube videos that explain intermittent fasting,

I get asked the question, "Can I eat this food during fasting hours?" really, really, really often.

However, fasting refers to not eating food in the first place.

So, there really can't be any food that you can eat during fasting hours. It doesn't make sense logically.

However, the people who ask this question are not unaware of that.

I know that it doesn't make sense logically and that it's strange.

Right now, I'm really hungry and it's very hard to bear.

I was just wondering if there are any foods that are okay to eat.

However, there are no foods that can be eaten during fasting hours.

As a result, many people give up on intermittent fasting at this stage because they can't withstand their hunger.

However, not everyone gives up intermittent fasting due to hunger.

Among them, there are those who, with strong willpower, endure hunger and adhere to the fasting schedule.

However, in the case of these individuals, they are really struggling to keep the short time limit.

There are cases where you may not see the effects of dieting or even experience an increase in body fat.

The reason for this is due to the compensatory psychology caused by fear.

I had my last meal yesterday around 7 to 8 PM, and I was really struggling with hunger after 10 PM.

It's mealtime again today.

Aren't you going to be really hungry tonight? I'm worried that it might be too hard, you know?

Last night, after struggling through a difficult fast, I find myself wanting a reward.

So, whether consciously or unconsciously,

The amount of food consumed between the 8-hour meal times gradually increases.

However, if this happens, the amount of food consumed during the 8-hour eating period gradually increases.

There may be no effect from the diet, or it may even lead to an increase in body fat.

As more and more people like this appear,

You should practice intermittent fasting, not intermittent binge eating.

Intermittent fasting is important not only for the fasting duration but also for other factors.

The discussion is that the food consumed during meal times should not exceed X calories.

However, the fundamental reason is that eating processed foods creates false hunger.

It's hard to stick to the fasting hours because of this.

I need to change refined foods to unrefined ones, but I don't have any information on this.

Such mistakes keep happening.

To summarize, understand the content of Part 1 of the video.

Those who have changed their diet to a non-processed food type find intermittent fasting not very difficult.

However, without knowing the content of Part 1 of the video,

For those who believe that "just having a fasting period is enough,"

There are many cases where refined foods are consumed during meal times.

Eating processed foods makes it difficult to stick to fasting periods due to false hunger.

The problem is that people don't realize that these processed foods are the cause.

The reason I fail at intermittent fasting is...

I often think that it's because my willpower is weak that I couldn't stick to the fasting schedule.

Then, when you fail at intermittent fasting and try again,

I just strongly ignite the will to "work hard," but I don't change the types of food I eat.

Then you'll fail again for the same reason.

And then I challenge again and fail for the same reason.

If this continues to repeat,

Well, other people seem to be successfully losing weight with intermittent fasting.

Why am I so weak-willed that I can't even endure those 16 hours and keep failing?

I often find myself belittling or blaming myself like this.

However, a person who can control their appetite while eating processed foods is considered normal.

A person who cannot endure is not weak-willed.

The ability to endure is truly a remarkable trait possessed by only a very small number of people.

It's normal to struggle with appetite while eating processed foods. Most people can't resist it.

That's why the number of obese people worldwide is gradually increasing, as staple foods are processed foods.

So, don't belittle or blame yourself.

If you have failed at intermittent fasting for such reasons and are planning to challenge yourself again this time,

This time, I recommend trying unrefined foods.

However, there are people who say that you can eat anything as long as you do intermittent fasting, right?

I am eating unprocessed foods as you suggested, but I find it difficult to stick to a 16-hour fast. Why is that?

In the following video, I will discuss these two questions in order.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not the intermittent fasting part 3 video.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
