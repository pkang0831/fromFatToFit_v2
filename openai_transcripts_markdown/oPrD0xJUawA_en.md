The reason you want to eat snacks even when you're full while on a diet.

There are comments saying that even though I ate a filling diet meal, I still want to eat snacks or cake.

There are several comments with similar content, and if you look at the ones with a high number of upvotes for each comment,

It seems that there are quite a few people who have similar concerns.

So in this video, I ate a filling diet meal.

Let's find out the reasons why we crave snacks or cake again.

The causes of this phenomenon can be broadly categorized into four main types.

The first is processed food.

The second is the imbalance of nutrients.

The third is the desire to chew.

The fourth issue is related to the digestive system.

Let's talk about them one by one in order.

First, I've already talked about processed foods in many videos.

Processed refined foods trigger the secretion of large amounts of insulin.

A large amount of insulin increases appetite, making you want to eat snacks or cake.

Because it increases body fat and makes us obese.

In a diet, it is most important to reduce the intake of refined foods and eat unrefined foods.

If you are not familiar with the concepts of refined and unrefined foods,

Some people mistakenly think that only difficult-to-eat diet foods like chicken breast salad are unrefined foods.

That's not true.

It's just a common meal that we usually eat, but it's consumed in a less processed form.

In the video "[How to Distinguish Between Fatty Foods and Weight-Loss Foods]," this topic was covered in detail.

The video link is available in the top right corner.

If you don't understand the concepts of refined and unrefined foods, it's a good idea to click and watch the video.

Those who have been eating processed foods can simply switch to a whole food diet.

The desire for snacks or cakes can be significantly reduced.

If you have already seen that video and understood the concept of unrefined foods,

So I am structuring my diet with unprocessed foods.

Even after eating a hearty meal, if you still have a craving for snacks or cake,

There may be an issue with the composition of the diet.

This is something I talked about in the satiety series I created before.

When you gather foods that are said to be good for dieting and have high satiety, there is something strange about them.

For example, vegetables like cabbage and leafy greens are said to be foods that provide a good feeling of fullness.

And chicken breast is also said to be a food that provides a good feeling of fullness.

Lastly, it is said that bulletproof coffee, made by adding fat to coffee, also provides a feeling of fullness.

Cabbage and leafy greens are carbohydrate foods that are low in protein and fat.

Chicken breast is a protein food that is low in carbohydrates and fat.

Bulletproof coffee is a fatty food that is low in carbohydrates and protein.

So, even just having carbohydrates can provide a feeling of fullness.

Foods that provide a feeling of fullness even with just protein.

It means that even just fat can be a food that provides a feeling of fullness.

So even if you focus your diet on a single nutrient,

It means that you can feel full and satisfied with that diet.

The problem is that while this diet can create a feeling of fullness,

A phenomenon occurs where a feeling of hunger coexists with a lack of essential nutrients.

I'm full, but I still want to eat something.

A typical example is the salad diet and the ketogenic diet.

The salad diet is a diet that consists only of salads, but it does not restrict the quantity.

So if it's a salad, it's a meal that can fill you up.

However, no matter how much I eat a lot of salad, I still feel a false sense of fullness.

I start craving greasy foods, snacks, and cake.

The reason this phenomenon occurs is due to a feeling of hunger caused by a lack of fat.

The ketogenic diet is a diet that restricts carbohydrates.

There are no restrictions on the amount of food or calories consumed at all.

So if you want to eat, up to 3000 calories is allowed.

Even after eating like that, there is still a desire to have snacks.

So there are also special snacks called keto snacks.

If you have had a sufficient amount of food, it is normal not to want snacks.

You want to snack because you're feeling hungry due to a lack of carbohydrates.

The problem can be easily resolved by simply addressing the deficiency of a specific nutrient.

After following my diet plan, I crave snacks or cake.

Is this a lack of carbohydrates?

It is possible that there is a deficiency in carbohydrates.

There is also a possibility of a deficiency in fat.

Snacks and cakes are sweet and have a high carbohydrate content, so

It's easy to think that you would want to eat when you're low on carbohydrates.

Cakes and snacks are also high-calorie foods.

So, when there is a lack of fat, you may still feel like eating.

If the intake of fat is insufficient, the overall caloric intake will decrease.

As a way to fill in this calorie deficit,

I am looking for foods that I used to eat that are quickly digested and absorbed, yet high in calories.

This includes snacks or cakes.

When eating unprocessed foods, you don't have to worry about calories.

During a diet, I tend to unconsciously try to reduce my fat intake.

This phenomenon often occurs due to a lack of fat.

If we look at the people who left questions in the comments,

There are very detailed notes on how much carbohydrates are being consumed.

Most of the time, people do not keep track of how much fat they are consuming.

You are either not eating fat or not thinking about fat at all.

In that case, we need to identify whether carbohydrates or fats are the problem and find a solution.

The method to identify the cause and find a solution is very simple.

You can try adding carbohydrates or fats while continuing to eat your usual diet.

You can try eating an additional half bowl of rice or about 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil.

When additional bib or oil is consumed.

If the desire for snacks or cake decreases and it becomes easier to stick to a diet,

It means that that nutrient was lacking in my diet.

I will summarize.

Humans need a balanced intake of all nutrients.

If you restrict a specific nutrient too much, you will experience hunger due to that nutrient.

Due to this feeling of hunger, I tend to eat larger portions when I have my meals.

Even if you have eaten enough from your diet, you may still feel a desire to eat snacks or cake.

The desire to eat snacks or cake makes it difficult to stick to a diet.

Even if you stick to your diet with difficulty,

If you keep eating more and more, it won't be good for your diet in the end.

Among those who actually follow a ketogenic diet,

I tried to satisfy my hunger caused by carbohydrates by eating meat.

I sometimes eat more than 1 kg of meat in a day.

Due to the characteristics of the ketogenic diet, even if you eat like this, you may not gain weight.

This is also overeating, so my diet isn't going well.

In this case, eating about half a bowl of brown rice would be good.

I'm so full that I can barely eat half of the meat and end up leaving some behind.

Eating a lot is indeed a cause of obesity, but

That said, completely avoiding food or severely restricting it is not a good diet.

It is important to eat moderately and not overeat.

Let go of the mindset that you need to restrict any specific nutrients.

It is a good idea to check if there is anything lacking in the diet I am currently following.

I am someone who makes sure to eat a balanced diet with carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

I just can't give up snacks because of their crispy texture.

I thought about trying to eat something instead of nuts, but I ended up eating too many nuts.

What should I do about this?

In the next video, we will explore the cravings for snacks due to texture.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not about texture and snacks,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
