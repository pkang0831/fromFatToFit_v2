What happens in my intestines when I do a starvation diet?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the sixth video about gut microbiota.

In the last video, we discussed how there are countless gut microorganisms living in our intestines.

The more beneficial bacteria that provide good effects for the body, the more it helps with dieting.

It was said that the more harmful bacteria that have a negative effect on the body, the more likely one is to become obese.

To lose weight, it is necessary to reduce harmful bacteria and increase beneficial bacteria.

An interesting question has come up here.

The body of a person who is already obese likely has more harmful bacteria than beneficial bacteria.

In such a situation, even if you change your eating habits,

A small number of beneficial bacteria find it difficult to overcome a large number of harmful bacteria.

Therefore, it seems that it will take a long time to change the composition of the gut microbiota.

If the gut microorganisms are going to thrive on the food I eat anyway,

I am undergoing a long-term fast where I do not eat any food at all.

Minimize the number of gut microorganisms as much as possible.

If you eat foods that serve as nourishment for beneficial bacteria afterwards,

Since the harmful bacteria that inhibit the growth of beneficial bacteria have decreased,

Isn't it possible to change the composition of gut microorganisms much more quickly to have more beneficial bacteria?

This is a question of this kind.

To put it simply, that won't happen.

There are two main reasons.

The first reason is that harmful bacteria multiply much faster than beneficial bacteria.

The second reason is that after a prolonged fast, it is difficult to consume food that nourishes beneficial bacteria.

When you contract bacterial infections such as pneumonia or gastroenteritis, antibiotics are used.

This antibiotic is a medication we take to kill the pathogens that make us sick, but

Since it is a drug that kills bacteria, it also causes significant harm to both beneficial and harmful microorganisms in the gut.

So, what happens if this antibiotic is administered for a long period?

There is an experiment conducted on mice.

The experiment was conducted over 28 weeks by dividing the mice into four groups.

The first group of rats was continuously administered antibiotics for 28 weeks.

The second group was given antibiotics only until they were 8 weeks old.

The third group was given antibiotics only until they were 4 weeks old.

The fourth group did not receive antibiotics.

After 28 weeks, we compared the weights of each group.

The longer the duration of antibiotic treatment, the higher the weight was recorded.

So, the longer antibiotics are administered, the greater the damage to the gut microbiota.

It means that it becomes easier to become obese.

When antibiotics cause significant damage to gut microorganisms.

It means that harmful bacteria recover from damage and regain their strength more quickly than beneficial bacteria.

In that case, would humans also show similar results to the rat experiments when taking antibiotics?

Since it is not possible to conduct long-term human trials with antibiotics on people,

Experiments are mainly conducted through tracking and observation.

However, similar results came out here as well.

A study was conducted in the United States to analyze the relationship between antibiotic treatment and childhood obesity.

A child who has received antibiotic treatment more than nine times during the first 48 months of life is

The likelihood of becoming obese in childhood was more than twice as high.

So, even if it is possible to fast until the number of gut microorganisms decreases,

That doesn't mean it helps increase beneficial bacteria.

After the second long-term fast, it is difficult to consume food for beneficial bacteria.

If you follow a starvation diet or a low-calorie diet, your basal metabolic rate will decrease.

This is something that anyone interested in dieting would know.

Basal metabolic rate also includes the energy consumed by the digestive system.

A decrease in basal metabolic rate also means that the digestive system is weakening.

So it becomes difficult to digest food.

In reality, if you eat regular food after fasting for a long time, it can cause digestive issues.

It is said that one should have a soft diet for recovery.

The problem is that the food that beneficial bacteria feed on is mainly unprocessed food.

Most of these foods are coarse foods.

In a state where the digestive system has weakened due to prolonged fasting,

Eating such rough food is quite difficult.

In reality, people who maintain a low-calorie diet for a long time for the purpose of dieting are...

The desire for processed foods such as snacks, chocolate, and cake increases.

I had a subscriber like that, and I even made a video based on their story.

So to summarize,

Eating less or starving oneself does not help with dieting in any way.

Because the calorie intake decreases, it is possible to temporarily lose weight.

The metabolic rate of the body decreases or

As the proportion of harmful bacteria among gut microorganisms increases,

It becomes easy to gain weight.

In reality, most people who lose weight by eating less or starving themselves experience a yo-yo effect.

To diet, you don't have to eat less or starve yourself.

You need to change the types of food you eat.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.

You mentioned that eating less or starving is not helpful for dieting.

What do you think about intermittent fasting?

First of all, intermittent fasting is not about eating less or starving.

Utilize fasting time to avoid overeating.

The goal is to eat moderately.

When you focus too much on fasting, there are cases where you try to keep extending the fasting period.

It is important to practice intermittent fasting.

There was a question about intermittent fasting before, so I made a detailed explanation video about it.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure that a video about intermittent fasting appears in the top left.

If you would like a detailed explanation about intermittent fasting, you can click here to see it.

You mentioned that if you follow a low-calorie diet for a long time, you will start to crave snacks, chocolate, and cake.

Please tell me more about it.

In the past, I introduced a story from a subscriber who is a flight attendant and talked about it in detail.

I will make sure related videos appear in the upper right.

You can choose and watch the video you are curious about.
