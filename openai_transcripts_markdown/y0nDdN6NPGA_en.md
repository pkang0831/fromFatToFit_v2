A question has come up regarding exercise and stress.

First, let's read the content of the question.

Exercise intentionally puts stress on the body because it makes the body work hard.

Stress is the biggest enemy of dieting.

I have actually tried exercising to lose weight, but...

The more I exercise, the hungrier I get.

I ended up eating more, and as a result, I actually gained weight.

I understand that exercising to build a great body makes sense, but...

I'm not sure if exercise helps with dieting.

So I am dieting only through my diet without exercising.

I am meditating to reduce stress.

I saw a video with this content on YouTube. Is it true?

Does exercise really put stress on the body and hinder dieting?

This is a question about such content. Let's discuss it in detail.

First of all, stress is not good for dieting.

This is a true story.

The situations in which we experience stress today are quite diverse, but

In the past, situations that caused stress for humanity were primarily life-threatening situations.

In such situations, the coping methods can be broadly divided into two categories: fight and flight.

Struggle is about fighting and winning against threats to life in order to secure safety.

Escaping means fleeing from a life-threatening situation to secure safety.

Whether you choose struggle or escape

The physical ability to perform that was very important.

So in stressful situations,

In order to facilitate struggle and escape, physical abilities temporarily increase.

This is called the fight-or-flight response to stress.

When you actually experience stress, a hormone called cortisol is released.

Cortisol raises blood sugar levels to secure energy for the muscles to use.

By breathing quickly, we secure the oxygen that our muscles will use.

The oxygen and energy obtained in this way are delivered to the muscles through the blood.

To facilitate quick delivery, it also has the effect of making the heart beat faster.

You can think of it as a state of arousal that uses a lot of energy momentarily to enhance physical abilities.

In this awakened state, it consumes quite a bit of energy.

Because we need to replenish the energy consumed in this way.

It also has the effect of increasing appetite.

The reason why exercising makes you feel hungrier is because of this.

The problem is that the stress we experience in modern times is mostly unrelated to threats to our lives.

So it means doing neither struggle nor escape.

Some of the food we eat is converted into glucose in our bodies.

This glucose moves through the blood.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is called blood sugar.

When there is an increase in glucose, blood sugar levels rise.

If high blood sugar levels are maintained, inflammation occurs in the blood vessel walls.

To lower blood sugar, a hormone called insulin is released.

Insulin stores glucose in the blood as body fat, lowering blood sugar levels.

Let's remember what we've discussed so far and return to the topic of the fight-or-flight response.

When you are stressed, cortisol hormone is released, and blood sugar levels increase.

If my blood sugar has risen after eating.

At this time, the source of glucose that raises blood sugar is food.

In that case, when stress causes blood sugar levels to rise,

Where did this glucose that raised the blood sugar come from?

It must have come from somewhere in my body.

It also retrieves carbohydrates stored in the body.

Some will break down muscle to bring it in.

So, it increases blood sugar by breaking down muscle to produce glucose.

It is storing that glucose as body fat to lower blood sugar levels.

Simply put, this process means that muscle is turning into body fat.

A diet should focus on reducing body fat and increasing muscle mass.

A completely opposite situation is unfolding.

Stress is a cause of obesity because of this.

Stress is the biggest enemy of dieting.

This is how we talk about it.

Does the body experience stress when doing the second exercise?

This is also a valid point.

When you put a strong load on your body, it develops through the process of overcoming that load.

This is exercise that intentionally induces this.

You need to apply a strong load to the body to the extent that it develops, which causes the body to experience stress.

When you actually exercise, cortisol hormones are released.

When you increase the intensity of your exercise to put more strain on your body, the level of cortisol hormone also increases.

So, does that mean I should exercise lightly?

Lowering the intensity of exercise can reduce the stress on the body, but...

If this happens, the body will not develop.

It becomes meaningless to exercise.

It's true that stress is not good for dieting.

It is true that exercise can put stress on the body.

Is it true that exercise is not good for dieting?

Stress is not good for dieting.

Exercise puts stress on the body.

If you only think about the conclusion like this, it can lead to misunderstandings.

Why stress is not good for dieting.

If you think about the reason, you can realize that it is not true.

When our body experiences stress,

As a response to struggle and escape, blood sugar levels increase and appetite rises.

At this time, if you do not choose either struggle or escape,

When glucose in the blood is not used for energy, a high blood sugar level is maintained.

The problem was eating more food due to increased appetite without any energy expenditure.

So the problem arises from not doing either fighting or fleeing.

What would happen if we engage in either struggle or escape?

For example, let's say we are fighting.

In order to fight and win against life-threatening entities,

It would require a tremendous amount of physical activity.

When physical activity increases, the glucose in the blood is used as energy.

When glucose is used for energy, blood sugar levels decrease.

And having an increased appetite and eating more food is

It becomes a way to replenish the energy consumed through struggle.

In the first place, it was a problem because nothing was being done between struggle and escape.

Choosing either struggle or escape is not a problem.

Exercise is about fighting against and overcoming the load placed on my body.

If we categorize it as struggle and escape, it falls under struggle.

So, the problems caused by stress from exercise can be resolved through exercise itself.

Stress from exercise does not hinder dieting.

The stress that hinders dieting does not come from exercise.

The chronic stress that we continuously experience in our daily lives is the problem.

To summarize the content so far in three points:

The first modern situation in which we experience stress is diverse, but...

In the past, situations that caused stress for humanity were primarily life-threatening situations.

To survive in such a situation,

Because I had to choose between struggle and escape.

Physical abilities are enhanced to favor struggle and escape.

If you choose neither struggle nor escape at this time, problems will arise.

That issue negatively affects the diet.

The second exercise involves intentionally placing a load on the body.

Because this subordinate causes stress.

It is true that exercising puts stress on the body.

In the third stressful situation, the problem is that doing neither fight nor flight is an issue.

Exercise corresponds to a struggle against and overcoming the load placed on the body.

Therefore, the stress caused by exercise can be resolved through the exercise itself.

Stress caused by exercise does not negatively affect dieting.

I can organize it like this.

The elevated blood sugar due to the fight-or-flight response is

I understand that it's not a problem because it decreases when I exercise.

Since I used up energy by exercising,

I don't quite understand that it's okay to have an increased appetite.

I burned energy through exercise and reduced body fat, but...

If your appetite increases and you eat that much,

Since body fat is increasing again, I'm not losing weight.

Doesn't that have a negative impact on dieting?

If you expend energy through exercise, you will lose body fat equivalent to that energy.

Thinking this way raises such questions.

However, the reduction of body fat does not depend solely on the energy expended through exercise.

This part was explained in detail in another video.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

Why doesn't body fat decrease according to the energy expended through exercise?

If you're curious, you can click to see it.

I know that the calories burned through exercise are not as much as one might think.

After exercising, my appetite increased.

So there are cases where people fail their diet by eating high-calorie foods.

How do I do this?

You need to change the types of food you eat.

Why we need to change the food we eat and how to change it.

I explained the principles of dieting in detail before.

I will make sure to have related videos appear in the upper right.

If you eat foods that significantly raise your blood sugar levels,

I understand that a lot of insulin can lead to weight gain.

Earlier, when my blood sugar rose due to the fight-or-flight response.

You mentioned that exercising uses glucose in the blood for energy, which lowers blood sugar levels.

In that case, if you exercise when your blood sugar rises after eating,

Can preventing blood sugar from rising help avoid gaining weight?

It is possible.

In fact, walking for about 10 minutes after a meal lowers post-meal blood sugar levels.

By consistently repeating this, there is an experiment that shows a weight loss of 3 kg in a month.

I talked in detail about it in the post-meal walking series I created before.
