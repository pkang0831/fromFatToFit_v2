The topic of this video is

I will talk about diet, carbohydrates, and hydration.

There is a lot of information about the relationship between diet and carbohydrates.

There are also discussions about carbohydrates, insulin response, and the increase in body fat.

There is also a discussion about carbohydrates and glycogen in relation to exercise.

However, there isn't much discussion about moisture.

So I brought a theory related to moisture.

First, let's take a look at what dieting is.

Losing the excess fat that has accumulated in the body is what we call dieting.

To achieve this, you need to burn body fat.

If you ask what is needed for body fat to be burned,

They say that a large amount of oxygen and water is needed.

There is a lot of information available on the internet, and many fitness trainers also talk about it.

When dieting, it's often said that you should drink a lot of water.

In actual success stories about dieting, there are many mentions of drinking 3 liters or 4 liters of water a day.

When I drink a lot of water, I go through 8 bottles of 500ml PET bottles.

So I have eaten 4 liters every day.

It was quite difficult to eat, but since it's good for the body, I gave it a try.

However, those who have tried drinking water like this will know that...

If I drink this much water, I have to go to the bathroom a lot.

And this is a bit of a dirty story, but...

The color of the urine is not initially a dark yellow, but it does have a yellow tint.

However, the more I go to the bathroom, the lighter the color becomes.

Eventually, it becomes colorless, not much different from water.

So at first, since I'm drinking a lot of water, it's only natural that I go to the bathroom often.

Since I go to the bathroom a lot, I thought it was natural for the color of my urine to become lighter.

I discover a book and my thoughts change.

The book is called "Don't Drink Water."

The book title is very attention-grabbing.

Water is the source of life, and it is said to be good for you if you drink a lot of it.

I was curious about what it meant to say not to drink water, so I looked into the content of the book.

The content mentioned in the book includes three main points that are connected to the video.

The first topic is about the amount of water that needs to be consumed.

When talking about water in Korea

You should drink 2 liters a day.

Modern people are suffering from chronic dehydration.

There is a saying that you should drink water before you get thirsty.

The reason this story has come up is that

The human body continuously consumes moisture every hour.

Through saliva, sweat, urine, and feces.

Even without doing this, moisture is continuously evaporating from the skin.

After calculating the total amount consumed like this, it comes out to about 2 liters per day.

I am continuously consuming 2 liters of water a day.

If you don't replenish this by drinking water,

Of course, there will be a lack of moisture, and dehydration symptoms will occur.

Thinking that there will be health issues as a result is a very natural line of thought.

However, if the body is lacking moisture, one should feel thirsty.

Even if you don't drink 2 liters of water a day, you won't feel thirsty.

So I'm thinking, ah~ I need to drink water before I get thirsty.

So you need to drink water before you get thirsty. It is said that modern people are chronically dehydrated.

However, there is one error here.

It is correct that the amount of moisture evaporating from the human body is 2 liters.

However, obtaining moisture doesn't necessarily mean you have to drink water.

Because food also contains moisture.

When you eat fruits or vegetables, there is moisture inside, right?

Even when we eat meat, there is moisture that we refer to as juice.

Even if you don't drink water, you can still obtain moisture from the food during your meal.

If you consider the amount of this moisture that is absorbed by the body,

It’s not necessary to drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water every day.

And the second question is whether the water we drink is actually absorbed by the body.

They say that there are many positive effects when we drink water.

The skin improves.

Metabolism becomes more active, leading to weight loss.

Waste is being expelled from the body.

However, to achieve these effects, the hydration we consume must be

It is said that it needs to be absorbed into my cells.

It's a common understanding that for my skin to become firm, it needs to be hydrated.

Moisture needs to be supplied to the skin cells.

So, does the water we diligently drink actually reach our cells?

Don't you think we go to the bathroom too often?

This is where the third story begins.

Why isn't the water being absorbed?

According to what is said in this book, water is not simply absorbed by the body.

It is absorbed in the body with the help of other nutrients.

However, most of the water that modern people drink is purified because of severe environmental pollution.

However, during the process of juicing, all the unhealthy components are filtered out.

This means that all the unique nutrients in the water are also filtered out.

So only pure water remains. Just water. No nutrients at all.

So, since you're only drinking water without any nutrients, it doesn't get absorbed by the body and just passes out.

So, what kind of moisture should we consume for our bodies to absorb it?

Don't drink water. They say to eat instead of drinking water.

It means to consume the moisture found in vegetables rather than drinking water.

Vegetables contain nutrients, and when you eat vegetables, both moisture and nutrients come in together.

It gets absorbed into the body and goes to the cells.

This means that positive effects occur when you drink a lot of water.

That sounds quite plausible.

Two important points have come up here.

In order for the fat in the body to be burned, oxygen and water are needed.

Nutrients are needed to absorb moisture into the body.

Combining these two things creates a single theory.

It's about the relationship between carbohydrates and water.

Looking at the nutritional information of vegetables that should be eaten to supply moisture to the body,

Among carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, the proportion of carbohydrates is overwhelmingly high.

And there is a low-carb, high-fat diet.

Reduce carbohydrate intake to an appropriate amount.

It's a diet that slightly increases the intake of fats and proteins.

If you follow this diet, you will lose weight very quickly in the beginning.

However, the weight that decreases at this time is not due to the loss of fat in the body.

They say that moisture is being lost.

This is something that people on this diet also talk about.

Fat does decrease, but it's not all fat; a significant amount of water is also included.

In other words, water is necessary for fat to be burned.

The nutrient that helps keep this moisture in my body is carbohydrates.

To burn fat, it is necessary to have an adequate amount of carbohydrates.

Reducing carbohydrates unconditionally does not necessarily mean it will be effective for dieting.

Sounds plausible, right?

To prevent any misunderstandings, I would like to add one more point.

In the latter part of the video, it mentions that if you follow a low-carb, high-fat diet...

The moisture in the body is lost.

There was a part where it was mentioned that not losing moisture is helpful for dieting.

Based on this, you might interpret that a low-carb, high-fat diet should not be followed.

There may be some people who think that I am opposed to a low-carb, high-fat diet.

I am someone who is following a low-carb, high-fat diet.

What I'm doing is a low-carb, high-fat diet where I consume an appropriate amount of carbohydrates.

It's really unfortunate that there is information about low-carb, high-fat diets on the internet.

There are many things that are distorted and spread incorrectly.

No, I'm on a low-carb, high-fat diet, so how can I eat an appropriate amount of carbohydrates?

Aren't you insisting that eating very little is the right amount?

There are likely many people who think this way.

So for the next video, I will be making a video about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

I hope you can watch that video and then make your judgment.

Once the video is completed, I will include a link in the description below the video.

If you open the description and there is no link there,

You can think of it as still being in the process of being made.
