Hello, this is pkang.

This is the fourth video discussing intermittent fasting.

In Part 1 of the video, the most important fundamental principle of intermittent fasting is discussed.

In the second part of the video, we will discuss the reasons why some people find it difficult to practice intermittent fasting.

In the third part of the video, the reason behind the claim that it is okay to binge eat as long as you stick to the fasting hours is discussed.

We talked about what aspects of that argument are flawed.

In this video, we will understand the essence of intermittent fasting that was discussed in part one.

I am not making the mistakes that were shown in the second part of the video.

I will talk about people who find it difficult to adhere to fasting times.

Since the content of the video is all connected, it is better to watch them in order starting from the previous video.

If there is anyone who hasn't seen the previous video,

I recommend clicking the intermittent fasting playlist link in the top right corner and watching the videos in order from the beginning.

I am currently creating a series of videos on intermittent fasting.

Before creating this series, I made about two videos on intermittent fasting.

A question was posted in the comments, so I made it into a response.

The part that received the most discussion in that video was...

The question was whether it was necessary to strictly adhere to the 16-hour fasting period or not.

In my case, if I want to understand the essence of intermittent fasting and adhere to it,

I used to think that it wasn't necessary to strictly adhere to a 16-hour fast.

Because I mentioned it in the first part of the video.

People often eat too much food.

This is causing health problems, including obesity.

You shouldn't eat too often or too much. This is the essence of intermittent fasting.

So we have a fasting period during which we don't eat food.

You need to have a fasting period, and here, 16 hours is suggested as one indicator.

Not adhering to the 16-hour fasting period and only fasting for 15 hours and 59 minutes means it is ineffective.

It doesn't mean that the effect will occur after 16 hours.

The reason for suggesting a 16-hour fasting period is that it has been found to be the most effective under the same conditions.

However, that doesn't mean you have to strictly adhere to 16 hours.

If 16 hours was the most effective under the same conditions, shouldn't we stick to 16 hours?

Saying that it is the same under the same conditions means that if the conditions change, the results will change as well.

A, who does not have a lot of physical activity and works in an office job,

There is a person named B who usually has a very high level of activity and works in a physically demanding field.

These two people have a very large difference in energy expenditure.

Is the most effective fasting time for these two people exactly 16 hours?

That wouldn't be the case, of course. There is a difference in energy consumption.

If it is said that the most effective fasting time for A is 16 hours,

B, which consumes much more energy than A, enters a fasting state more quickly.

You can achieve similar effects even with fasting periods shorter than 16 hours.

If the most effective fasting time for B is 16 hours, then...

A, which consumes much less energy than B, enters a state of fasting much later.

You need to fast for longer than 16 hours to achieve similar effects.

Everyone has different living environments, body fat levels, and muscle mass, as well as varying levels of activity and exercise.

Without considering these factors, we cannot say that a 16-hour fast is the best for everyone.

So, in the case of people who have a lot of activity and exercise,

Because I enter a fasting state faster than others.

Even if you eat enough unprocessed food, it can be difficult to maintain a 16-hour fasting period.

However, in this case, the entry into a fasting state is quicker than others.

Even if you don't strictly adhere to a 16-hour fast, you can still achieve similar effects.

So I hope you don't get too obsessed with the idea of "you must stick to a 16-hour fasting period."

If you try to intentionally stick to your fasting hours while forcing yourself to endure hunger,

It can actually turn into a low-calorie diet, which may hinder your weight loss efforts.

I am practicing intermittent fasting while eating unrefined foods.

It is difficult to keep the fasting hours.

If you are struggling to maintain your fasting hours and your body fat is not decreasing well,

There is a high probability of this situation occurring.

But if you don't stick to the 16-hour fasting period, isn't it incorrect to call it intermittent fasting?

That's right.

The term intermittent fasting refers to fasting for 16 hours a day or

Or it is named after a method of eating that involves fasting for 24 hours twice a week.

If either of these two conditions is not met,

The claim that it should not be called intermittent fasting is correct.

So if you say not to call this method of eating intermittent fasting, then...

I respect opinions on that matter.

However, because the essence is connected, it is possible to achieve effects similar to intermittent fasting.

If similar effects can be achieved,

I don't think it's necessary to be overly attached to the name "intermittent fasting" itself.

When food is consumed, insulin is secreted, and because insulin inhibits the burning of body fat,

I understand that fasting is necessary to prevent insulin secretion for effective dieting.

If the fasting period is short, the time during which insulin is not secreted is also short.

It seems that the diet effect might be weak. How can the same effect be achieved?

In the next video, we will discuss this question.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure to include it in the video on the right.

If the video on the right is not part 5 of intermittent fasting, then...

I'm still in the process of making the video, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
