There are many advertisements for digestive enzymes; do they have any weight loss effects?

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

A question about digestive enzymes has been posted in the comments.

Simply put, digestive enzymes are catalysts that help with digestion.

If there is a lack of this digestive enzyme, food is not digested well, and that leads to weight gain.

Let's take digestive enzymes to aid digestion and help with dieting.

With this logic, enzyme diets are becoming popular.

Many people are buying digestive enzymes.

You asked if this is really effective for dieting.

First, before considering whether taking digestive enzymes has a weight loss effect,

Do we need to take digestive enzymes? This is something we need to clarify first.

Because digestive enzymes are produced within the body, they are not lacking.

Therefore, there is no need to consume digestive enzymes themselves. There are claims regarding this.

I heard that as we age, the production of digestive enzymes decreases.

Yes, that's right.

However, as we age, our bodies weaken due to aging, and the energy our bodies consume decreases.

As the energy consumed by the body decreases, the amount of food needed also decreases.

When the amount of food needed decreases, the portion size will also decrease.

When the amount of food intake decreases, the quantity of food that needs to be digested also decreases.

Naturally, the amount of digestive enzymes needed will decrease.

So, it's true that as we age, the digestive enzymes decrease.

This is a natural phenomenon that occurs because the amount of food intake has decreased.

It means that there is no problem with this.

And while digestive enzymes are indeed catalysts that promote digestion,

Is there any significance to eating this with the mouth? There is some controversy regarding this aspect as well.

A similar example is probiotics.

In the past, there was a trend where many probiotic products were popular because they were said to be good for health.

However, the probiotics consumed orally are all killed by stomach acid in the stomach.

It became quite controversial as it was revealed that there was no effect at all.

Since then, products that ensure probiotics survive to reach the intestines have started to emerge.

The argument is that consuming digestive enzymes orally is meaningless.

However, there are actually medications that can help with digestion when taken orally, just like digestive aids.

Depending on how the digestive enzyme product is made, there may be products that aid in digestion effectively.

So to summarize,

Do you have to take digestive enzymes?

The answer to this question is no.

Does taking digestive enzyme products have a positive effect on digestion?

The answer to this question is

There may be products that are effective, although there are differences between each product.

Then, let's assume there is a digestive enzyme product that helps with digestion.

Can you achieve weight loss effects when consuming such products?

Let's talk about this from now on.

The reason we become obese is that we eat too much food.

To be precise, I ate a lot of food, and after digesting and absorbing that food, a lot of energy came into my body.

If that energy is not fully consumed and is stored as body fat, it leads to obesity.

If I say this in reverse,

Even if you eat a lot of food,

If that food is not digested and absorbed, the energy entering the body is low.

So it can be said that you won't gain weight.

In reality, what we call diet food is mostly food that is difficult to digest.

For example, dietary fiber from vegetables is said to be good for dieting.

Humans cannot digest or absorb dietary fiber.

On the contrary, when I eat dietary fiber, it hinders my digestion.

In the video I posted a few days ago, I talked about the bibim-myeon experiment.

When comparing eating bibim-myeon on its own to eating it with vegetables,

When vegetables are eaten together with bibim-myeon, it can be observed that blood sugar levels rise much less.

This phenomenon occurs because the dietary fiber in vegetables interferes with digestion and absorption.

In the same concept, both brown rice and white rice are types of rice, so they have similar nutritional content, but...

Compared to white rice without the husk, brown rice with the husk is more difficult to digest and absorb.

So, if a person who used to eat white rice switches to brown rice, they can lose weight.

So, eating a lot of food and having that food digested and absorbed quickly.

The influx of a lot of energy into the body is the cause of obesity.

Foods that are not easily digested or absorbed when eaten are being referred to as diet foods.

Anyone who knows up to this point may not fully understand what the digestive enzyme diet is.

If you eat food and take digestive enzymes to help that food digest better, then...

Isn't it rather gaining weight instead of dieting? That's what I think.

So, does that mean digestive enzymes cannot have a weight loss effect?

Then what about the people who say that taking digestive enzymes helps them with their diet?

Are you all lying?

No, that's not the case. It can be helpful depending on the situation.

Eating too much food can lead to obesity.

However, that doesn't mean that not eating and starving is the best diet method.

When you eat less, your body adapts to that situation by lowering its basal metabolic rate.

When the basal metabolic rate decreases, the energy the body consumes also decreases.

When you eat the same amount of food, it becomes easier to gain weight.

So, when you follow a low-calorie diet or starve yourself to lose weight, it often leads to a yo-yo effect.

So, the problem is that eating too much food is an issue, but...

That means eating too little food can also cause problems.

To diet effectively, you need to find the right balance.

If you eat foods that are difficult to digest and absorb, the amount absorbed by the body decreases.

If the amount absorbed by the body decreases, it can help with dieting, but...

For someone with a very poor ability to digest food, this can actually have the opposite effect.

For example, I created a diet plan consisting of foods that are difficult to digest and absorb, and I ate that.

Some people have difficulty digesting that diet plan, leading to bloating or diarrhea.

These people are having a hard time digesting food too severely.

So even if you eat a lot on a diet plan,

Since it is not digested, there are cases where the energy supplied to the body is insufficient.

This will result in effects similar to a low-calorie diet or starvation diet.

The body has a lack of energy, which leads to a decrease in the basal metabolic rate.

To replenish the lacking energy.

I develop a craving for foods that are small in volume, like snacks or cakes, but high in calories.

This makes it difficult to stick to my diet plan.

The act of dieting itself becomes difficult.

If a person like this takes digestive enzymes to aid digestion,

When I eat diet food, the symptoms of bloating or diarrhea disappear.

Since digestion is good and energy is supplied to the body,

The desire for foods like snacks or cake decreases, and you start to feel more energized.

Simply put, it means that your condition improves and it becomes easier to diet.

They are saying that taking digestive enzymes helps with dieting.

So there are actually people who experience such effects.

Those people are not necessarily lying.

So, is it good to take digestive enzymes?

It can be helpful for people who have a deficiency in digestive enzymes.

Relying too much is not good.

As we age, the core muscles weaken.

There are quite a few people who experience pain in their lower back because of that.

In this case, using a support belt to stabilize the waist can reduce back pain.

This is because the abdominal belt supports the waist in place of weakened core muscles.

In this case, the pain has decreased, but the problem has not been resolved.

The cause of the problem is weak core muscles that support the lower back.

Therefore, to solve this problem, you need to strengthen your core muscles through exercise.

If you rely solely on a support belt without exercising at all,

Because the abdominal belt continues to take over the work of the core muscles, the core muscles gradually become weaker.

If the core muscles become weaker, the problem will become more serious.

Due to a lack of digestive ability in my body, in the same context.

Problems are arising because of difficulty in digesting food.

In such a situation, taking digestive enzymes may provide immediate relief, but...

This does not mean that the problem is solved.

The cause of the problem is that my body's digestive ability is too weak.

Therefore, you need to find a way to strengthen it.

You shouldn't rely too much on digestive enzymes.

If I don't take digestive enzymes, I have trouble digesting food, which leads to stomach pain or diarrhea.

What is the reason my digestive ability has weakened?

And how can I enhance my body's digestive ability?

In the past, a flight attendant asked a similar question, so I made a response video.

I think that video will be helpful for you.

In a moment, two videos will appear on the screen.

I will have the flight attendant video playing on the left, so you can refer to it.

If you eat diet foods that are difficult to digest and absorb while your digestive ability is weakened,

The problem is that digestion is not working well.

However, by taking digestive enzymes or strengthening my body's digestive ability,

If you can make it so that there are no digestive issues even when eating foods that are difficult to digest and absorb,

Does that mean you can't diet after that?

No, that's not the case.

Even if digestion is good, it still has a dieting effect.

Because eating foods that are difficult to digest and absorb creates a dieting effect.

There was a similar question, so I made a response video.

I will make sure related videos appear on the right.

You can choose and watch the video you need from the two videos.
