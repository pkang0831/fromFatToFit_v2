The fundamental reason why dieting is difficult is appetite.

Even if I try not to eat foods that make me gain weight, I still want to eat those kinds of foods.

Even if I try not to overeat, the problem is that I want to eat until I'm stuffed.

But why do we want to eat foods that make us gain weight, and why do we want to overeat?

In this series, I would like to talk about appetite.

There are various reasons why appetite can increase to the point of obesity.

In this video, let's talk about carbohydrate addiction caused by fluctuations in blood sugar levels.

The carbohydrates we eat are converted into glucose.

This glucose spreads throughout the body via the blood.

The concentration of glucose in the blood is called blood sugar.

To make it easy to understand, let's assume there are three states of blood sugar: -1, 0, and +1.

Glucose is primarily used as energy in the brain and muscles.

When blood sugar drops to -1,

Because the brain and muscles lack the energy to use.

The brain feels unhappiness, and the muscles become weak.

If you consume carbohydrates at this time, it will raise your blood sugar levels.

As the energy used by the brain and muscles increases,

The brain feels happiness, and the muscles gain strength.

However, there are two main types of carbohydrates that we consume.

They are sometimes referred to as good carbohydrates and bad carbohydrates.

They are sometimes referred to as unrefined carbohydrates and refined carbohydrates.

What is referred to as unrefined carbohydrates is

Although it has a high carbohydrate content, it is digested and absorbed slowly.

It refers to something that is quickly digested and absorbed but has a low carbohydrate content.

For example, brown rice is a grain, so it has a high carbohydrate content.

However, the shell is structured to protect the contents.

Phytic acid and dietary fiber in the skin hinder digestion and absorption.

Digestion and absorption proceed slowly.

So the actual amount of carbohydrates that are absorbed when you eat is not that high.

On the other hand, fruits are an example of having low carbohydrate content but being quickly digested and absorbed.

The sugars in fruits are quickly digested and absorbed.

There is a saying that eating a lot of fruit can make you gain weight.

However, since fruits are made up of 80-90% water,

There aren't many carbohydrates obtained when eaten.

In fact, there are only 8g of carbohydrates in 100g of watermelon.

So eating fruit doesn't necessarily make you gain weight.

Such unrefined carbohydrates have a low carbohydrate content or are digested slowly.

Carbohydrates are digested and absorbed slowly, which causes blood sugar levels to rise gradually.

If you eat this type of carbohydrate when your blood sugar is at -1, it will only increase by one level, bringing your blood sugar to 0.

What is referred to as bad carbohydrates or refined carbohydrates is

It refers to carbohydrates that are high in content and are also quickly digested and absorbed.

The reason why brown rice is digested and absorbed slowly is because of its husk.

Conversely, if you remove this husk from brown rice, it means that digestion and absorption will be faster.

White rice is made by removing the husk of brown rice.

White rice has no husk, so it is digested and absorbed very quickly.

Since it is a grain, it also has a high carbohydrate content.

So when you eat white rice, your blood sugar levels rise quickly.

Flour made by removing the husk of wheat and grinding it.

Sugar extracted from sugarcane by squeezing, filtering, and boiling, which contains only carbohydrates.

It is a food that raises blood sugar very quickly and significantly.

Such carbohydrates raise blood sugar from a -1 state not to 0, but all the way up to +1.

And this becomes a problem.

In the beginning of the video, carbohydrates turn into glucose once they enter the body.

This glucose is used as energy in the brain and muscles.

When blood sugar rises from -1 to 0,

It was said that the brain feels happiness and the muscles gain strength.

Then what would happen if the blood sugar rises to +1 instead of being 0?

The brain feels more happiness, and the muscles become full of strength.

However, if high blood sugar levels are maintained continuously,

Inflammation occurs in the blood vessel walls, leading to various complications.

Our body tries to lower blood sugar when it rises by +1.

The hormone that does this work is called insulin.

This is where it gets important.

When blood sugar decreases from +1 to 0, it does not mean that the blood sugar level is low.

What was too high has returned to the normal range.

However, it has relatively decreased compared to +1, right?

So compared to the +1 state

The brain feels relatively unhappy, and the muscles feel relatively weak.

It's not that the actual blood sugar is low.

It means that it feels that way relatively because it went up to +1 and then dropped down to 0.

Because I feel relatively unhappy and drained of energy.

I have a desire to raise my blood sugar again.

This makes me want to eat sweet foods that are high in carbohydrates.

If you eat sweet foods and raise your blood sugar again, insulin will be secreted, causing your blood sugar to drop.

When blood sugar drops, you want to raise it again, so you start craving sweet foods.

So, refined carbohydrate foods create a craving that makes you want to keep eating them once you have them.

This is why it is said that carbohydrates can cause addiction symptoms.

So, I want to raise my blood sugar, but when it goes up, it just gets lowered again.

It means that you are trying to do opposing things simultaneously within your body.

Does this make sense?

Is the human body really this strange?

Humans originally had a diet consisting of vegetables and fruits gathered through foraging, as well as meat obtained through hunting.

At that time, I didn't eat a lot of carbohydrates.

The carbohydrates I do eat are unrefined carbohydrates.

As a result, there are cases where a lack of carbohydrates causes problems.

There were no cases of having too many carbohydrates.

However, as agriculture began, people started to consume grains that are high in carbohydrates as their staple food.

The advancement of technology has led to the processing of these grains for consumption, which has caused problems.

This is the first time in human history that we have consumed so many carbohydrates.

Since it's the first time, various problems arise, and my body is feeling confused.

Then how should we solve this problem?

The problem is the intake of refined carbohydrates that raise blood sugar too quickly and significantly.

You should reduce your intake of refined carbohydrates.

Many people say, "I originally like bread or noodles."

However, it's not that; eating bread or noodles causes fluctuations in blood sugar levels.

Because of that, you might want to eat it often, and since you eat it often, you might mistakenly think that you like it.

So, should I completely cut out carbohydrates?

No, that's not the case.

Refined carbohydrates are the problem, not carbohydrates themselves.

You can replace refined carbohydrates with unrefined carbohydrates.

You don't have to think too hard about it.

Try to reduce the intake of grains as much as possible.

You can think of it as eating raw vegetables and fruits.

If you need to eat grains, it is better to consume whole grains with the husk.

Just by doing this, you can prevent the symptoms of carbohydrate addiction caused by fluctuations in blood sugar levels.

Preventing symptoms of carbohydrate addiction can greatly help with dieting.

On the contrary, if you don't do it this way, dieting becomes very difficult.

I understand that refined carbohydrates are an issue because of blood sugar fluctuations.

Are there any issues with refined proteins or refined fats?

That could also be a problem.

In the next video, let's talk about that.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the appetite series, please wait a few more days as we are still in the process of making it.
