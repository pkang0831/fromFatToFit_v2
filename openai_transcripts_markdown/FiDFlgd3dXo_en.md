If I exercise, won't I gain weight even if I eat ramen? - Ramen Part 3

All videos have subtitles.

If there is a video where the subtitles are not visible, please turn on the YouTube subtitles.

This is the third video about whether ramen is a fattening food.

In the first video,

We discussed the claim that the nutritional content of ramen is 60% carbohydrates, which is not a problem.

In the second video,

You can cook and eat 2 or 3 packs of ramen at once.

It's because I eat ramen, rice, and snacks that I'm gaining weight.

I mentioned the claim that eating just one bowl of ramen won't make you gain weight.

In this video, I would like to discuss the claim that ramen does not make you gain weight based on exercise.

Since the content continues from the previous video, it will be easier to understand if you watch them in order.

The link to the previous video is displayed in the top right.

If you would like to watch the videos in order from the beginning, you can click to view them.

To summarize the claim that ramen does not cause weight gain based on exercise:

Even if you eat ramen, you won't gain weight if you exercise.

The problem is not eating ramen, but rather not exercising.

Ramen has a high density of carbohydrates, and it does cause a significant release of insulin when consumed.

Carbohydrates are an energy source needed for exercise, and insulin helps with muscle growth.

Some people who want to increase their muscle mass intentionally take insulin injections.

I cannot accept the explanation that ramen is not good because it is high in carbohydrates and causes a lot of insulin to be released.

It can be organized like this.

Even if you eat ramen first, you won't gain weight if you exercise.

This means that the problems that arise from eating ramen can be solved through exercise.

This is somewhat true.

As mentioned in the last video, one of the issues with ramen is the density of carbohydrates.

Looking at the nutritional components of ramen,

One serving of ramen is 120g, and out of that, 80g is carbohydrates.

If we convert it to 100g, the carbohydrates in 100g of ramen are about 66g.

Considering that the average carbohydrate content in 100g of rice is 30g,

You can see that the carbohydrate density of ramen is more than twice that of rice.

Rice, which is the main ingredient for meals, is a grain and has a relatively high density of carbohydrates.

The carbohydrate density of ramen is twice that, so we can see that it's quite significant.

The carbohydrates we eat are converted into glucose and transported through the blood.

Eating foods that are high in carbohydrate density, like ramen, can lead to...

As the number of glucose in the blood increases, blood sugar levels rise.

The problem was that this increased my appetite.

However, glucose can be stored as glycogen, which is the energy source for muscles.

The more muscle mass you have, the more glycogen you can store.

A person with a lot of physical activity and a high muscle mass

Compared to those who are not like that, a person can eat ramen without having issues with their appetite.

When looking at the testimonials of people who have succeeded in dieting through diet and exercise,

It's said that when the stomach shrinks, you feel satisfied and full even after eating just a little.

Many people have eaten less food, causing their stomachs to shrink.

Since my stomach has shrunk, I think I feel satisfied even with just a little bit of food.

That's not the case.

If you eat less food, your stomach will shrink.

So if you can feel satisfied with just a little bit...

People who are on a low-calorie diet or fasting diet have likely reduced their stomach size because they eat less.

If your stomach has shrunk and you feel satisfied with just a little food, then there shouldn't be any yo-yo effect from binge eating.

However, in reality, there is a yo-yo effect caused by binge eating.

In fact, the above is an organ that originally changes in size, expanding and contracting.

The above size is determined by appetite, not by the amount of food consumed.

Even if my stomach is full from eating a lot of food,

If there is a desire to eat more, the stomach expands, allowing for more food to be consumed.

If there is no desire to eat more, the stomach does not expand, which leads to not eating more.

In fact, a Korean broadcast conducted an experiment to film the process of the stomach expanding.

Have the experiment participants eat a hearty meal of pork belly and rice.

After taking a shot from above, there was only a small area marked with yellow dots remaining.

The stomach is almost full with a lot of food.

In fact, the participants in the experiment said that they were so full that they couldn't eat anything more.

However, when the experiment participants were shown their favorite cheesecake,

The stomach has expanded, creating extra space.

If you look at the area marked with yellow dashed lines, it has become much wider compared to before.

The experiment participant, who said they were so full that they couldn't eat anything more,

I ate all the cheesecake.

So, what's important right now is not the size of the above or how much food is in it.

Do you have a desire to eat more food? This is what is important.

When you eat foods that are high in carbohydrate density, your appetite can increase.

Even after eating enough food to feel full, the desire to eat more still arises.

The problem is that the stomach expands according to that desire, leading to increased eating.

People who usually have a lot of physical activity and a high muscle mass

Because glucose in the blood can be stored as glycogen,

When consuming foods with the same carbohydrate density

Blood sugar levels rise less in people who do not exercise and have less muscle mass.

So, there may not be a problem with increased appetite.

Because the appetite does not increase, the stomach does not expand, so one does not eat a lot.

The reason why people who have successfully lost weight through diet and exercise are satisfied even when they don't eat much is

It's not because my stomach has shrunk from eating less food.

It is because my appetite has returned to normal.

A person who exercises with the same concept is compared to someone who does not.

When eating ramen, blood sugar levels rise less.

So there may not be any issues with appetite.

For reference, I walk for about 10 minutes right after a meal.

Using glucose in the blood as energy

There is a method to lose weight by lowering blood sugar with that.

In fact, there has been an experiment where walking for 30 minutes a day, 10 minutes after each meal, resulted in a weight loss of 3 kg in a month.

Ramen is high in carbohydrates, which raises blood sugar levels.

So they say that having too much insulin is the problem.

Carbohydrates help with exercise, and insulin aids in muscle growth.

Among people who exercise, there are some who intentionally eat a lot of carbohydrates.

Some people take insulin injections to build muscle.

I don't understand why it's a problem that ramen has a high density of carbohydrates and causes a lot of insulin to be released.

First of all, it is true that carbohydrates are helpful for exercise.

As mentioned earlier, carbohydrates can become glycogen, which is the energy source for muscles.

This glycogen needs to be sufficient in order to exercise properly.

For those who exercise, it is necessary to intentionally consume more carbohydrates.

A subscriber who is actually working as a ballet dancer

I wrote a comment asking for help, so I made a response video.

Considering that I am doing a lot of ballet practice, which is no different from exercise,

There is a problem because there is a shortage of carbohydrates in the diet.

We talked throughout the entire video about the need to eat more carbohydrates.

However, if you want to consume carbohydrates for that purpose,

There are higher quality carbohydrates like potatoes, sweet potatoes, and brown rice than ramen.

There's no need to eat ramen, really.

Just because you need carbohydrates for exercising, it doesn't mean that eating ramen is justified.

The second insulin is helpful for muscle growth.

This is also a correct statement.

Insulin stores glucose in the blood as glycogen or body fat.

It also works to lower blood sugar levels.

It also helps proteins to be used for muscle synthesis.

It also stores the fat we eat as body fat.

Insulin helps with muscle growth because it aids in protein synthesis.

So there are people who take insulin injections to build muscle, but...

Just because insulin helps with muscle synthesis doesn't mean it doesn't contribute to increasing body fat.

Both are being done.

In reality, people who do weight training only eat chicken breast salad.

There is a perception that one only eats sweet potatoes and chicken breast.

The reason this perception has arisen is that insulin is necessary for muscle growth.

To prevent the fat I eat from being stored as body fat with that insulin.

This is because the intake of fat is limited as much as possible.

So to summarize,

Many of the problems that arise after eating ramen are indeed alleviated by exercising.

However, exercising can help suppress the issues related to ramen.

It's not that ramen doesn't have any problems.

The topic we are discussing right now is whether ramen is a fattening food or not.

What happens if you exercise while eating ramen? This isn't it.

Is eating ramen bad for dieting? That's the question I asked.

The answer "You just need to exercise" is close to a non sequitur.

Lastly, it is true that carbohydrates and insulin are helpful for exercise and muscle growth, but...

There’s no reason to specifically eat ramen when there are other good carbohydrates available.

Even if it helps with muscle growth, too much insulin can cause other health problems.

It's not that carbohydrates or insulin themselves are the problem.

The problem is too many carbohydrates and too much insulin.

It means that it should be reduced to an appropriate level.

Many of the problems caused by ramen can be mitigated through exercise.

If you are exercising, it's okay to have one bowl of ramen occasionally when you really crave it.

This kind of story is fine, but...

If you exercise, there is no problem with eating ramen.

I think this perspective is somewhat dangerous.

Let's wrap up this video here.

In the next video, there are people who can eat ramen without gaining weight.

I will talk about the claim that ramen is not a fattening food.

In a moment, several videos will appear on the screen.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears in the top right corner.

If the video that appears in the upper right is not part 4 of the ramen.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

You mentioned earlier that there is an experiment where walking for 10 minutes after a meal can help lose 3 kg in a month.

Please tell me more details about that experiment.

I previously talked in detail about walking after meals in a video.

I will make sure to display related videos in the top left.

You mentioned earlier that you made a video based on a subscriber's story about ballet.

In that video, you mentioned that exercising requires more carbohydrates.

I would like to see that video.

I will make sure the video appears in the bottom left.
