Vinegar Diet! Summary of How to Drink Vinegar - Part 5 on Vinegar

This is the fifth video about vinegar.

In Part 1 of the video, the principles of the vinegar diet are discussed.

In the second part of the video, tips on using vinegar.

In Part 3 of the video, the benefits of different types of vinegar are discussed.

In the fourth part of the video, the reason why some people lose weight after drinking pineapple vinegar while others do not is discussed.

I had talked about it like this.

In this video, I would like to talk about how to drink vinegar.

First, there is vinegar that is made sweet and tangy by adding sugar.

I have vinegar that doesn't contain any sugar.

In the case of vinegar with sugar, it is not difficult to mix it with water and drink it.

In the case of vinegar without sugar, it is quite difficult to drink when mixed with water.

So I understand that vinegar without sugar is better for dieting, but...

It's often the case that people choose vinegar with sugar because it's too difficult to drink.

The reason why vinegar diets became popular in South Korea is

It was after pineapple vinegar was featured on a show for its weight loss effects.

When pineapple vinegar was featured on the show, it was presented as something to be mixed with water and consumed.

To do the vinegar diet, you need to mix vinegar with water and drink it.

This perception has emerged.

However, it's not the case that you can only achieve weight loss effects by diluting vinegar in water and drinking it.

You can just sprinkle it on your food and eat it.

Vinegar is one of the ingredients used in cooking from the beginning.

The vinegar used in the food is not strong in taste or aroma, so it is not difficult to eat at all.

If you eat it this way, even vinegar without sugar is not burdensome at all.

In vinegar diet experiments, most people consume vinegar before meals.

Is it possible to lose weight by sprinkling it on food and eating it together instead of eating it before a meal?

Yes, it works.

The reason vinegar is consumed before meals in most experiments is due to variable control.

In the experiment, most conditions must be standardized except for the conditions I want to verify.

If you want to check whether vinegar has a weight loss effect,

Did you drink vinegar or not? Just change this one thing.

All the other conditions must be unified.

If someone exercises while drinking vinegar, and someone else neither drinks vinegar nor exercises.

Even if this leads to results in weight loss,

It's hard to tell whether the weight loss is due to drinking vinegar or exercising.

So, I need to unify the remaining conditions, excluding the ones I want to check.

This is called variable control.

In the vinegar experiment, to control the variables, it is necessary to standardize when and how much vinegar is consumed.

Because everyone has a different speed when it comes to eating food.

If you sprinkle vinegar on food and eat it together, or consume vinegar after a meal,

People who eat quickly also finish their meals quickly.

Compared to those who do not, the time it takes to drink vinegar becomes faster.

On the contrary, people who eat slowly will take longer to drink vinegar.

To unify the timing of drinking vinegar, we choose to drink it before meals.

This is why most experiments involve drinking vinegar before meals.

However, since we are not conducting an experiment, there is no need to control for variables.

So you can eat it in a way that is easy to eat.

If it's more convenient to drink before a meal, then you can drink it before a meal.

If it's more convenient to sprinkle it on the food and eat it together, then you can sprinkle it on the food and eat it.

If it's more convenient to drink after a meal, you can drink it after the meal.

In the first part of the video, it is mentioned that blood sugar levels peak about an hour after eating.

You mentioned that preventing this is the role of vinegar.

People who eat slowly can take almost an hour to finish their meal.

Then, the blood sugar levels are already quite high.

Isn't it meaningless to drink vinegar at this point?

So I don't really like drinking it after a meal...

The speed at which you eat also affects blood sugar, so it's not really a problem.

I often eat snacks, and I talked about it in a video with my slim friend.

We need some time to feel full after eating.

So, people who eat quickly tend to overeat before they even feel full.

On the other hand, people who eat slowly feel full before overeating and stop eating.

So there is a saying that eating slowly can help with dieting.

Since there are many foods that can quickly raise blood sugar while eating quickly,

Blood sugar levels tend to rise relatively quickly.

On the contrary, if you eat food slowly,

Foods that raise blood sugar come in slowly, so blood sugar levels also rise slowly.

So, if you eat food quickly, your blood sugar rises quickly.

Instead, because meal times are short, there is time to drink vinegar to lower blood sugar.

Eating slowly makes the meal time longer, but

Since blood sugar rises slowly, drinking vinegar gives you time to lower your blood sugar.

So drinking vinegar after a meal does not significantly reduce its effectiveness.

However, if you only drink vinegar after the meal, the vinegar smell may linger in your mouth.

If possible, it's better to drink it before meals or with food.

Finally, summarizing the benefits of vinegar according to different situations...

In the case of drinking vinegar that contains sugar while eating a regular meal,

It is difficult to expect weight loss because sugar interferes with the effects of vinegar on dieting.

However, in the video from Part 4, it is mentioned that it can help reduce weight to some extent.

In the case of drinking vinegar without sugar while eating the second general dish.

In this case, since there is no sugar in vinegar, the diet effect of vinegar becomes apparent.

However, it is naturally less effective than following a diet plan.

However, it's better to drink vinegar than not to, as it helps with dieting.

There would be no reason not to drink.

When consuming the third diet plan, if you drink vinegar that contains sugar.

In this case, sugar does offset the diet effects of vinegar, but

The diet itself gradually raises blood sugar levels, so it is not a problem from the start.

Another effect of vinegar is that it can help reduce weight.

In this case, it would be better to consume vinegar that has no sugar.

Seasoning your meals to make them tasty will help you stick to your diet.

While following the last fourth diet plan, there are cases of drinking vinegar that contains no sugar.

The diet itself gradually raises blood sugar levels.

It is difficult to expect the weight loss effects of vinegar.

However, another effect of vinegar is that it can help reduce weight.

When it's difficult to stick to your diet, like on a cheat day, using vinegar can be helpful.

In simple terms, drinking vinegar that contains sugar is better than not drinking it at all.

It is better to drink vinegar without sugar rather than vinegar with sugar, if possible.
