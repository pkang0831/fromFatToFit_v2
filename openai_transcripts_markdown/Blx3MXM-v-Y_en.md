A question with the following content was posted in the comments.

Please pause the screen and check the question content first.

I am curious about the side effects and adverse reactions when following a low-carbohydrate diet, and what foods you would recommend if one is consuming fats.

The questions can be broadly categorized into two main topics.

The first is the abnormal reactions and side effects that occur in the body when there is a lack of carbohydrates.

The second is a recommendation for foods to increase fat intake.

In this video, we will discuss the side effects and adverse reactions of carbohydrate deficiency.

First, there is one thing I need to clarify.

Since the term "low-carb diet" was used in the question, there may be a possibility of misunderstanding.

The low-carbohydrate diet is broadly divided into two types.

The first point is that we usually consume too many carbohydrates, and this leads to obesity issues.

It is about reducing carbohydrates to an appropriate level.

I refer to this for convenience as a "relative low-carb diet."

It is because the intake of carbohydrates, which is consumed in excess, has been reduced to an appropriate amount.

It's not that the amount of carbohydrates itself is insufficient.

Compared to how much I was eating before, the amount has decreased, so it's relatively low in carbohydrates.

The second is a no-carb diet, which means you shouldn't eat carbohydrates.

Alternatively, there is an absolute low-carb diet that restricts daily carbohydrate intake to 10g or 20g or less.

This means that the carbohydrate intake itself is low.

The side effects caused by a lack of carbohydrates mentioned in this video all correspond to the second type, which is an absolute low-carb diet.

There are many symptoms that appear when you either do not eat carbohydrates at all or consume them in extremely small amounts.

It can be categorized into five types based on the causes.

The first symptoms are headaches, irritability, and dizziness.

It is a symptom caused by the brain.

The brain is an organ that cannot use anything other than glucose as fuel.

However, since the raw material for glucose is carbohydrates,

When carbohydrate intake decreases, glucose levels drop, leading to symptoms caused by a lack of energy for the brain.

The second is body aches, fatigue, and lethargy.

It is a symptom caused by the energy used by the body.

The energy stored in the human body comes from two sources: fat and carbohydrates.

Fat is stored in large amounts in the body, but

It has the characteristic of not being able to drastically increase or decrease usage.

So, the energy used to maintain a constant body temperature and the energy used by internal organs comes from fat.

Carbohydrates do not have a large storage capacity, but

It has the characteristic of being able to sharply increase or decrease usage.

So, when you consume more energy than usual, your body first uses carbohydrates as energy.

In the meantime, the amount of fat is gradually increased, replacing carbohydrates.

When it is said that the required energy suddenly increases, it's easy to think about exercise.

Walking on flat ground, then walking uphill or climbing stairs also falls under the case where the energy used increases sharply.

If there is a lack of carbohydrates, there will be no energy available to supply in such situations.

Symptoms of lethargy appear, where one tries not to move at all.

If I force myself to move, I feel an intense sense of fatigue.

If you force yourself to move despite feeling fatigued, it's because your muscles are being overworked while your energy is lacking.

Symptoms of body aches may appear.

The third is constipation.

To avoid consuming carbohydrates, you need to reduce your intake of vegetables.

In that case, the nutrients such as dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals in the vegetables will be reduced.

When the body receives insufficient nutrients, the first response that is observed is...

I am trying not to let the food I currently have in my body out.

It's an action to extract as many necessary nutrients as possible from the food you currently have.

If you try not to release food, it can lead to constipation.

The fourth is muscle loss.

As mentioned briefly earlier, the brain cannot use anything other than glucose for energy.

When carbohydrate intake decreases, glucose levels drop, leading to a shortage of glucose for the brain to use.

I am trying to extract glucose from proteins and fats.

Fat breaks down body fat for use.

Protein breaks down muscle for use, which leads to a decrease in muscle mass.

However, that person has a lot of muscles because they exercise a lot.

They say that people who don't exercise and have no muscle don't experience muscle loss.

This is only partially true.

Just because someone doesn't exercise doesn't mean they have no muscles at all.

Not exercising means that the muscles in my body are the ones I always use in my daily life.

Muscles that are always used are recognized by the body as necessary, so muscle loss does not easily occur.

Muscle built through exercise does not easily experience muscle loss while you are exercising.

Muscle loss occurs when the body perceives that it doesn't need muscle due to a lack of exercise or rest.

The important thing is the second symptom that was mentioned earlier, which is lethargy.

When activity levels decrease due to lethargy, the usage of muscles also decreases.

Then the muscles I currently have are perceived as unnecessary muscles.

When muscle mass decreases due to muscle loss, the body becomes weaker, leading to increased lethargy and fatigue.

If this happens, it will become less mobile.

A vicious cycle will occur.

The fifth symptom is frequent urination, thirst, and bad breath.

This is a symptom that occurs as a byproduct.

As mentioned earlier, when carbohydrate intake decreases, the brain secures glucose for its use.

During the process of breaking down fats and proteins, various byproducts are produced.

These byproducts are excreted from the body through urine.

When there is an increase in byproducts, you will feel the need to go to the bathroom more often.

Frequent trips to the bathroom result in a significant loss of moisture through urine, which leads to a stronger feeling of thirst.

And some of these byproducts have the characteristic of causing bad breath.

Frequent urination, thirst, and bad breath occur simultaneously.

I will summarize.

If you do not eat carbohydrates, or if you eat them in very small amounts, the symptoms that may appear in your body are

Headache, irritability, dizziness.

Apathy, fatigue, body aches.

There are symptoms such as constipation, muscle loss, frequent urination, thirst, and bad breath.

This symptom does not appear the same in everyone.

Some people may exhibit symptoms, while others may not show any symptoms at all.

And other symptoms may also appear besides this.

Carbohydrates are essential nutrients for our body, and the symptoms that arise from not eating them are not forced.

It is good to consume an appropriate amount of carbohydrates.

Let's wrap up this video here.
