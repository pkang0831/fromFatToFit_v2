The reason you shouldn't stick to one diet plan continuously - Appetite Part 5

All videos have subtitles.

To briefly summarize the content of the last video,

Processed refined foods have the effect of creating false hunger.

This false hunger doesn't require food, but it makes you feel hungry.

In situations where you eat processed foods, eating whenever you are hungry can lead to obesity.

Because of this, there is a perception that in order to diet, one must endure hunger.

If you reduce refined foods and eat unrefined foods,

Because false hunger disappears.

You become satisfied with less food, and the feeling of fullness lasts longer.

It's not about enduring hunger and eating less food, but rather being satisfied with a small amount of food.

In such situations, it was said that you can trust your appetite.

Simply put, if you eat unrefined foods, you can eat when you're hungry and not eat when you're full.

It was also mentioned that the type of food you want to eat can indicate the nutrients you need.

For example, when following a low-calorie diet, you may crave high-calorie greasy foods.

When following a ketogenic diet that restricts carbohydrates, you often crave carbohydrate-rich foods.

However, at the end of the video, a question about the cake came up.

If I want to eat cake, is it a question of whether my body needs cake?

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

I want to eat cake.

If you are feeling this way, it means your body doesn't need cake, but rather...

It means that there is something you need to gain from eating cake.

So, what does the cake have?

First, it contains a lot of flour and sugar, so the carbohydrate content is high.

The second calorie is also quite high.

The third reason is that processed ingredients like flour and sugar are used, which makes digestion very quick.

So, cake is high in carbohydrates, has a high calorie content, and is digested quickly.

These are the three characteristics.

This is not just the case with cake; most processed foods are like this.

Snacks also have a high content of carbohydrates and calories, and they are processed, which makes them digest quickly.

Noodle dishes that use flour, as well as chicken and pizza, are the same.

Processed foods create false hunger from the start, which is why they contribute to our obesity.

It has a high content of carbohydrates and calories.

Digestion is quick, allowing a large amount of carbohydrates and energy to be absorbed in a short time.

This causes a lot of insulin to be released.

So, there is a drop in blood sugar levels, or energy is stored as body fat excessively.

It's because I often feel hungry and my body fat is rapidly increasing, leading to obesity.

Returning to the original story.

In that case, the reason for "I want to eat cake" is

Because my diet lacks carbohydrates,

I want to eat a cake that has a lot of carbohydrates.

Or it could be because my diet lacks calories.

I want to eat a high-calorie cake.

Or it could be because the diet I am following is not digesting and absorbing well.

I want to eat a cake that is easy to digest and absorb.

This can be interpreted like this.

Now that we know the reasons why we crave cake, let's try to address them one by one.

First, if the diet I am following is not digesting or absorbing well.

Basically, unprocessed, raw food refers to coarse food.

Rough food refers to food that is difficult to digest.

Because it is hard to digest, even if you eat a lot, the amount absorbed by the body is small.

So, it raises blood sugar slowly, and insulin is produced in smaller amounts, which means you don't gain weight even if you eat a lot.

If a person's digestive system is healthy, there won't be any problems when consuming unrefined foods.

However, in cases where there are issues with the digestive system or a person's basal metabolic rate has decreased,

When consuming processed foods, there are cases where digestion and absorption are significantly impaired, leading to problems.

Even if you eat food, if it is not digested or absorbed, your body will demand more food.

This causes an increase in appetite.

Unrefined foods can cause digestive issues and discomfort, so it's better to try them.

You don't want to eat unrefined food, and you start wanting to eat refined food.

If there is a problem with the digestive system, I understand that it cannot digest unrefined foods.

When the basal metabolic rate decreases, why is it that unrefined foods cannot be digested?

This is because the energy consumed by the digestive system is included in the basal metabolic rate.

Basal metabolic rate refers to the energy that a person fundamentally expends.

Most of this energy is consumed by organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, and digestive system.

A decrease in basal metabolic rate means that the energy consumed by these organs is reduced.

The reduction in energy consumption in the brain also means that its functionality is diminished.

The long-term includes the digestive system, and

So when the basal metabolic rate decreases, the function of the digestive system also decreases.

It is said that basal metabolic rate decreases as we age.

So, does just getting older weaken the digestive system?

Yes, that's right.

So as we get older, we tend to prefer softer foods.

If you have issues with your digestive system, you should visit a hospital for treatment.

If your basal metabolic rate has decreased, you need to raise it again.

In a situation where the basal metabolic rate has decreased, what can be done to recover it?

I talked about it in detail in the basal metabolic rate series I created before.

In the fifth video, I talked about solutions.

I will make sure to provide the link to the 5-part video on basal metabolic rate at the top right.

If you're curious about this part, you can click here to see it.

This time, there are no issues with the digestive system, but there is a lack of carbohydrates or calories.

In this case, filling in the lacking carbohydrates or calories will resolve the issue.

The problem is that it's hard to know whether we need carbohydrates, calories, or both.

So it's a good idea to make changes to your diet and check the results.

So try adding carbohydrates or fats to your diet and see how it goes.

It is to see how the desire for cake changes after that.

When I increased my carbohydrate intake, my cravings for cake decreased.

If that's the case, since the lack of carbohydrates was the cause, we can add carbohydrates to the diet going forward.

By adding fat to increase the calories, my craving for cake has decreased.

If that's the case, then the lack of calories is the cause, so from now on, you should increase the calories in your diet.

The additional nutrients at this time should naturally come from unrefined foods.

In the last video, you mentioned that most of the fats we consume are refined fats.

Yes, that's right.

So, when increasing refined fats, it is important to be careful not to eat too much.

In reality, when it comes to appetite due to a calorie deficit,

Just adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil will make it disappear.

So, to increase the calories, you should adjust the oil by adding about 5 to 10 grams, which is 1 to 2 tablespoons.

It means that it's okay to significantly increase unrefined carbohydrates to 100-200g.

In the last video, you mentioned that your body keeps changing.

So, do I need to change my diet like this every time?

Ah... it seems like it would be too bothersome.

Let's not think of it as a diet plan, but rather just as a meal.

No one eats the same food every day for 365 days a year.

If I had a certain food for lunch today, it makes sense to have a different food for lunch tomorrow.

So every day, I ponder what food to eat.

What I'm eating right now is a temporary diet plan because I'm on a diet.

Approaching it with this concept...

Changing my diet is bothersome and tedious. I just want to keep eating the same things.

Having such thoughts is the issue itself.

This way of thinking is not much different from the mindset of a one-food diet.

One food has simply expanded into a one-meal plan, but eating the same food continuously is still the same.

Refer to the video on distinguishing between fattening foods and weight-loss foods to understand the concept of unrefined foods.

When dieting, you should think of it not as a temporary meal plan, but as a change to your eating habits.

Sometimes when I eat unprocessed food

There is someone who tries to achieve perfect nutritional ratios in every meal.

However, it is not necessary to do it that way.

On days when you're craving meat, you can eat a lot of it.

I ate a lot of meat yesterday, so today I don't really want to eat much meat.

In that case, you can just have salad that day without eating any meat at all.

If my body needs something anyway, it makes me want to eat a lot of food.

You can make changes accordingly each time.

There are often comments asking what it's like to have a protein fasting day.

If you don't want to eat meat and choose not to, it's similar to having a protein fasting day.

So, don't impose any restrictions on your diet and eat freely.

This means that the food you eat at this time should preferably be unrefined.

I already eat a lot of vegetables, but could it be a lack of carbohydrates?

Vegetables generally have a significantly low carbohydrate content.

Some of those carbohydrates are dietary fibers that are not digestible.

People who are very active and exercise a lot may still have a deficiency in carbohydrates, even if they eat a lot of vegetables.

In this case, reduce the vegetables a little.

You should eat foods that are high in carbohydrates, like potatoes or sweet potatoes.

If that is still not enough, you should switch to whole grains like brown rice.

However, in another video, it is stated that ancient humans did not practice agriculture and only engaged in hunting and gathering.

I used to have a diet that included very little carbohydrates.

So you said that it's okay to eat carbohydrates in small amounts.

In the past, humanity likely could not eat whole grains, potatoes, or sweet potatoes with every meal.

I don't think you could even eat enough vegetables to feel full.

Then, if you eat plenty of vegetables every day, shouldn't you be getting enough carbohydrates?

Why do we lack carbohydrates even though we eat a lot of vegetables?

You mentioned that foods high in both carbohydrates and fats are the most fattening.

I am currently eating a lot of meat, so the calories in my diet are a bit high.

But I want to eat snacks.

I think there might be a slight deficiency in carbohydrates.

If you eat additional carbohydrates here,

I'm really worried that it has a lot of carbohydrates and high calories, and that I might gain weight. What should I do about this?

You mentioned to make slight changes to the diet.

I really want to eat a lot.

I'm scared that I might burst my mouth if I eat. What should I do?

In the previous video, Part 4, we discussed the reasons for needing to change your diet.

In this fifth video, we talked about ways to change your diet.

Even if both of these are understandable,

What should I do if I eat too much? This kind of anxiety leads to such questions.

In the next video, I will try to answer questions like that.

There should be two videos appearing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 6 of the appetite series,

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.
