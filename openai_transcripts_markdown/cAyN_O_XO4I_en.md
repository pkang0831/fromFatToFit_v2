The reason you don't lose weight even if you practice intermittent fasting - Glucagon Part 2

There was a comment asking for information about the hormone glucagon, which burns fat.

This is the second video in the series about glucagon.

First, let's briefly summarize the content of the first video.

Insulin is often referred to as a "fat-storing hormone" because it increases body fat.

Glucagon, which works in opposition to insulin, has the effect of reducing body fat.

That is why glucagon is referred to as the weight loss hormone.

Insulin and glucagon have opposing functions.

When insulin increases, glucagon decreases, and when insulin decreases, glucagon increases.

Therefore, if you want to increase glucagon to reduce body fat, you need to lower insulin.

To reduce insulin, you basically need to decrease the amount of food you eat.

There are mainly two ways to reduce the amount of food you eat.

The first is to increase the interval between meals.

The second is to reduce the amount of food consumed at one time.

One well-known method for increasing the intervals between meals is intermittent fasting.

In Part 1 of the video, we talked about this.

In this video, I would like to talk about the amount of food consumed in one sitting.

Reducing the amount of food you eat at one time means

It refers to eating a small amount of food at one meal.

But if you reduce the amount of food you eat, doesn't that become a low-calorie diet?

You can eat small amounts of food at a time, but do it frequently.

So, it's about eating a little bit often.

In the last video, I mentioned that eating food triggers insulin release.

You said that the insulin that comes out takes more than 12 hours to decrease, right?

If you eat a little bit often, insulin will keep being released, and in that case, glucagon will likely remain low.

Can this help with dieting?

In Part 1 of the video, it is based on a typical meal portion.

I conducted an experiment to check insulin levels.

It was mentioned that insulin levels decrease sharply between 12 to 24 hours.

The important point here is that the typical meal portion is the standard.

If the amount of food consumed is large, the insulin level increases significantly.

If the amount of food you eat is small, your insulin levels will rise less.

If insulin levels rise significantly, it takes a long time to lower them again.

If the insulin level increases slightly, it takes a shorter time to lower it again.

So it's possible to diet by eating a little bit frequently.

In recent times, with the trend of intermittent fasting, it has become common to skip breakfast.

In the past, it was believed that in order to diet, one must definitely eat breakfast.

I have also considered eating small amounts frequently as a fundamental approach to dieting.

In fact, many people have successfully lost weight using this method.

Conversely, if the amount of food eaten at one time is too much,

Because the insulin level rises too much.

It takes longer for this to go down again.

So even if you fast for 16 hours, there are cases where it may not be very effective.

Because of this, I should do intermittent fasting. It is said that I should not engage in intermittent binge eating.

Then, if you maintain a long fasting period and eat only a little, your insulin levels will be the lowest.

Is glucagon maintained at the highest level?

That's not the case.

For example, when making soup,

If you add too much salt or too little water, the soup will be very salty.

If you want to make the soup not too salty,

You need to reduce the amount of salt you add or increase the amount of water you add.

However, if you want to reduce the amount of salt you add, you need to keep the amount of water the same.

If you plan to add more water, you need to maintain the amount of salt you are adding.

If you add a lot of water and put in less salt, it will actually become bland.

Similarly, if you say that you will reduce the amount of food you eat,

You need to shorten the intervals between meals.

If you say you will extend the intervals between meals,

When you have a meal at once, you need to have a sufficient amount of food.

If the amount of food eaten at one time is small and the intervals between meals are long,

This is eating too little.

In this case, it just becomes a low-calorie diet.

A low-calorie diet can lead to a decrease in basal metabolic rate and suppress fat burning.

So, the level of insulin changes depending on the amount of food consumed.

If there is a lack of understanding in this area,

I thought that as long as I kept the fasting hours, I could eat as much as I wanted.

I sometimes engage in binge eating.

In my eagerness to lose weight quickly, I am trying to keep my fasting period as long as possible.

I also eat very little food, so I follow a low-calorie diet.

You are unable to distinguish between intermittent fasting, binge eating, and a low-calorie diet.

In this case, one might think they are practicing intermittent fasting, but...

In reality, it's not the case, so there are quite a few instances where it is ineffective.

You need to be able to clearly distinguish between intermittent fasting, binge eating, and low-calorie diets.

I previously covered intermittent fasting in detail in a series of videos.

In the next video, we will talk about nutrients and glucagon.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure it appears on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not the third part of the glucagon video.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
