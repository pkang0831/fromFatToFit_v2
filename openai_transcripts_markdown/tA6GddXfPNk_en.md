Soft fat that comes off quickly and hard fat that doesn't come off easily.

Hello, this is pkang.

There is a saying in diet discussions that firm fat doesn't come off easily, while soft fat tends to come off more easily.

There was a comment asking why there is such a story, and I'm curious about that.

In this video, I would like to talk about this.

Body fat is mainly divided into two types: visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.

The fat mentioned in the story of firm flesh and soft flesh refers to subcutaneous fat.

Visceral fat refers to the fat that is located next to the internal organs.

The internal organs are protected by bones and muscles, so they cannot be felt by hand.

Simply put, we cannot touch our internal organs by feeling our bodies.

This means that even the visceral fat attached to the organs cannot be felt.

In the end, firm flesh refers to firm subcutaneous fat.

Soft flesh refers to soft subcutaneous fat.

First of all, since it's the same subcutaneous fat, the rate of weight loss is not different.

Then why is it said that it is difficult to lose hard subcutaneous fat while it is easier to lose soft subcutaneous fat?

There are two arguments here.

The first claim is about cellulite.

Cellulite is formed when waste and moisture in the skin combine with subcutaneous fat to create firm lumps.

It is subcutaneous fat, but it has a particularly firm texture and is difficult to lose.

The term "cellulite" is widely known now, but...

In the past, this term was not widely known.

So the claim is that cellulite was simply referred to as firm flesh.

I previously covered in detail in a series of videos why cellulite forms and how to get rid of it.

If you are curious about cellulite, you can click the link in the upper right to watch the video.

The second argument is the amount of body fat.

If we take another look at the structure of subcutaneous fat, we can see that it is covered by the skin.

What will happen if the subcutaneous fat increases in this state?

It becomes solid.

If you think about a balloon, it becomes a bit easier to understand.

When you put a lot of air into a balloon, it swells up and becomes increasingly firm.

Similarly, if you put air, which is subcutaneous fat, into a balloon that represents the skin,

It is plump and firm.

Just like when the wind dies down, it becomes soft and squishy.

If there is a lot of subcutaneous fat, it becomes firm flesh, and if the subcutaneous fat decreases, it becomes soft flesh.

So, the order of the diet itself from the beginning is...

If you reduce subcutaneous fat from firm flesh, it becomes soft flesh.

If you reduce body fat here, it means you will succeed in your diet.

In this case, it's obvious that it's harder to lose firm flesh than soft flesh.

This means that there is more subcutaneous fat.

However, this story does not apply to everyone.

Everyone's skin is different.

There are people whose skin is thick and does not stretch easily.

Some people have thin and highly elastic skin.

In the case of individuals with thick and less elastic skin,

When there is an increase in subcutaneous fat, the skin does not stretch well and becomes firm.

People with thin and elastic skin

Even if subcutaneous fat increases, the skin can stretch well and maintain a soft condition.

So there are people who have a lot of body fat but still maintain soft flesh.

I will summarize.

When the discussion about soft flesh and firm flesh first came up,

There is a way to distinguish between fat that easily comes off just by touching it and fat that does not.

It became very famous and even appeared on TV broadcasts.

It doesn't apply the same way to everyone.

Even if there are people to whom it applies,

People with a lot of body fat take longer to lose weight. This is the level of discussion we are talking about.

It's a story that isn't talked about much lately.

If I have firm flesh.

It's that my skin doesn't stretch well or that I have a bit too much subcutaneous fat.

It's not that you have a particularly stubborn type of fat that won't go away.

You don't have to feel too depressed or frustrated. You can lose it all with dieting.

On the contrary, because of severe obesity, there is a lot of body fat.

Since it's soft flesh, it can be removed quickly, but it's better not to be overly confident.

Even if the skin stretches well and is soft,

If there is a lot of subcutaneous fat, it naturally takes a long time to lose it.
