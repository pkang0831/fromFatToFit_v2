Hello, this is pkang.

A question about cellulite was posted in the comments.

In this video, I will talk about cellulite.

First, let me briefly explain what cellulite is.

It refers to the situation where waste and moisture in the skin are not properly expelled and combine with subcutaneous fat to form lumps.

It is characterized by the skin surface appearing uneven.

The causes of cellulite are very diverse.

Since it is formed by the accumulation of subcutaneous fat, there is a strong perception that it is caused by having a lot of subcutaneous fat.

However, even individuals with obesity who have a lot of body fat can have cellulite.

Cellulite can occur in individuals with normal weight or even those who are very underweight, not just in those who are obese.

Many people wonder, "If I'm not obese, why do I have cellulite?"

So, from now on, I will talk about the reasons why cellulite occurs in the order of obesity, normal weight, and underweight.

First, cellulite related to obesity can be broadly divided into two types.

The first type is cellulite caused by the size of fat cells.

The second type is cellulite caused by inflammation.

Cellulite, which occurs due to the size of fat cells, arises from the difference between fat cells and connective tissue.

Fat cells are connected by connective tissue, and

When the amount of body fat increases, the soft fat cells grow larger.

The connective tissue that connects fat cells is firm, so it does not stretch.

So the part where the fat cells increase in size swells up.

The part of the connective tissue that does not increase in size will become sunken.

This will result in the formation of uneven cellulite.

Cellulite caused by the second inflammation.

This is also related to the amount of body fat.

Excess body fat has the characteristic of triggering inflammatory responses in the surrounding area.

In the case of men, body fat tends to accumulate primarily as visceral fat.

In women, body fat tends to accumulate primarily as subcutaneous fat.

So, the inflammation of visceral fat negatively affects the organs, leading to obesity-related diseases.

Inflammation in the subcutaneous fat causes the fat to clump together, leading to the formation of cellulite.

So even though they are both considered obesity, there aren't many men who worry about cellulite.

Most women have concerns about cellulite.

Why do men tend to accumulate visceral fat while women tend to accumulate subcutaneous fat?

I explained it in detail in a video about subcutaneous fat that I made earlier.

The video link is available in the top right corner, so if you're curious about the details, you can click to watch it.

Cellulite caused by the size of fat cells and cellulite caused by subcutaneous fat inflammation.

The cause of these two issues is the excess subcutaneous fat, so the solution is to reduce the amount of subcutaneous fat.

We discussed ways to reduce subcutaneous fat in parts 2 and 3 of the subcutaneous fat video.

Similarly, there is a video link in the top right corner, so if you're curious about how to reduce body fat, you can click and watch it.

The content you have discussed so far seems to be about people with a lot of body fat... in other words, it seems to be about obese individuals.

I have cellulite even though I have a normal weight. Why is this?

In this video, we talked about cellulite related to obesity.

In the next video, we will talk about people who have cellulite but are not obese and have a normal weight.

Once the video is completed, a video link will be added to the top right corner.

If there is no link, it means that the video is still being made, so I would appreciate it if you could wait a few more days.
