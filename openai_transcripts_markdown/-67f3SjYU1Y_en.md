Just changing the dish can help you lose weight! The illusion of gaining weight - Thoughts on dieting Part 1

Hello, this is pkang.

Those who have watched my videos a lot will know.

In my video, the diet rules are not that strict.

Other diets prohibit certain foods, but they allow small amounts.

The reason for doing this is not only to make the diet itself sustainable, but also to...

This is because perceptions and thoughts about dieting have a significant impact on dieting itself.

In this video, I would like to talk about this thought.

First of all, the reason people become obese is that they eat a lot of food, and

The biggest reason we end up eating a lot of food is because we consume processed and refined foods.

Refined foods cause a large release of insulin, creating false hunger.

Because of this false hunger, I end up eating more food than I actually need.

I explained this part in detail in the video [How to Distinguish Between Foods That Make You Gain Weight and Foods That Help You Lose Weight].

So, by reducing the intake of processed foods, fake hunger disappears, and unnecessary cravings decrease.

When unnecessary appetite decreases, it prevents overeating, which means not eating more food than needed.

It means that you can naturally lose weight.

Even if false hunger disappears, there are cases where people continue to overeat.

The problem lies in the eating habits from the beginning or in the way the diet is structured.

To explain this, I created a series of videos on satiety.

The content in this video is additional information that would be good to include in Part 1 of the satiety series.

In the first part of the video on satiety

A person who eats a lot and becomes obese is someone who initially prepares a lot of food.

When such a person goes on a diet, they tend to prepare too much food based on their usual habits.

When I don't eat processed foods and the false hunger disappears, I end up feeling full and unable to finish my food.

However, there are times when I feel full but still eat all the prepared food without leaving any behind.

It means that even when you're full, you force yourself to keep eating.

I was taught not to leave food when I was young, so I think leaving food is a wrong behavior.

I think it's a waste to leave food uneaten.

It's because throwing away leftover food seems bothersome and inconvenient.

In this case, the appetite has returned to normal, but the person is still overeating.

This is very bad for dieting.

I suggested a way to solve this by finding the right portion size for my body.

Even if you find the right portion size for yourself, there are times when it is difficult to reduce the amount of food.

I know in my head that I don't need to prepare this much food.

It looks like there is something lacking when seen with the eyes.

So, unconsciously, the amount gradually increases.

The reason this phenomenon occurs is due to an optical illusion.

There is an optical illusion known as the Delboeuf illusion.

It is a phenomenon where objects in a small bowl appear larger, and objects in a large bowl appear smaller.

When two circles overlap like this

Assuming the outer circle is a plate and the inner circle is food,

When you put food on a small plate, it looks like this.

When you put food on a large plate, it turns out like this.

At first glance, the inner circle on the left appears to be larger.

In fact, the sizes of the inner circles on the left and right are the same.

Depending on the size of the outer circle corresponding to the plate

The inner circle corresponding to the food appears larger or smaller.

Adding a gradient here will enhance the optical illusion effect.

In the picture shown earlier, only a gradient was added, but the optical illusion has become much more pronounced.

Food releases moisture, creating a natural gradient effect.

So, this Delboeuf illusion is applied quite strongly.

So, a person who has become obese from eating a lot of food...

I usually have a habit of eating a lot of food.

The dishes used are often large to match that eating habit.

If you reduce the amount of food while using a large bowl as it is,

The food appears to be less due to the optical illusion.

This means that unconsciously, one may increase the amount of food.

Of course, if you only prepare enough food to eat, it doesn't matter regardless of such illusions.

I try not to prepare too much food, but every time I end up preparing way too much.

This suggests that there may be issues related to this optical illusion effect.

Depending on the person, some individuals can be very strongly affected by optical illusions.

If you want to prepare less food but it's just not possible,

Changing the dish can also be a solution.

Is there a similar phenomenon besides the illusion related to bowls?

Yes, that's right. There is also a phenomenon related to calories.

In the next video, we will explore how the perception of calories itself affects dieting.

There should be two videos showing on the screen right now.

I will make sure to have it appear on the right once the next video is completed.

If the video on the right is not part 2 of the diet thoughts video.

I'm still in the process of making the video, so please wait a few more days.

I will return with the next video. Thank you.
