Hello, this is pkang.

This is the tenth video about a low-carb, high-fat diet.

In Part 1 of the video, the types of low-carb, high-fat diets are discussed.

In the second part of the video, a strange low-carb, high-fat diet is created by mixing two different meal plans.

In Part 3 of the video, we will discuss refined foods and unrefined foods.

In Part 4 of the video, a balanced diet is discussed.

In part 5 of the video, a recommended low-carb, high-fat diet is discussed.

In the sixth video, we discuss low-carbohydrate diets and insulin.

In Episode 7, we discuss low-carb diets and exercise.

In the 8th video, the reason why you don't have to eat a lifelong diet is explained.

In the ninth video, we talked about why body fat decreases even when not eating insufficiently.

In this video, we will explore the reasons why the effects of a low-carb, high-fat diet differ between men and women.

Since the content of the video is all connected, it is recommended to watch it in order starting from Part 1.

If you haven't watched the previous video, please click the playlist link in the top right corner.

You can watch the videos in order starting from Part 1.

As mentioned in the first part of the video, there are several types of low-carb, high-fat diets.

In some of those diets, different effects may appear for men and women.

Since the first part of the video, we have categorized diets into three main types based on carbohydrates.

The first is the ketogenic diet, which involves consuming unrefined carbohydrates while severely restricting carbohydrate intake.

The ketogenic diet is a diet aimed at putting the body into a state of ketosis, which is characterized by a lack of carbohydrates.

The second is a diet that limits carbohydrate intake to a certain extent while consuming unrefined carbohydrates.

I limit carbohydrate intake, but I don't restrict it to the extent of entering a state of ketosis.

It can be called an unrefined low-carbohydrate diet.

The third is a diet that allows you to eat unrefined carbohydrates, meaning you don't have to restrict carbohydrates.

The long-term diet applies here.

All three of these diets have the condition that you must consume unrefined carbohydrates.

A diet that consumes less refined carbohydrates like sugar, flour, and white rice has a lower intake of carbohydrates.

So they all fall under a low-carbohydrate diet.

Are you restricting your body to the point of entering ketosis?

I do limit carbohydrates, but it's not to the extent of reaching a state of ketosis, is it?

Or do you not limit the intake of carbohydrates itself?

This can be divided into three categories.

First, when following a ketogenic diet for an extended period of time.

The ketogenic diet is a diet that puts the body into a state of ketosis.

Ketosis is an emergency state in the body due to a lack of carbohydrates.

If the state of ketosis lasts for a long time, the stress on the body increases.

When the body experiences increased stress, the secretion of the stress hormone cortisol rises.

When cortisol secretion increases, various health problems arise that are not good for you.

This is why stress is called the root of all ailments, and it is said that we need to reduce stress.

Cortisol has a wide range of effects on the body, but if we focus only on those related to dieting,

It breaks down muscle to lower the body's metabolic rate and raises blood sugar levels to increase insulin secretion.

It increases appetite and makes it easy for body fat to accumulate.

The cause of obesity and diabetes is cortisol.

There is a claim that stress can lead to obesity and diabetes.

When following a ketogenic diet for a short period, the stress on the body is minimal, so it's manageable.

When following a ketogenic diet for a long period, it can actually have negative effects on weight loss.

In fact, many people who have followed a ketogenic diet for a long time have experienced weight gain and plateaus.

I often find myself looking for keto snacks because my appetite increases between meals and I want to eat something.

In the case of women, they react more sensitively to cortisol than men do.

Such symptoms can appear more quickly and more severely.

There has actually been an experiment conducted on rats.

When female and male rats were fed a diet containing 3% carbohydrates.

After 15 weeks, the male rat's weight has decreased compared to the beginning.

In the case of female mice, it was found that their weight increased compared to the beginning.

So even if they eat the same thing, men can lose weight while women may gain weight.

So, following a ketogenic diet for a long time is not good for men, but it is even worse for women.

If a woman gains weight while following a ketogenic diet, wouldn't there be no women doing the ketogenic diet?

However, there are many women who follow a ketogenic diet, right?

The reason many women follow a ketogenic diet is mainly due to two factors.

The first reason is the very rapid weight loss in the early stages.

Carbohydrates have the characteristic of being stored in the body with water.

By reducing carbohydrate intake and lowering the body's carbohydrates, water will be lost, resulting in weight loss.

The less carbohydrates you eat, the faster the water is released from your body, leading to quicker weight loss.

Therefore, the more severely a person restricts carbohydrates, the more they tend to experience rapid weight loss in the beginning.

It's not that body fat has been lost; it's just that water has been lost, so it doesn't mean that I've actually lost weight.

Anyway, many women prefer the ketogenic diet because they have lost weight.

So in the early stages of starting a ketogenic diet, water weight is lost quickly, leading to rapid weight loss.

After that, for a while, my body fat decreased and my weight also went down.

If the period of following a ketogenic diet is prolonged, it can lead to an increase in cortisol secretion, resulting in problems.

Therefore, women who have been on a ketogenic diet for a long time often experience plateaus and weight gain.

The second case is for women with low levels of female hormones.

In the rat experiment mentioned earlier,

When the ovaries of female rats were removed to induce a decrease in the secretion of female hormones,

The results showed a decrease in weight similar to that of male rats.

So, in cases where the secretion of female hormones is low or in postmenopausal women,

Even when following a ketogenic diet for a long time, one can experience more significant weight loss effects, similar to men.

For these two reasons, there are women who have been following the ketogenic diet for a long time.

Even if a woman or man is less sensitive to cortisol, it means they are less sensitive, but it doesn't mean they do not react at all.

If you continue the ketogenic diet, there will eventually be negative effects.

Therefore, following a ketogenic diet for a long period of time is not good, regardless of whether you are male or female.

Second unrefined low-carbohydrate diet

This diet does not induce a state of ketosis, but it is a diet that intentionally consumes fewer carbohydrates.

This diet may have different effects on men and women.

In the case of men, when body fat accumulates, it mainly accumulates as visceral fat.

When a person becomes obese, the visceral fat pushes up the abdominal muscles, causing the belly to swell like a balloon.

On the contrary, in the case of women, when body fat accumulates, it mainly accumulates as subcutaneous fat.

The belly doesn't swell up like a balloon, but loose and jiggly fat starts to form all over the body.

In the seventh video, it was mentioned that diet is effective for reducing visceral fat, while exercise is effective for reducing subcutaneous fat.

So, men who need to reduce visceral fat can see significant results through diet alone, without exercise.

Women who need to reduce body fat will find it difficult to see significant results through diet alone without exercise.

In order for a woman to lose weight, she ultimately needs to exercise.

However, if carbohydrates are restricted, the muscles cannot exert strength.

You may lack the motivation to exercise, or even if you do exercise, you quickly become exhausted.

So, an unrefined low-carbohydrate diet is effective for men, but

It may not be effective for women.

For men who want to build muscle, a non-refined low-carbohydrate diet is not ideal.

Because it interferes with exercising.

Third pkang Diet

This diet is based on the type of carbohydrates we consume, which are unrefined carbohydrates.

This is a diet that no longer requires you to restrict carbohydrates.

The reason we eat a lot of carbohydrates and become obese is that

This is because the carbohydrates we consume are refined carbohydrates like sugar, flour, and white rice.

If you reduce refined carbohydrates and consume unrefined carbohydrates instead,

This means that this is already enough to reduce carbohydrates.

If we artificially reduce it further, the problems mentioned earlier will arise, so we should avoid reducing it that way.

In the next video, I plan to conclude the low-carb, high-fat diet series.

I will summarize the content so far and conclude by discussing only the rules of the pkang diet.

There should be two videos playing on the screen right now.

Once the next video is completed, I will make sure it appears on the right.

If the video on the right is not part 11 of the low-carb, high-fat diet, please wait a few days as I am still in the process of making the video.
