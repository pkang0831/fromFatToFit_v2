        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A medical diagnosis or clinical assessment.</li>

        <h2>2. AI Estimation Accuracy</h2>
        <p>
          The Service uses artificial intelligence models to generate estimates and analyses. These AI systems
          have inherent limitations:
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Body Fat Estimation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>AI-based body fat percentage estimates are <strong>rough approximations</strong> derived from visual analysis of photos. They are NOT equivalent to clinical methods such as DEXA scans, hydrostatic weighing, or skinfold caliper measurements.</li>
          <li>Accuracy varies significantly based on photo quality, lighting, posture, clothing, camera angle, and individual body characteristics.</li>
          <li>Results should NOT be used to diagnose obesity, underweight conditions, eating disorders, or any medical condition.</li>
          <li>Body fat percentile rankings are based on general population data and may not accurately reflect your specific demographic group.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Calorie and Nutritional Estimates</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Calorie and macronutrient estimates from food photos are <strong>approximations</strong>. Actual values may vary significantly based on portion size, preparation method, ingredients, and other factors not visible in photos.</li>
          <li>TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) calculations are based on general formulas and may not accurately reflect your individual metabolism.</li>
          <li>Calorie burn estimates for workouts are based on standardized MET values and may not reflect your actual energy expenditure.</li>
          <li>Do not rely solely on these estimates for managing medical conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, food allergies, or other health conditions that require precise nutritional monitoring.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Body Transformation Previews</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>AI-generated body transformation images are <strong>artistic digital renderings</strong> and do NOT represent guaranteed, expected, or realistic results.</li>
          <li>Actual body changes depend on genetics, adherence to diet and exercise, medical conditions, medications, and many other individual factors.</li>
          <li>These previews should be treated as creative visualizations, not as predictions or promises.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.4 AI Coaching</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The AI chatbot provides <strong>general fitness and nutrition information</strong> based on publicly available knowledge. It is not a certified personal trainer, dietitian, or medical professional.</li>
          <li>AI responses may contain inaccuracies, outdated information, or advice that is not appropriate for your specific situation.</li>
          <li>Never follow AI coaching advice that contradicts guidance from your healthcare provider.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Health Risks</h2>
        <p>
          Physical exercise and dietary changes carry inherent risks. By using this Service, you acknowledge:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Exercise Risk:</strong> Physical activity involves risk of injury, illness, or death. You should consult a physician before beginning any exercise program, especially if you have a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or other medical conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Dietary Risk:</strong> Calorie restriction, fasting, and dietary changes can have adverse health effects, particularly for individuals with diabetes, eating disorders, pregnancy, or other medical conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Intermittent Fasting:</strong> Fasting protocols are not suitable for everyone. People with diabetes, hypoglycemia, eating disorders, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and those on certain medications should NOT fast without medical supervision.</li>
          <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Rapid weight loss or extreme calorie restriction can be dangerous. The Service&apos;s goal projections are mathematical estimates and should not motivate unsafe weight loss practices.</li>
          <li><strong>Allergies and Intolerances:</strong> AI food analysis may fail to identify allergens or ingredients that could cause adverse reactions. If you have food allergies or intolerances, always verify ingredients manually.</li>
        </ul>
