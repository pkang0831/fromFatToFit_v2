# FromFatToFit — Pre-Production QA Report

**Date:** February 22, 2026  
**Scope:** Full-stack audit — backend, frontend, UX, security, competitive analysis  
**Status:** 9 critical/high bugs fixed, remaining items documented below

---

## Executive Summary

The application is a full-stack AI-powered fitness platform built with FastAPI (Python) + Next.js 14 (TypeScript). It covers calorie tracking, AI food analysis, workout logging, body composition analysis, weight projection, and an AI diet coach chatbot. The codebase is well-structured with clear separation of concerns, but had **5 critical bugs** and **6 high-severity issues** that have now been fixed. Remaining items are medium/low priority and documented for post-launch iteration.

## 1. Backend Audit

### 1.1 Architecture Overview

- **Framework:** FastAPI with Pydantic v2 schemas
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **AI Providers:** OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini), Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Grok, Replicate (FLUX Kontext Pro)
- **Payments:** Stripe + RevenueCat
- **Auth:** JWT via Supabase Auth, middleware-based validation
- **11 API routers**, **20+ service modules**, **~50 endpoints**

### 1.2 Remaining Issues (Not Fixed — Prioritized for Post-Launch)

| Priority | Issue | Impact | Effort |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| HIGH | Race condition in credit deduction (double-spending) | Financial loss | Requires Supabase RPC function |
| HIGH | Service key bypasses RLS on all queries | Security risk if any query filter is missing | Major refactor |
| HIGH | Forbes equation always clamps to minimum (6000 kcal/kg) | Inaccurate weight projections | Formula review needed |
| HIGH | Stripe webhook has no idempotency protection | Duplicate credit grants on retries | Add event ID tracking table |
| MEDIUM | Chat message rate limit has race condition | Can exceed daily limit with concurrent requests | Database-level constraint |
| MEDIUM | Food database endpoints have no authentication | Data scraping risk | Add auth dependency |
| MEDIUM | Notification preferences accepts arbitrary dict | Input validation gap | Add Pydantic schema |
| MEDIUM | Workout date range uses raw strings, no validation | Potential query errors | Change to `date` type |
| MEDIUM | Food/workout trends have no upper bound on `days` param | Resource exhaustion | Add `Query(7, ge=1, le=365)` |
| MEDIUM | CORS allows all methods and headers | Overly permissive | Restrict to specific methods |
| LOW | Login response missing `onboarding_completed` field | May show onboarding to completed users | Add field to response |
| LOW | Health endpoint leaks environment info | Info disclosure | Conditional on env |
| LOW | `datetime.utcnow()` deprecated in Python 3.12+ | Future compatibility | Migrate to `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` |
| LOW | Inconsistent `date` column quoting in queries | Subtle query failures | Standardize quoting |
| LOW | RevenueCat verification uses receipt as app_user_id | Incorrect API usage | Pass actual user_id |

### 1.3 Dependencies (requirements.txt)

All dependencies use `>=` version constraints, which is appropriate for development but should be pinned to exact versions for production reproducibility.

## 4. Security Audit

### 4.1 Authentication & Authorization

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| JWT validation | ✅ Good | Via Supabase Auth |
| Password hashing | ✅ Good | Handled by Supabase |
| Token storage | ⚠️ Medium | localStorage (XSS risk); cookies also used |
| CORS | ⚠️ Medium | Origins restricted, but methods/headers wide open |
| Rate limiting | ❌ Missing | No API-level rate limiting (except chat daily limit) |
| Input validation | ⚠️ Medium | Most endpoints validate via Pydantic, some gaps |
| SQL injection | ✅ Good | Supabase client handles parameterization |
| Secrets management | ✅ Good | All keys from env vars, no hardcoded secrets |

### 4.2 Critical Security Recommendations

1. **Add API rate limiting** — Use slowapi or similar to prevent abuse
2. **Implement CSRF protection** — Especially for state-changing endpoints
3. **Restrict CORS methods/headers** — Only allow what's needed
4. **Fix RLS bypass** — Use user-scoped Supabase client for user queries
5. **Add Content Security Policy headers** — Prevent XSS
6. **Sanitize AI responses** — AI-generated content could contain XSS payloads

## 8. Final Assessment

### Overall Score: 7.5/10

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Code Quality** | 8/10 | Well-structured, clear separation. Some type safety gaps. |
| **Feature Completeness** | 8/10 | Rich feature set. Missing barcode scan and wearables. |
| **Security** | 6/10 | Auth is solid, but needs rate limiting, RLS enforcement, CSP. |
| **Performance** | 7/10 | Adequate for launch. Needs caching and image optimization. |
| **UX/UI** | 8/10 | Clean, modern. Needs toast system and error boundaries. |
| **Production Readiness** | 7/10 | Critical bugs fixed. Still needs rate limiting and monitoring. |
| **Competitive Position** | 7/10 | Strong AI differentiation. Barcode scanner is a critical gap. |

### Verdict

**Ready for soft launch / beta** with the critical bugs now fixed. The must-have checklist items should be completed before a public launch. The app has strong differentiation in AI body analysis and transformation preview — these should be the marketing leads. The biggest competitive risk is the missing barcode scanner, which is table-stakes in the calorie tracking market.
